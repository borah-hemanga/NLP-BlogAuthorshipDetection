Feds seek to lock press, public out of Portland bomb trial | <paragraph>  Federal prosecutors have moved to lock the press and public out of testimony by undercover FBI personnel at the upcoming trial of an Oregon man accused of plotting to bomb a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland in 2010.  <paragraph>  In order to keep the identities of the undercover agents secret, prosecutors want to close the courtroom at Mohamed Mohamud’s trial while the agents testify. The press and public could sit in another courtroom and watch a partially-obscured video feed in which the “images” of the undercover FBI employees would not be visible.  <paragraph>  Prosecutors also want to alter the appearance of their key witnesses—a little bit, anyway.  <paragraph>  “The [undercover employees] may testify using a light disguise, such as changing the UCEs’ facial hair, hairstyle, or dress style,” prosecutors wrote in an Oct. 23 motion (posted   <hyperlink> here). “When the UCEs testify, only the Court, essential personnel, the jury, the defendant and his counsel, and the government’s trial team shall be present in the courtroom.”  <paragraph>  Mohamud’s lawyers have objected to the secrecy.  <paragraph>  “The measures sought by the government would convey information or impressions to the jury that undermine the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial based solely on the evidence," defense attorneys Steve Sady and Steve Wax wrote in their response (posted   <hyperlink> here). "Such restrictions have also historically been disfavored as unfairly prejudicial to the defense, because jurors who witness such precautions are likely to assume that the defendant is especially dangerous and thus guilty."  <paragraph>  “Any disguise that would actually conceal the operatives’ identities would almost certainly obscure their facial expressions. Assessing facial expression is critical to a fact finder’s assessment of a witness’s credibility, and even to counsel’s fine-tuning of the examination of that witness,” the defense added.  <paragraph>  The defense lawyers also noted that, regardless of whether the court authorizes any special measures to protect the FBI employees, their client could easily recognize them. “Mr. Mohamud himself, of course, has long been in a position to identify the operatives by sight, as he spent hours on end in their presence and following their directions,” the defense attorneys added.  <paragraph>  Prosecutors are also seeking to keep the true names of the operatives from the defense on the grounds that their identities are classified. The operatives are involved in ongoing undercover investigations, the government says.  <paragraph>  The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees defendants a public trial. Courts have also interpreted the First Amendment to require that criminal proceedings be open to the public. However, partial closures of trials have been upheld in unusual or exceptional circumstances.  <paragraph>  The secrecy measures the government is seeking are unusual, but have been employed in several federal criminal trials in recent years. Similar measures were used to obscure the identities of Israeli government security personnel who testified against Palestinian activists at terror-finance related trials in Tampa, Chicago and Dallas. Just last month, the Supreme Court declined to take up an appeal stemming from the Dallas trial, which involved leaders of the Holy Land Foundation charity.  <paragraph>  While measures such as trial closures, disguises and the like have been used only rarely in American courtrooms up to this point, the rationale supporting them would appear to apply in numerous cases, since undercover informants are frequently used in drug, gang and organized crime prosecutions.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Court Judge Garr King has yet to rule on the motion. The trial for Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia, is set to get underway Jan. 15.
Cuomo: Storm victims can vote anywhere in New York |  <paragraph>  Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) announced Monday that New York residents displaced by Hurricane Sandy can cast ballots anywhere in the state.  <paragraph>  "We want everyone to vote. Just because people are displaced doesn't mean they should be disenfranchised," Cuomo said at a news conference, according to the Asssociated Press.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> On Twitter, Cuomo indicated that permission to vote "by affidavit" had been granted to residents of Rockland and Westchester counties, Long Island and New York City.  <paragraph>  Civil rights and voting rights groups had urged Cuomo to issue such an order, much as N.J. Gov. Chris Christie's administration did on Saturday.  <paragraph>  Cuomo said all voters will be able to cast ballots for president and U.S. Senate, but only those voters who go to a precinct in their home district will be able to vote for state Senate, assembly and local offices.  <paragraph>  "You can't vote for what we call down-ballot individuals," Cuomo said. "Your vote will not be eligible."
Judge unseals Liddy Watergate trial records | <paragraph>  A federal judge has ordered the release of long-sealed records relating to the 1973 trial of Watergate conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and James McCord, both of whom served as officials of President Richard Nixon's re-election bid.  <paragraph>  Chief Judge Royce Lamberth, acting on a petition from Texas A&M history professor Luke Nichter, issued an order Friday setting in motion the unsealing.  <paragraph>  Lamberth's order (posted   <hyperlink> here) unseals all records in the case apart from grand jury records, sentencing reports relating to living individuals, and "documents reflecting the contents of illegally obtained wiretaps." The Justice Department had agreed with unsealing of the Liddy case records, aside from those three categories.  <paragraph>  In an interview Friday, Nichter hailed the judge's decision. "The National Archives has told me they have an enormous quantity of Watergate records still sealed," the professor said. "They've told me they hope to bring these documents out of legal limbo, but you can't get them under [the Freedom of Information Act.] It takes extraordinary action by a judge to bring them out."  <paragraph>  Nichter said he believes at least some of the sealed records relate to Alfred Baldwin, a potential witness in the Libby case who was involved in wiretapping the Democratic National Committee's Watergate office that was broken into. Prosecutors sought to put Baldwin on the stand, but third-parties—apparently those overheard in the wiretaps—managed to block his testimony.  <paragraph>  Nichter said he sees little reason to keep the records sealed at this juncture. "A lot of folks involved in these events four decades ago are deceased. And, in light of later scandals, is it really necessary to keep all this secret?" he asked.  <paragraph>  Lamberth also gave the Justice Department 30 days to inventory all other sealed materials in the case and to explain why those records must remain sealed.So, more disclosures seem possible, even within the categories the Justice Department wants kept sealed.  <paragraph>  However, the judge rejected Nichter's request for a court-supervised investigation into what the professor termed breaches of grand jury secrecy by reporters for the Washington Post.  <paragraph>  Five other men were charged in the same case as Libby and McCord, but pled guilty before the trial. They included former CIA officer and White House aide E. Howard Hunt Jr. After the 16-day trial, a jury quickly convicted McCord and Liddy of conspiracy, burglary and electronic eavesdropping.  <paragraph>  Liddy was sentenced to 20-years in prison, but served a little over four years before he was paroled after receiving a commutation from President Jimmy Carter. McCord was sentenced to one to five years in that case and served about two months.
Guilty plea in works over CIA leak | <paragraph>  Former Central Intelligence Agency officer John Kiriakou, who's accused of disclosing the identities of colleagues who interrogated suspected terrorists, may be on the verge of offering a guilty plea in the case.  <paragraph>  On Monday afternoon, an entry was added to the electronic docket of the federal court in Alexandria, Va. for a "change of plea" hearing at 11 A.M. Tuesday before U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema.  <paragraph>  Defense attorney Robert Trout declined to comment on the proposed plea, beyond confirming the docket entry. "That’s about all I’m going to say at this point," Trout said in a brief interview Monday afternoon.  <paragraph>  Kiriakou was indicted in April on three counts of violating the Espionage Act by disclosing classified information, one count of violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act by exposing a covert officer, and one count of attempting to defraud the CIA's Publication Review Board.  <paragraph>  A source close to the case told POLITICO Monday that Kiriakou was offered a deal under which he'd plead guilty to one IIPA count and receive a sentence of two years, six months in custody. However, Kiriakou has been wavering about whether to accept it over the past week, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  <paragraph>  Last week,  <hyperlink> Brinkema canceled without explanation two important hearings scheduled in the case. Such an action often signals that a guilty plea is imminent. However, no guilty plea is final until accepted by a judge, who conducts an in-court exchange with the defendant to make sure he is certain about his wishes and fully informed of the consequences of the decision.  <paragraph>  Kiriakou's supporters say he's being persecuted because of the role he played in disclosing the CIA's use of controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding. The Justice Department has denied any such retribution is behind the charges.
Allen campaign, NRSC pulled DC radio buys | <paragraph>  George Allen's U.S. Senate campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee each recently canceled two weeks of radio ads across the D.C. metro area, according to documents obtained by POLITICO.  <paragraph>  Allen's campaign and the GOP committee said the cancellations were routine reallocations of advertising in the race to replace retiring Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.)  <paragraph>  "We were going up on TV around that time and we bought radio outside" the D.C. area instead, Dan Allen of the George Allen campaign said Tuesday.  <paragraph>  "It’s common for both parties to adjust reservations in the final weeks and to shift money between TV and radio. But we have long viewed Virginia as one of our top takeover opportunities, and the millions of dollars we are spending in this race reflects that," the NRSC's Brian Walsh said.  <paragraph>  Records obtained by POLITICO show that on Sept. 19, Allen's media buyers notified radio stations in the D.C. area of a "marketwide" cancellation of ads set to run from Sept. 25 to Oct. 8.  <paragraph>  And on Sept. 27, the NRSC's media buyers told radio stations that it was backing out of reservations in the D.C. market for Oct. 10 to Oct. 23.  <paragraph>  A Republican source said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee doesn’t currently have any radio ad time reserved in Virginia, but as of now the NRSC is still booked on the radio for the final three weeks of the campaign.  <paragraph>  However, Allen rival Tim Kaine's campaign has its own radio ad time booked from late August through November. The records reviewed by POLITICO did not show any Kaine cancellations of radio time on major D.C. stations during the period.
Did Obama back bans on hate speech? |  <paragraph>  A report Monday on The Daily Caller website argues that when President Barack Obama was a student at Harvard Law School he endorsed the idea of restricting speech in order to protect minorities.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> The report is a bit short, though, on specifics to back up its conclusion. It hangs largely on a 13-word quote from a panel discussion in which Obama said: "I don’t see a lot of conservatives getting upset if minorities feel silenced." The Caller also cites the recollection of a participant in the panel discussion, Brian Timmons, that all the six panelists except him "promoted the same view." However, Timmons is not quoted offering any specific recollection of what the future president said during the discussion, which included future Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.  <paragraph>  A close reading of the underlying source material, a write-up in the Harvard Law School yearbook, suggests the panel discussed a variety of different subjects ranging from whether an atmosphere of political correctness was unwisely limiting the number of views on campus to whether rules or laws should be imposed to protect minorities from offensive speech. (One of the earliest forays in this battle, a University of Michigan code banning racist or sexist speech, was struck down by a federal court in 1989.)  <paragraph>  Frankly, it wouldn't be surprising if Obama sided with those less supportive of free speech in the campus battles of the 1980s and early 1990s. Many prominent scholars on the left seemed enamored by that position in that era, including  <hyperlink> another future Supreme Court justice, Elena Kagan. The issue split groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, though the pro-free-speech forces ultimately carried the day. <paragraph>  However, the Caller's evidence stops short of putting Obama firmly in the speech-restricting camp. The direct quote reads like a rebuttal to someone else's argument, not a direct endorsement of a particular position or policy. And, of course, it was more than 20 years ago, while he was a student, so not the greatest evidence of his current views.  <paragraph>  Still, it's an interesting data point, especially at a time when the question of offensive speech is in the news as a result of the violence in the Muslim world directed at an anti-Muslim video produced in the U.S.  <paragraph>  Obama didn't offer a vocal defense of free speech principles in his first public comments on the video, though later that same day he said in an interview: "We believe in the First Amendment. It is one of the hallmarks of our Constitution that I’m sworn to uphold.  And so we are always going to uphold the rights for individuals to speak their mind. On the other hand, this film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that."  <paragraph>  Obama also presented  <hyperlink> a vigorous defense of free speech principles at the United Nations last month.
A pollster under oath | <paragraph>  This post has been updated. See below.  <paragraph>  When a pollster or strategist for a struggling political campaign presents what seems like a sugar-coated view of his candidate's chances, do you ever think: I wish I could give that adviser some truth serum, or maybe put him under oath? <paragraph>  Well, truth serum may be pushing it, but the put-him-under-oath part has actually happened. And when a pollster is required to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, under penalty of perjury, what emerges is quite a bit different than what you hear in the waning days of a presidential campaign.  <paragraph>  In May, the pollster for   <hyperlink> Al Gore's presidential bid in 2000 and John Edwards's in 2004 and 2008, Harrison Hickman, took the stand in the federal criminal case against Edwards over alleged campaign finance violations stemming from payments to support Edwards's mistress.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> See also: PHOTOS: John Edwards on trial)  <paragraph>  Under oath, Hickman admitted that in the final weeks of Edwards's 2008 bid, Hickman cherry-picked public polls to make the candidate seem viable, promoted surveys that Hickman considered unreliable, and sent e-mails to campaign aides, Edwards supporters and reporters which argued that the former senator was still in the hunt —even though Hickman had already told   <hyperlink> Edwards privately that he had no real chance of winning the Democratic nomination.  <paragraph>  "They were pounding on me for positive information. You know, where is some good news we can share with people? We were monitoring all these polls and I was sending the ones that were most favorable because [campaign aides] wanted to share them with reporters," Hickman testified on May 14 at the trial in Greensboro, N.C. "We were not finding very much good news and I was trying to give them what I could find."  <paragraph>  Hickman testified that when circulating the polls, he didn't much care if they were accurate. "I didn't necessarily take any of these as for—as you would say, for the truth of the matter. I took them more as something that could be used as propaganda for the campaign," the veteran pollster said.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: The parallel universe where Mitt Romney leads all polls)  <paragraph>  Edwards's viability from late 2007 through January 2008 was a hotly disputed issue at his trial because federal prosecutors were seeking to prove that nearly $1 million in expenses Edwards backers paid for his mistress in and around that time frame amounted to donations to advance his bid for the presidency. Edwards's defense contended that his inner circle viewed his prospects of winning the presidency as zero or close to it, once Sen. Barack Obama's juggernaut gathered steam, so the payments must have been made out of personal affection for Edwards or for some other reason unrelated to the presidential campaign.  <paragraph>  However, Hickman's testimony also opened a rare window into the way major presidential campaigns try to use polling numbers to spin the press and laid bare the fact that top campaign operatives sometimes propound a version of the truth starkly at odds with what they themselves believe.  <paragraph>  Hickman, called by the former senator's defense, testified that he told Edwards in "early to middle of November 2007," that the campaign wasn't going to succeed.  <paragraph>  "I told him that the odds were overwhelming that we were not going—that he was not going to be the nominee for president. I mean, we talked about a variety of things might change, do differently, and all that, but none of them translated into winning the nomination," the pollster told Edwards attorney Alan Duncan.  <paragraph>  However, under cross-examination by lead prosecutor David Harbach, Hickman acknowledged sending a series of emails in November and December, and even into January, endorsing or promoting polls that made Edwards look good. Asked about what appeared to be   <hyperlink> a New York Times/CBS poll released in mid-November showing an effective "three-way tie" in Iowa with Hillary Clinton at 25 percent, Edwards at 23 percent and Obama at 22 percent, Hickman acknowledged he circulated it but insisted he didn't think it was correct.  <paragraph>  "The business I'm in is a business any fool can get into, and a lot can happen. I'm sure there was a poll like that," the folksy Hickman told jurors when first asked about a poll showing the race tied. "I kept up with every poll that was done, including our own, and there may have been a few that showed them a tie, but... that's not really what my analysis is. Campaigns are about trajectory, and... there could have been a point at which it was a tie in the sense that we were coming down, and Obama was going up, and Clinton was going up."  <paragraph>  Hickman also indicated that senior campaign staffers knew many of the polls were poorly done and of little value. "We didn't take these dog and cat and baby-sitter polls seriously," he said.  <paragraph>  Hickman acknowledged that on January 2, 2008, a day before the Iowa caucuses, he sent out a summary of nine post-Christmas Iowa polls showing Edwards in contention in the Hawkeye State. However, he testified two-thirds of them were from firms he considered "ones we typically would not put a lot of credence in." Hickman put Mason-Dixon, Strategic Vision, Insider Advantage, Zogby and Research 2000 in the "less reputable" group. He also told the court that ARG polls "have a miserable track record."  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> See also: POLITICO polling center)  <paragraph>  Hickman said he considered the Des Moines Register polls, CNN and Los Angeles Times polls more accurate. (A full transcript of his testimony is posted   <hyperlink> here.)  <paragraph>  The prosecutor was clearly trying to suggest that Edwards was more viable than Hickman, a longtime friend of the ex-senator, admitted in his initial testimony. Harbach may have even been trying to suggest that Hickman's basic credibility was impugned by the heavy spin he acknowledged offering late in the 2008 primary campaign. However, the line of questioning was baffling to reporters in the courtroom who seemed not at all surprised that a campaign would insist on its viability until moments before the candidate dropped out or lost. <paragraph>  In short, to many journalists, what Hickman admitted doing in late 2007 and 2008 was no more a sign of bad character than an actor spinning a yarn on stage during a play or a lawyer mounting an implausible defense for a clearly guilty client.  <paragraph>  When the defense got to question Hickman again, he was unapologetic about what he termed an effort to "keep up morale" among Edwards backers and aides.  <paragraph>  "They were being inundated with bad news. I didn't have to give them bad news. I was trying to pick out morsels, you know, acorns. Out of a big stack of acorns, I was trying to pick out a few good ones that they could pass along to other people, you know, to keep them working," Hickman testified. "I mean, I wasn't going to say, you know, all hope is lost, you know, take a couple of weeks off. I mean, that was not the object of it. I mean, the object was to keep going as hard as we could. And we all worked as hard as we could. I mean, the working hard and promoting the candidacy are independent, in my mind, to the evaluation of what the likely outcome is."  <paragraph>  Asked if what he did to that end in the 2008 race was at all unusual when compared with other contests, Hickman told Duncan: "No. No. I did -- you know, I did what I was supposed to do…. I did my job the way I've always done my job."  <paragraph>  While the discussion of polling and the legitimate bounds of spin did offer an unusual behind-the-scenes look at a major presidential campaign, it's not at all clear that it had any impact on the outcome of the case against Edwards. Indeed, U.S. District Court Judge Catherine Eagles at one point admonished Hickman and Duncan that the grad-school polling seminar seemed pretty tangential to anything jurors were being asked to consider.  <paragraph>  "I don't think we need quite this much detail about particular polls," the judge said.  <paragraph>  "That's fine, your honor," Duncan replied.  <paragraph>  "I'm sorry," Hickman quickly chimed in.  <paragraph>  After nine days of deliberation, the jury revealed on May 31 that it had   <hyperlink> acquitted Edwards on one felony count and was hopelessly deadlocked on five others. The Justice Department quickly announced that it would not retry the case.  <paragraph>  CORRECTION (Tuesday 11:15 P.M.): The initial version of this post said Hickman is based in North Carolina. His polling firm is based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, just outside Washington D.C.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Nov. 2, 2:02 P.M.): Some, including the U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Deb Fischer in Nebraska, have seized on this post and Hickman’s testimony in the Edwards trial to suggest that Hickman deliberately skewed his firm’s polls for Edwards and may be doing something similar again in the current election cycle. This year, Hickman is polling for Fischer’s rival, former Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.).  <paragraph>  After Kerrey’s campaign released a poll Hickman took last month finding Kerrey within striking distance of Fischer,  <hyperlink> Roll Call reported that Fischer campaign spokesman Daniel Keylin said Hickman “admitted under oath that he cherry picked numbers to boost John Edwards’s struggling presidential campaign.” “It’s déjà vu all over again,” Keylin told the newspaper via e-mail.  <paragraph>  However, neither POLITICO’s post nor the transcript of Hickman’s court testimony linked to in the original post indicate that the pollster deliberately skewed any of the polls he did for Edwards or anyone else. At Edwards’s trial, prosecutors did not challenge the accuracy of the surveys Hickman conducted on behalf of the campaign.
U.S. names 55 Gitmo prisoners cleared to go |  <paragraph>  The U.S. Government has for the first time issued a public list of Guantanamo prisoners cleared for release or transfer, but who remain at the island prison because of difficulties finding a country willing to take them or because of concerns about sending them to their home countries.  <paragraph>  The list (posted   <hyperlink> here) was filed in a series of federal court cases Friday morning and includes the names and serial numbers of 55 detainees. That's almost exactly one-third of the 167 men currently imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  A significant number of the men are believed to be Yemeni.  <hyperlink> President Barack Obama suspended further transfers to Yemen in January 2010, stating that conditions in the country were too "unsettled" to ensure that detainees wouldn't return to or embark on terrorist activities.  <paragraph>  Since 2009, the U.S. Government has kept under wraps the list of detainees approved for release. In a court filing back then (posted   <hyperlink> here), the State Department's envoy for Guantanamo, Ambassador Daniel Fried, cited a need to coordinate diplomatic efforts to resettle the war-on-terror prisoners.  <paragraph>  However, in the new court filings Friday, Justice Department lawyers said that need no longer merited keeping the list secret. They didn't quite concede that the resettlement process has stalled, but that was the implication. Congress has also greatly complicated releases from Guantanamo with a series of legislative measures attached to budget bills that Obama signed into law.  <paragraph>  "In the over two years since the [Guantanamo Bay Review] Task Force completed its status reviews, circumstances have changed such that the decisions by the Task Force approving detainees for transfer no longer warrant protection," the DOJ lawyers wrote in their notice to the court (posted   <hyperlink> here).  <paragraph>  "The efforts of the United States to resettle Guantanamo detainees have largely been successful – they have resulted in 40 detainees being resettled in third countries because of treatment or other concerns in their countries of origin since 2009. In addition, 28 detainees have been repatriated to their countries of origin since 2009. Consequently, the diplomatic and national security harms identified [by Fried in a 2009 court filing] are no longer as acute. In Respondents’ view, there is no longer a need to withhold from the public the status of detainees who have been approved for transfer."  <paragraph>  It's unclear whether the list was ever officially classified, but it was designated as "protected" by the U.S. Government—a designation in Guantanamo cases that effectively keeps certain court records from the public.  <paragraph>  A note on the list indicates that more than 55 detainees may actually be cleared for release, but the status of any additional prisoners ordered released has been placed under seal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  <paragraph>  UPDATE: Two civil liberties groups have issued statements reacting to the list's disclosure. <paragraph>  "These men have been cleared for release for at least three years (longer in many cases), and yet they have been held at Guantanamo now for eleven years and counting. It's unconscionable that so few of these cleared men have been released by this administration over the last three years," said Shane Kadidal of the Center for Constitutional Rights.  "The list is clearly incomplete, and based on the total numbers seems to not include the Yemenis cleared for conditional release. Moreover, the government notes in its brief that for a number of cleared men it still needs to seek formal court approval to release their names. That should not be a problem but will take time, and people reading the list should know that some cleared men are not listed only because of this legal technicality."  <paragraph>  “Today’s release is a partial victory for transparency, and it should also be a spur to action,” said Zachary Katznelson of the American Civil Liberties Union. “These men have now spent three years in prison since our military and intelligence agencies all agreed they should be released. Not on the list, of course, is Adnan Latif, who died in his cell earlier this month despite having been repeatedly approved for release from Guantánamo. It is well past time to release and resettle these unfairly imprisoned men.” <paragraph>  CORRECTION (Friday, 9:21 P.M.): This post has been corrected to clarify the reasons Obama gave for suspending transfers to Yemen in 2010.
Lawsuit filed for withheld Fast and Furious documents |  <paragraph>  A conservative watchdog group has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to force disclosure of records that President Barack Obama has ordered withheld from the Congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious.  <paragraph>  Judicial Watch filed the suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington after a Freedom of Information Act request the group submitted in June was denied by the Justice Department. The agency has not acted on an administrative appeal the group filed last month, the complaint says.  <paragraph>  The FOIA suit opens up a second legal front in the effort to obtain the records, which pertain to the federal government's response to Congressional and media inquiries into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operation that allegedly allowed about 2,000 weapons to flow from legal U.S. gun dealers to Mexican drug cartels.  <paragraph>  Last month, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee   <hyperlink> filed its own lawsuit to obtain the records.  <paragraph>  A Justice Department spokesman had no comment on the new case. However, DOJ officials have noted in the past that the records in dispute don't relate directly to the ATF operation, but rather to how the executive branch responded to some of the fallout from it.  <paragraph>  It's unclear whether the Judicial Watch suit will offer a faster or surer path to disclosure of the records than the House action. The legal footing for the House lawsuit to enforce a subpoena against the executive branch is more uncertain than the routine FOIA case Judicial Watch has filed. However, executive branch agencies' right to withhold "deliberative" records in a FOIA case is fairly broad, while the privilege to resist a Congressional investigation may well be narrower.  <paragraph>  Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said Thursday that the group's suit could have some benefit even before or without any actual records becoming public.  <paragraph>  "Despite a contempt resolution being passed and the [House] litigation the administration’s refused to disclose exactly what they’re withholding and why," Fitton said in an interview. "We think a FOIA lawsuit is a simple, direct way to get a handle on what's being withheld and why and provides a good vehicle to challenge withholdings, if they are improper, as we suspect they are."
Judge: U.S. can't set limits on Guantanamo lawyers |  <paragraph>  Four years after a Democratic convention replete with criticism of then-President George W. Bush for illegally exceeding his executive powers in places like Guantanamo, President Barack Obama finds his administration the target of a tongue-lashing from a federal judge over its handling of lawyers' access to those same war-on-terror prisoners.  <paragraph>  On Thursday afternoon, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth handed a resounding victory to Guantanamo inmates and their attorneys, rejecting a bid by the Obama Administration to unilaterally set the rules under which those lawyers operate.  <paragraph>  In his sharply-worded decision, Lamberth was unsparing in his criticism of the government, blasting officials for "an illegitimate exercise of Executive power." <paragraph>  A few months ago, the military asserted that it could determine the visitation and communication rules for lawyers without consulting the courts with regard to detainees whose initial challenges to their detention have already been rejected. Justice Department attorneys defended the Pentagon's stance.  <paragraph>  But lawyers for the inmates noted that prisoners have the right to make new bids for freedom. The terror suspects' attorneys also said there was no reason to abrogate the court-ordered rules that have been in place for years.  <paragraph>  In the 32-page opinion (posted  <hyperlink> here), Lamberth unambiguously sided with the prisoners and their counsel.  <paragraph>  "In the case of Guantanamo detainees, access to the courts means nothing without access to counsel," wrote Lamberth, a Reagan appointee. "And it is undisputed that petitioners here have a continuing right to seek habeas relief. It follows that petitioners have an ongoing right to access the courts and, necessarily, to consult with counsel. Therefore, the Government's attempt to supersede the Court's authority is an illegitimate exercise of Executive power.  <paragraph>  "The Court, whose duty it is to secure an individual's liberty for unauthorized illegal Executive confinement, cannot now tell a prisoner that he must beg leave of the Executive's grace before the Court will involve itself. This very notion offends the separation of powers principles and our constitutional scheme," added Lamberth, who is serving at the moment as the chief judge in the district court in Washington.  <paragraph>  A Justice Department spokesman said government lawyers are reviewing the decision and "have no further comment at this time."  <paragraph>  Lamberth's initial ruling said that no prisoner at Guantanamo had ever been "fully tried or convicted of a crime." That's actually not true. In fact several have pled guilty before military commissions and one, Ahmed Ghailani, was flown to New York and convicted there after a trial. The judge later updated his opinion to say "only a handful have been tried or convicted."  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Friday, 3:45 A.M.): This post has been updated with the change to the judge's opinion.
