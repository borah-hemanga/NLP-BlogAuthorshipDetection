Lawsuit filed for withheld Fast and Furious documents |  <paragraph>  A conservative watchdog group has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to force disclosure of records that President Barack Obama has ordered withheld from the Congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious.  <paragraph>  Judicial Watch filed the suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington after a Freedom of Information Act request the group submitted in June was denied by the Justice Department. The agency has not acted on an administrative appeal the group filed last month, the complaint says.  <paragraph>  The FOIA suit opens up a second legal front in the effort to obtain the records, which pertain to the federal government's response to Congressional and media inquiries into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operation that allegedly allowed about 2,000 weapons to flow from legal U.S. gun dealers to Mexican drug cartels.  <paragraph>  Last month, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee   <hyperlink> filed its own lawsuit to obtain the records.  <paragraph>  A Justice Department spokesman had no comment on the new case. However, DOJ officials have noted in the past that the records in dispute don't relate directly to the ATF operation, but rather to how the executive branch responded to some of the fallout from it.  <paragraph>  It's unclear whether the Judicial Watch suit will offer a faster or surer path to disclosure of the records than the House action. The legal footing for the House lawsuit to enforce a subpoena against the executive branch is more uncertain than the routine FOIA case Judicial Watch has filed. However, executive branch agencies' right to withhold "deliberative" records in a FOIA case is fairly broad, while the privilege to resist a Congressional investigation may well be narrower.  <paragraph>  Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said Thursday that the group's suit could have some benefit even before or without any actual records becoming public.  <paragraph>  "Despite a contempt resolution being passed and the [House] litigation the administration’s refused to disclose exactly what they’re withholding and why," Fitton said in an interview. "We think a FOIA lawsuit is a simple, direct way to get a handle on what's being withheld and why and provides a good vehicle to challenge withholdings, if they are improper, as we suspect they are."
