Allen campaign, NRSC pulled DC radio buys | <paragraph>  George Allen's U.S. Senate campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee each recently canceled two weeks of radio ads across the D.C. metro area, according to documents obtained by POLITICO.  <paragraph>  Allen's campaign and the GOP committee said the cancellations were routine reallocations of advertising in the race to replace retiring Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.)  <paragraph>  "We were going up on TV around that time and we bought radio outside" the D.C. area instead, Dan Allen of the George Allen campaign said Tuesday.  <paragraph>  "It’s common for both parties to adjust reservations in the final weeks and to shift money between TV and radio. But we have long viewed Virginia as one of our top takeover opportunities, and the millions of dollars we are spending in this race reflects that," the NRSC's Brian Walsh said.  <paragraph>  Records obtained by POLITICO show that on Sept. 19, Allen's media buyers notified radio stations in the D.C. area of a "marketwide" cancellation of ads set to run from Sept. 25 to Oct. 8.  <paragraph>  And on Sept. 27, the NRSC's media buyers told radio stations that it was backing out of reservations in the D.C. market for Oct. 10 to Oct. 23.  <paragraph>  A Republican source said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee doesn’t currently have any radio ad time reserved in Virginia, but as of now the NRSC is still booked on the radio for the final three weeks of the campaign.  <paragraph>  However, Allen rival Tim Kaine's campaign has its own radio ad time booked from late August through November. The records reviewed by POLITICO did not show any Kaine cancellations of radio time on major D.C. stations during the period.
