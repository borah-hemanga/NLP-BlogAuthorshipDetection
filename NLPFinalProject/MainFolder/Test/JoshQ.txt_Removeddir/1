Cuomo: Storm victims can vote anywhere in New York |  <paragraph>  Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) announced Monday that New York residents displaced by Hurricane Sandy can cast ballots anywhere in the state.  <paragraph>  "We want everyone to vote. Just because people are displaced doesn't mean they should be disenfranchised," Cuomo said at a news conference, according to the Asssociated Press.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> On Twitter, Cuomo indicated that permission to vote "by affidavit" had been granted to residents of Rockland and Westchester counties, Long Island and New York City.  <paragraph>  Civil rights and voting rights groups had urged Cuomo to issue such an order, much as N.J. Gov. Chris Christie's administration did on Saturday.  <paragraph>  Cuomo said all voters will be able to cast ballots for president and U.S. Senate, but only those voters who go to a precinct in their home district will be able to vote for state Senate, assembly and local offices.  <paragraph>  "You can't vote for what we call down-ballot individuals," Cuomo said. "Your vote will not be eligible."
