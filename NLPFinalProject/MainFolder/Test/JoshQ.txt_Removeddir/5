Did Obama back bans on hate speech? |  <paragraph>  A report Monday on The Daily Caller website argues that when President Barack Obama was a student at Harvard Law School he endorsed the idea of restricting speech in order to protect minorities.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> The report is a bit short, though, on specifics to back up its conclusion. It hangs largely on a 13-word quote from a panel discussion in which Obama said: "I don’t see a lot of conservatives getting upset if minorities feel silenced." The Caller also cites the recollection of a participant in the panel discussion, Brian Timmons, that all the six panelists except him "promoted the same view." However, Timmons is not quoted offering any specific recollection of what the future president said during the discussion, which included future Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.  <paragraph>  A close reading of the underlying source material, a write-up in the Harvard Law School yearbook, suggests the panel discussed a variety of different subjects ranging from whether an atmosphere of political correctness was unwisely limiting the number of views on campus to whether rules or laws should be imposed to protect minorities from offensive speech. (One of the earliest forays in this battle, a University of Michigan code banning racist or sexist speech, was struck down by a federal court in 1989.)  <paragraph>  Frankly, it wouldn't be surprising if Obama sided with those less supportive of free speech in the campus battles of the 1980s and early 1990s. Many prominent scholars on the left seemed enamored by that position in that era, including  <hyperlink> another future Supreme Court justice, Elena Kagan. The issue split groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, though the pro-free-speech forces ultimately carried the day. <paragraph>  However, the Caller's evidence stops short of putting Obama firmly in the speech-restricting camp. The direct quote reads like a rebuttal to someone else's argument, not a direct endorsement of a particular position or policy. And, of course, it was more than 20 years ago, while he was a student, so not the greatest evidence of his current views.  <paragraph>  Still, it's an interesting data point, especially at a time when the question of offensive speech is in the news as a result of the violence in the Muslim world directed at an anti-Muslim video produced in the U.S.  <paragraph>  Obama didn't offer a vocal defense of free speech principles in his first public comments on the video, though later that same day he said in an interview: "We believe in the First Amendment. It is one of the hallmarks of our Constitution that I’m sworn to uphold.  And so we are always going to uphold the rights for individuals to speak their mind. On the other hand, this film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that."  <paragraph>  Obama also presented  <hyperlink> a vigorous defense of free speech principles at the United Nations last month.
