Why Romney's Dixie drought could doom the GOP |  <paragraph>   Many are discounting Rick Santorum's big win in Louisiana last night as too little too late. Perhaps they should take a second look.  <paragraph>   The former Pennsylvania senator almost beat the front-runner by a two-to-one margin, reeling in almost 50 percent of the vote in a four-person race. More important to Republicans who want to win the White House this fall is the continued weakness Massachusetts' Mitt Romney is showing in the South.   <paragraph>   Romney's performance south of the Mason-Dixon line has been pathetic. Despite having all the money, organization and endorsements that matter, Romney finished third in Alabama, third in Mississippi and a distant second in Louisiana. He was stomped by Newt Gingrich by an average of 20 points in South Carolina and Georgia and had his 13 worst performances in 2008 in the Deep South.  <paragraph>   There was a time when the South was solidly Republican but those days are gone. Barack Obama won Virginia and North Carolina four years ago and came close to beating John McCain in Georgia. Bill Clinton beat George Bush in Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia.  <paragraph>   Romney's continued weakness in the Heart of Dixie spells trouble for the GOP this fall. The only question is whether it will take a Santorum win in Wisconsin to refocus Republican minds on the unassailable fact that GOP presidential candidates cannot win unless they have the support of rock-ribbed conservatives. Mitt Romney does not, and that is becoming clearer by the day in this painful primary season.
