 270 to win |   <paragraph>  Mark Halperin and I looked over the electoral map this morning during a commercial break and were surprised by how quickly our view of the political landscape has changed over the past few weeks. With the economy flatlining and the president's declaration on gay marriage sparking controversy across the South, much has changed politically since the beginning of May.  <paragraph>  According to both campaigns, the swing states most impacted by gay marriage will be Florida, North Carolina, Iowa and Ohio. Most insiders believe that Florida and North Carolina are swinging Mitt Romney's way and now seem to be uphill climbs for the president. Ohio will be impacted by gay marriage on election day, but to a lesser degree than Southern states. Still, that issue (along with the possible selection of Ohio Senator Rob Portman as Romney's running mate) could tip the Buckeye State state back into the Republican column once again.  <paragraph>  Which leads to Mr. Halperin's and my surprising takeaway this morning.  <paragraph>  If Mitt Romney is able to steal Florida, Ohio and North Carolina from Team Obama, the two key swing states this November will turn out to be the unlikely pair of Virginia and Colorado. Even though the last two cycles have made it seem like Florida and Ohio would be the swing states that mattered most for years to come, it now looks like we will all be focused on "Virginia, Virginia, Virginia" late into the night on November 6th.  <paragraph>  This could, of course, all change if it is a Romney surrogate who goes on a Sunday morning show and veers wildly off message by calling everyone who ever worked for Bain Capital "a bunch of greedy bastards." But don't expect that to happen. But do expect a campaign that may focus less on Florida and Ohio than states like Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire and Nevada. These states that were second-tier swing states not so long ago now seem poised to help decide who sits in the Oval Office over the next four years.
