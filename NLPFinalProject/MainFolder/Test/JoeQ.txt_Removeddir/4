Making love out of nothing at all |  <paragraph>  The response to President Obama's same-sex marriage statement yesterday was fascinating on many fronts. Most entertaining was the reaction of the president's cheering section in the mainstream media.  <paragraph>  Who knew the New York Times could be such champions of states' rights?  <paragraph>  In fact, I think it is safe to say that this many Democrats haven't been as supportive of 10th Amendment federalism since Lester Maddox and George Wallace controlled Southern states during the days of segregation.  <paragraph>  The best laugh-out-loud moment came when the Times sent out a breathless breaking news alert at 3:16 pm, crammed with shameless spin and naked cheerleading. Public Editor Arthur Brisbane take note that the Newspaper of Record recorded the moment this way:  <paragraph>  "President Obama declared for the first time that he supports same-sex marriage, putting the moral power of his presidency behind a social issue that continues to divide the country."  <paragraph>  The moral power of his presidency? Really?  <paragraph>  Exactly how did the New York Times come to that conclusion when Barack Obama said he would not use his power as president to stop others from banning gay marriage?  <paragraph>  Did any member of the Times newsroom actually believe that the president was ever personally against same-sex marriage? Where was the editor who approved that language over the past decade?  <paragraph>  Do these progressive cheerleaders of the president realize that their hero has now adopted a position on gay marriage that is horrifyingly close to the views of Ron Paul, Barry Goldwater, William F. Buckley, Ronald Reagan and yes, even me.  <paragraph>  If not, they should.  <paragraph>  Since I believe that most social issues should be handled on the state level, Barack Obama's declaration was like Morning in America all over again!  <paragraph>  But the impact of Obama's statement may not be so positive in the long run for America's top newspapers and networks. They continue to be enablers of a liberal politician who has long played a cynical game on an issue critical to most who run those same media outlets.  <paragraph>  Is a Democratic victory in November really that important to these journalists or are they just blinded by love? The only thing that the statement by the president proved is that those same news organizations are now defending a position on gay marriage that would make Bill Buckley proud.
