Doubts about Akin's cause | <paragraph>   Todd Akin says he's staying in the race because "there is a cause here."    <paragraph>   Perhaps he is right. Perhaps there is a cause worth risking a Republican Senate, that is worth risking two more years with Harry Reid as Majority Leader, that is worth damaging the Republican brand and is worth casting a dark shadow over Mitt Romney's convention next week.    <paragraph>   But if there is a cause worthy of losing the U.S. Senate and damaging Romney and Ryan's chances against Barack Obama, I sure don't see it.  <paragraph>   I look forward to Congressman Akin's explanation.
