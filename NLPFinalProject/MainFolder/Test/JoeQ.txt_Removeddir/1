Beware of summertime subpoenas | <paragraph> If it's summer, it must be time for a scandal. Or at least summertime in Washington has long seemed a season for faux high-drama, with committee chairmen all looking for their Sam Ervin moment. <paragraph> Here's a reality check: There's a reason Sam Ervin was Sam Ervin; He had Watergate. <paragraph> The latest entrant in the scandal sweepstakes is the "Fast and Furious" showdown, with GOP Chairman Darrell Issa battling Attorney General Eric Holder. For the ideologically uninitiated, "Fast and Furious" was a bungled ATF operation that funneled guns to Mexican cartels. By the time the dust settled, a U.S. agent was dead. <paragraph> Chairman Issa and Republican leaders are right to want answers. They know that an embarrassed White House wants to keep damning facts away from the press during an election year. And now Mr. Issa wants to find Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over those documents. <paragraph> There are real issues about executive power at stake, and even the dead agent's family want President Barack Obama to be more forthcoming about the operation.  But Congressman Issa should beware the political siren song of headlines and cable crawls. Americans care about jobs, and the image of flying subpoenas and internal fighting are more likely to turn off key independent voters than they are to bring Justice to justice. <paragraph> As a surviving member of the GOP Congress who subpoenaed Bill Clinton's White House for the better part of eight years, I know firsthand that what makes for good partisan headlines can also make for bad election-year politics.
