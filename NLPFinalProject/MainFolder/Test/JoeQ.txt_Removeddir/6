Sliming the Supreme Court |   <paragraph>  I love Bobby Knight. The former Indiana basketball coaching legend used to run up and down the sidelines screaming at shrinking referees in hopes of having the next call go his way.  <paragraph>  The New York Times' editorial page is now doing their best Bobby Knight imitation in covering the Supreme Court in a way that matches the former Hoosier's red-faced rage insult by insult.  <paragraph>  In this case, the intended target is Justice Anthony Kennedy instead of a poor, shriveled-up referee. The Times knows that with the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Kennedy is the only member left on the Court who can be swayed by such non-germane items as New York Times editorials.  <paragraph>  Understanding the breadth of their power, the editorial page editors decided to use their Sunday space  <hyperlink>  to personally attack any Supreme Court justice who had the temerity to raise questions during last week's oral arguments. Those who did were blasted by the editorial page as "sidestepping the Constitution" and being "virtually unfettered by the law."  <paragraph>  In the same editorial, the Times labeled the four liberal justices as "moderates" who "see their role as stewards of the law, balancing the responsibility to enforce the Constitution through judicial review against the duty to show deference to the will of the political branches."  <paragraph>  Excuse me for a moment while I go throw up… OK. I'm back.  <paragraph>  The Times’ description of the "moderates" is laughable at best.  <paragraph>  Their voting patterns are every bit as predictably liberal as Scalia, Thomas, Roberts and Alito line up as a conservative block.  In this particular case, the Times’ description of the Court's left wing voting block is particularly hilarious considering that one of those impartial "stewards of the law" was sending euphoric emails to liberal law professor Larry Tribe during the passage of the very law that she will now judge.  <paragraph>  Maureen Dowd went Full-Bobby with   <hyperlink>  her rant against the Court, attacking them as "hacks" who are "cosseted behind white marble pillars." Dowd goes on to say, the Court is "out of reach of TV,” "accountable to no one" and "the most divisive in modern American history." <paragraph>  Maureen slimed Justice Scalia as "venomous," called Chief Justice Roberts "a crimson partisan" and dismissed Justice Alito as being "insufferable."  <paragraph>  But then Coach Dowd clumsily showed her hand when she ended the column by declaring that the "dream of expanded health care" was now resting in the hands of Anthony Kennedy.  <paragraph>  Will Justice Kennedy be influenced by the all-too-obvious gamesmanship of the Times editorial page? I doubt it. I'm fairly sure the Times (and the president) overplayed their hands and somehow succeeded in making the justices look sympathetic.  <paragraph>  As the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger wrote today, “Most legal commentary has said the president's attack is likely to anger the justices, perhaps including some of the Court's liberals."  <paragraph>  I suspect Henninger is right. Even Bobby Knight knew that spewing personal insults and throwing chairs at refs backfires more often than not.
