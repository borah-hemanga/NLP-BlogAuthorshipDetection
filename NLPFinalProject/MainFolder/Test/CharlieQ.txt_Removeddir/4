A GOP wipeout in New England |  <paragraph>  The New England wing of the House GOP, after showing brief signs of life, is extinct again.  <paragraph>  Democrats cleaned out the region on Tuesday, knocking off New Hampshire GOP Reps Charlie Bass and Frank Giunta and fending off stiff challenges to Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney and Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline. Republicans also lost a toss-up open seat race in Connecticut.  <paragraph>  The GOP didn’t fare much better in New England’s Senate races either. Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown lost his seat, Independent Angus King captured retiring Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe’s seat, and Linda McMahon spent more than $40 million in a losing bid for Connecticut’s open Senate seat. In Vermont, meanwhile, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders demolished his GOP foe in a 71-25 landslide while Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse won 65-35.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink>  Also on POLITICO: Republicans keep control of House)  <paragraph>  New England was without Republican representation in the House for two years after the 2008 defeat of Connecticut Rep. Chris Shays but the election of Bass and Giunta in 2010, along with GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, suggested the GOP still had a pulse.
