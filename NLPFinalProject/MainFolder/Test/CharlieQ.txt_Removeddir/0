House Dems dominated by 4 states |   <paragraph>  The University of Minnesota’s  <hyperlink>  Smart Politics blog looks at the composition of the 113th Congress and reports that the House Democratic Caucus will be dominated by two big blue states:  <paragraph>  " Californians and New Yorkers will comprise a record percentage of the Democratic caucus when the 113th Congress convenes in January at nearly 30 percent.  <paragraph>  Although gains by Democrats were modest in 2012 U.S. House races — netting eight seats nationwide — the delegations from two coastal states still managed to increase their ever-growing influence on the party.  <paragraph>  For despite the State of New York losing two seats due to reapportionment after the 2010 U.S. Census, the Democratic Party saw the percentage of its caucus from the Empire State and California delegations increase to an all-time high — now just shy of 30 percent of the 201 seats it will hold across the country in January.  <paragraph>  A Smart Politics analysis of 83 general election cycles dating back to 1850 finds that the Democratic Party now composes a larger percentage of Californians and New Yorkers in the U.S. House than at any point since California joined the Union."  <paragraph>  If you add in Illinois and Massachusetts, then 40 percent of the Democratic Caucus hails from just four blue states.  <paragraph>  There’s a danger, of course, when such a high proportion of members hail from just a few states. As the GOP is learning from its overreliance on the South, it’s easy to develop a tin ear when a party is too concentrated in states where the political climate is unrepresentative of the nation as a whole.
