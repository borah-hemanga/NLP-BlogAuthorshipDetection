An early abortion rights test for Dems |   <paragraph>  The Democratic Party’s full and unyielding embrace of abortion rights in 2012 – a subtle but conspicuous repositioning – is about to be tested in a contest for the top Democratic slot on the powerful Appropriations Committee between Reps. Nita Lowey and Marcy Kaptur.  <paragraph>  From a report Sunday in  <hyperlink>  The Hill: “ A key factor in the race is abortion. Lowey’s camp argues she is more reliable in preventing anti-abortion rights legislation from being inserted into appropriations bills. Kaptur’s camp notes she has opposed riders defunding Planned Parenthood. Lowey, her office acknowledges, is emphasizing her pro-abortion rights positions. According to NARAL, Lowey has a 100 percent ranking on abortion-related issues, while Kaptur is “mixed-choice” at 70 percent. ”  <paragraph>  While support for abortion rights isn’t the only issue at play in the competition for the ranking Democratic position on the spending panel, the debate provides a window into the priorities and current thinking in the caucus.  <paragraph>  When Republicans chose a new chairman after the 2010 election, the battle lines were drawn over pork-barreling practices and appropriations reform.
