Hannity's immigration evolution draws praise from conservative Latino group | Sean Hannity’s announcement that he has “evolved” on immigration is drawing praise from a conservative Latino organization. <paragraph> Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, on Friday applauded Hannity for telling his radio listeners he now supports a pathway to citizenship for those in the United States without criminal records. <paragraph> “Sean Hannity has taken a bold step and conservatives are behind him. It is time to allow the market — rather than a bureaucratic federal government — to determine our immigration policy,”  <hyperlink> Aguilar said, according to a press release. <paragraph> “The tidal wave of support for real reform is growing,”  <hyperlink> Aguilar said. <paragraph> “There is a growing momentum within the conservative movement to embrace a market-based immigration plan that is in line with Ronald Reagan, who said it best:  ‘No regulation or law should be allowed if it results in crops rotting in the fields for lack of harvesters,’”  <hyperlink> Aguilar noted. <paragraph> In the wake of the GOP's failure to attract the Latino vote in the 2012 election, Hannity on Thursday said the United States needs to “get rid of the immigration issue altogether.”  <hyperlink> <paragraph> “I think you control the border first,"  <hyperlink> he said. "You create a pathway for those people that are here — you don’t say you’ve got to go home. And that is a position that I’ve evolved on. Because, you know what, it’s got to be resolved."
Tina Brown: 'The Zeitgeist was against Newsweek' | When Tina Brown looks back on her decision to take over Newsweek, “it just seems completely insane, actually,” she told New York Magazine. <paragraph> In a wide-ranging interview appearing in the Nov. 26 issue  <hyperlink> ,  Brown spoke about everything from the future of newsweeklies to who she supported in the 2012 election — “you know who I voted for” — to her friendship with The Huffington Post’s Arianna Huffington — “we shared some of the same boyfriends.” As for her start at Newsweek, Brown told Michael Kinsley she felt it was a “romantic gamble that there was still life to be had for” the newsweekly.  <paragraph> “We felt that for the Daily Beast—such a frisky digital brand—to have a print platform as well would be great,” the ex-Vanity Fair, ex-New Yorker, ex-Talk editor said. “And, actually, that proved to be true. But every piece of the Zeitgeist was against Newsweek, combined with an unfixable infrastructure and a set of challenges that really would have required five years in an up economy to solve.” <paragraph>  And the future is a metered-access model, she said, with Newsweek charging readers for every fourth or fifth piece. Other magazines will soon follow Newsweek and move online, Brown, who announced in October that Newsweek would cease publishing  <hyperlink> at the end of this year and move to an all-digital format, predicted.  <paragraph>  “I think a lot of magazines are going to have to go online. There will be magazines, but a lot of magazines are going to decide that with basic, inherent costs, the fact that advertisers want to now be in digital, combined with the reading habits of all of us—they’ll decide that print doesn’t make any sense,” Brown said. <paragraph> And her decision to take on Newsweek "just seems completely insane" to her now, she said. <paragraph> “Within the first few months, one of the partners dies—before we’d even really gotten the office straight. I came into a situation where pretty much every senior member of management had departed,” she noted. <paragraph> Not to mention that the magazine cost $42 million to print even before any staff salaries, she said. <paragraph> “That was the thing,” Brown said. “We just looked at it in the spring, and everything, every trend, suggested this was never going to change. It’s not like you felt it was a temporary advertising situation.” And while she had envisioned that Newsweek could take after European newsmagazines with their “energetic, high-low approach to news,” Newsweek’s poor advertising sales made that impossible, Brown said. "There’s something about the way a magazine looks and feels when it doesn’t have advertising that is unbelievably disappointing, both as an editor and as a writer,” she said. <paragraph> Brown also reflected on the very different world of Newsweek in its heyday — “when I looked at the document of sale, it was like the vestiges of the great galleon it had been. It was like that wreck of the Titanic, in the James Cameron film” — but said the magazine still has a “great deal of access and power.” <paragraph> “And I think we’ve done a very good magazine,” she told Kinsley. “I don’t know whether you’ve been reading it—probably not—but it’s very good. There was a lot of talent here. But it’s like having a refrigerator on each foot—to have this carapace of the print magazine and all its problems, and all its legacy of unsolved issues. Once we shed that, we’ll just be able to focus on the content. I find that very liberating, personally. I think many of the staff do, too.” <paragraph> In the interview, Brown also defended herself against various accusations Kinsley posed — that she only cares about “buzz,” hasn’t made money for any of the publications she has run and that her only role is paying lots of money to big-name writers. <paragraph> Kinsley also offered an “observation” that “Tina has a thing for older men. And older men have a thing for Tina.” “Do you feel you have a special connection with older men?” he asked. <paragraph> “I certainly feel I have a special connection with the one I’m married to,” she said, as Kinsley jumped in to press her again on his “observation.” <paragraph> “You go to war with the army you have,” Brown replied. “Please. Let’s not talk about me having things for Si Newhouse and Harvey Weinstein. I enjoyed working for both of them, even Harvey.” <paragraph> The interview ended with a look four years into the future, to the 2016 election: Brown said she’d throw her full support behind Hillary Clinton. <paragraph> “Citizen Tina—thanks for that—would hike across America for Hillary. I’ve seen her up close in action in our Women in the World events, and she’s so unbelievably compelling. I want her to get her two years off, cut her hair again, freshen up those old pantsuits, and hit the trail running,” Brown said.   
Huckabee to pundits: Put up or shut up | Mike Huckabee on Thursday laid out a challenge to the pundits who are now criticizing Mitt Romney’s campaign: “If you’re so doggone good at this, when will we see your name on the ballot?”  <paragraph> “I’m just so tired of the people who have never actually gotten in the game of politics trying to figure out what went wrong,” he said on “The Mike Huckabee Show” Thursday afternoon. “And I’m going to challenge, if you're one of those people — you may even be a host of a radio show — if you're so doggone good at this, when will we see your name on the ballot? I’m just curious if you’ll let me know, because I want to sit back and watch to see how it ought to be done.”  <paragraph>  For those that have never been in the political arena to think they understand how to run a campaign, Huckabee said, just shows the “level of ignorance” among political pundits. <paragraph> “So I say come out of the stands, put your jacket aside where it’s nice and warm, get down on the field, take a few hits upside the head, come off the field with your own blood pouring out of your body, several of your bones broken, and tell me what a great, great genius approach you had to the whole process,” Huckabee said. <paragraph> The former Arkansas governor also reflected on his own political career, noting that each time someone offered him advice on how to win, he felt tempted to respond sarcastically. <paragraph> “No, I really don’t want to win, because then you have to work and you have a job to do,” Huckabee said he would want to tell his critics. “I just want to run to run because it’s so much fun coming out here, getting up at four in the morning every morning and running until well past midnight, living off hot cokes and cold pizza, eating every meal you have for two years out of a paper sack while on the way to yet another campaign event. So, no, I really don’t want to win the election, I just enjoy this extraordinary process of having the tar beaten out of me by newspapers, editorial cartoonists, by opponents and their negative ads.” <paragraph> 
Al Gore: Voter suppression like 'racist Jim Crow tactics' | Al Gore said Tuesday on Current TV that the attempt this cycle to stop people from voting has been "un-American" and a "disgrace," adding that it is a “strategy that is a direct descendent" of "racist Jim Crow tactics.” <paragraph> Gore, who co-founded the left-leaning cable channel, said he hopes there will be a "reckoning for these governors and state legistures that have intentionally tried to prevent people from voting. It is un-American." The problem — which he said included the long lines facing many voters, particularly in Florida — must be addressed in a bipartisan way after the election. <paragraph> “It is a strategy that is a direct descendent of the racist Jim Crow tactics that were used in the wake of the Civil War to prevent black people from voting. It’s more sophisticated now, it’s dressed up in different kinds of language, but it is un-American,” he said. “It is wrong. It is a disgrace to this country. And there ought to be a bipartisan movement to say, enough of this. We have the ability to let everyone who is eligible to vote without standing in line for eight hours, without having their names stricken wrongly from the voting rolls. And this is something that ought to be a bipartisan agenda after this election.” 
Fox News obsessed with lone Black Panther | On the most important day in American politics, one of Fox News’s biggest stories has been about a lone New Black Panther Party member standing outside a Philadelphia polling place. <paragraph> Fox News has featured several segments today on Jerry Jackson, who was charged in 2008 for voter intimidation, although the charges against him were later dropped. Jackson was spotted outside a Philadelphia polling place Tuesday morning, and Fox News confirmed <hyperlink>  Jackson is a designated poll watcher. <paragraph> Fox News's "Fox & Friends" kicked off the coverage of the New Black Panther Party today at 8 a.m. with an interview with Get Out The Vet's Ben Brink about how Navy SEALs and other veterans will "fight back" against such voter intimidation from the New Black Panther Party. About 10 minutes later, Fox News's Gretchen Carlson introduced video of the man standing outside the polling place. <paragraph> "This is a member of the Black Panthers standing guard outside a polling place in Philadelphia. Does it look reminiscent? Remember this from four years ago? The organization said it was thinking about monitoring the election. Critics say it's more like intimidation. The Black Panthers also stood guard at polling places in 2008 in Philly, the group's leader with a night stick in his hand. It looks very similar," she said. <paragraph> On "Fox & Friends," conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and Fox News legal analyst Peter J. Johnson, Jr. also discussed the New Black Panther Party member. <paragraph> During "America's Newsroom," Fox News’s Martha MacCallum played some “new video” of the New Black Panther Party member “standing guard outside a polling place opening doors as voters come through there to place their votes” and noted that a Fox News reporter tried to ask him about his role there. <paragraph> “We got only a ‘no comment’ from this gentleman,” MacCallum said. “You may recall a big story that unfolded, this is the tape back from 2008. The New Black Panther Party members were accused of voter intimidation in Philadelphia back then. One of them was seen holding a billy club outside of that polling place. So what does this mean this morning?” <paragraph> MacCallum then held a discussion on the topic with Fox News contributors Bill Kristol and Deroy Murdock. Later on, Fox News also conducted an interview with the Rev. Jesse Jackson about the New Black Panther Party member. <paragraph> 
Media: Obama in fighting mood | Top journalists and pundits reviewing the debate said Monday night it was clear President Barack Obama had come to the final faceoff spoiling for a fight with Mitt Romney, while the Republican nominee sought to fend off the attacks and maintain his momentum. <paragraph> “I thought in the middle of the debate that if I had been on the desert island for the last four years and I had just been parachuted into this debate, I would have thought the guy that had turned out to be Mitt Romney was the president protecting a lead and that Barack Obama was the challenger trying, somewhat desperately to catch up,” Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace said. “Obama was slashing, was personal, was cutting.” <paragraph>  His Fox News colleague Brit Hume agreed, saying that Obama had a “very intent look on his face” like a “man looking for opportunities to strike.” <paragraph> On CNN, Candy Crowley, the moderator of the second presidential debate, said the candidates had two very different objectives tonight: Obama came to “rough up” Romney, while the Republican was seeking to preserve his new-found momentum. <paragraph>  “I think the president came to rough up Mitt Romney,” Crowley said. “I think he acted like a person that had to sort of stop some momentum by Romney. He went after him — ‘you’re all over the map, that’s not what you said before’ — I mean, almost every single answer from the president had something to do with Mitt Romney. I feel as though Mitt Romney approached this like a physician, first do no harm. I feel like he didn’t come in to necessarily win. I think he came in, you know, as a man who’s had a certain amount of momentum over the past three, four weeks since that first debate and not wanting to ruin it.” <paragraph>  NBC’s David Gregory also described the debate in terms of the president angling for a battle. The president was “determined to pick a fight” with Romney, who was “surprisingly, determined to avoid a fight, playing almost as if he was ahead, determined to sound more moderate, to disagree less with the president on foreign policy,” said the “Meet the Press” host. <paragraph> CNN’s Wolf Blitzer noted that except for a few “rhetorical flourishes,” there wasn’t much difference between the two candidates on foreign policy, he said. <paragraph> “This was a debate where they wound up agreeing, even though there were nuances of disagreement, they wound up basically in terms of the big picture agreeing on a lot, on Iran, on Israel, on Afghanistan Libya, Syria, even on China, basically the thrust was one of agreement, even though at times they had little rhetorical flourishes against each other,” Blitzer said. <paragraph> The Atlantic’s James Fallows also pointed out the similarities between the two candidates on foreign policy, writing that “it was more striking as a matter of substance that on virtually no issue did Romney make an actual criticism, of any sort, of Obama’s policy or record. Including topics where he used to disagree, like the timeline for withdrawal for Afghanistan! Instead it was, ‘I agree, but you should have done it better.’” <paragraph>  Meanwhile MSNBC’s Chris Matthews said Romney “had a strategy tonight — avoiding looking like a radical.” <paragraph> “Avoiding the statements he’s made throughout the primaries and caucuses that put him on the far right, in terms of looking a bit dangerous. He pulled back, pulled back, pulled back,” the “Hardball” host said. <paragraph> And his MSNBC colleague Ed Schultz called the debate a win for Obama and blasted Romney as giving the “worst performance of any Republican candidate on foreign policy that I can ever remember.”   
N.Y. Times covers CEO's role in BBC sex abuse scandal | The New York Times is up with a new story on Mark Thompson, the embattled former BBC head and incoming president and CEO of The New York Times Co. <paragraph> The article — "British Parliament Questions Former BBC Chief’s Role <hyperlink> "  — details the shift in public statements from Thompson regarding what and when he knew about the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse investigation. The Times, which sat down with the former BBC director general on Tuesday, also featured another interview in Wednesday's piece about his knowledge of the spiked ”Newsnight” program.  “At no point does either Caroline [Hawley, the journalist who told him of the investigation in 2011] or the senior news managers ever specify exactly what is in the ‘Newsnight,’ what lines of inquiry they’re adopting or what was alleged,” he told the Times. “There was no detail given at all. Neither before that period or after that period did anyone raise complaints. I knew about its existence. But I was told, however, the program decided to stop it.” <paragraph> "I was not given any detail of what the program had been investigating," he added. <paragraph> Thompson also noted that “I can’t remember one where I was notified or briefed. There wasn’t a single example of ‘Newsnight’ referring programs that they got so high that they were referred to the director general.” <paragraph> The article mentioned the parliamentary hearing Tuesday that "featured an uncomfortable and apologetic George Entwistle, the current director general" and detailed the letters sent from members regarding Thompson's role, including one from former BBC producer Roger Gale that said Thompson was paid “to, apparently, not know what was going on under his own roof.”  <paragraph> As for whether Thompson will testify, John Whittingdale, the chairman of the parliamentary committee that held the hearing told the Times, "At the moment, we’re told he had no knowledge of the ‘Newsnight’ investigation. If reasons arise to talk to him, we will do so."  
Sulzberger: BBC scandal 'hasn’t made things easy' | New York Times Co. chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said chief executive Mark Thompson's connection to the BBC's Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal "hasn’t made things easy," according to a report. <paragraph> “The British stuff hasn’t made things easy,” Sulzberger told Bloomberg News <hyperlink> on Tuesday night. “But Mark is a good man.” <paragraph>  Thompson, who is facing questions over his role at the BBC concerning the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal <hyperlink> , started his new gig at the Times on Nov. 12. Sulzberger, who did not elaborate on the "British stuff," added that he was pleased to finally have the CEO position filled, Bloomberg News reported. “We are very happy to have him in the position after all that time,” he said. <paragraph>  Controversy continues to swirl around Thompson, formerly BBC director general, who has said he was not involved <hyperlink>  in killing the BBC “Newsnight” investigation into Savile. He has said he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being spiked, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011.  
Newspaper disciplines copy editor for adding 'allegedly' to 'Obama was born in Hawaii' | The Montana Independent Record disciplined a copy editor for changing a line in an Associated Press story to read "Obama was allegedly born in Hawaii." <paragraph>  The change appeared in the Sunday edition of the Helena newspaper in an AP story about President Barack Obama's visit to Asia. The line in the Independent Record read: “The Asia trip underscores Obama’s efforts to establish the United states as an Asia-Pacific power, a worldview defined by 21st century geopolitics but also by Obama’s personal identity as America’s first Pacific president. Obama was allegedly born in Hawaii.” <paragraph>  Retired AP staffer Tom Laceky, who worked in the Helena bureau for 28 years, pointed out the addition of "allegedly" in a letter to the editor on Tuesday  <hyperlink> . <paragraph>  "'Allegedly born in Hawaii?' As if there is any doubt? That right-wing notion has been so thoroughly discredited that only Donald Trump and assorted other loonies still cling to it. Neither the AP nor -I hope - The Independent Record belongs in their company," Laceky wrote. <paragraph> Another reader also wrote in <hyperlink>  to share their disappointment with the edit of the AP piece. <paragraph> In an editor's note <hyperlink> , the newspaper wrote that it was a "poor attempt at humor and a poor decision" and that "those responsible have been disciplined":    
Mitchell: Men at MSNBC make more money | <video> <paragraph> During an interview Thursday, Mitt Romney senior adviser Barbara Comstock told Andrea Mitchell <hyperlink> that “we know here at MSNBC the guys get paid more" — and the MSNBC host replied, “We certainly do.” <paragraph> Mitchell and Comstock were discussing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act <hyperlink> on “Andrea Mitchell Reports” when the Romney adviser said MSNBC has issues with fair pay for men and women. “I mean for Lilly Ledbetter, this was not just a legal issue,” Mitchell said. “This was the fact that she was not permitted to sue for equal pay because the statute had ran out and the law said if you didn't know the men you were working with were making more money, which many of us don't know, we don't have access to those confidential —“ <paragraph>  (Also on POLITICO: Equal pay surfaces in debate) <hyperlink>  “We know here at MSNBC the guys get paid more,” Comstock jumped in, laughing. “We know that.” <paragraph>   “We certainly do,” Mitchell replied. <paragraph>  “So this is one of the places where you need to be a little bit more public with it,” Comstock said. <paragraph>  As the interview wrapped, Comstock again brought up the issue of fair pay at MSNBC. <paragraph>  “You get after MSNBC here, Andrea,” Comstock said. “Make sure the women make the same here.” <paragraph>  “Thank you very much,” Mitchell replied. <paragraph> UPDATE: (4:03 p.m.): Andrea Mitchell tells POLITICO, “I was referring to the industry as a whole. This remark has been taken out of context.” <paragraph>  MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski adds, "We take this issue very seriously and I can tell you that we're proud of the gender equality at MSNBC."  
TiVo: '47 percent' exchange most-watched | The most-watched moment of Thursday’s vice presidential debate was the exchange between Vice President Joe Biden and Paul Ryan over Mitt Romney’s “47 percent” remarks, according to a report on Friday.  <paragraph> The first presidential showdown was noticeably missing any mention of the “47 percent” comments, but the remarks delivered the vice presidential debate’s most-watched moment, TiVo found in an analysis of viewership data across all broadcast and cable networks. Biden brought up the comments within the first half-hour of the debate — at 9:28 p.m. EST — when he talked about Romney’s economic policies and said “it shouldn't be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of the American people are unwilling to take responsibility of their own lives.” The exchange with Ryan over those comments marked the top moment across all networks, TiVo found. <paragraph>  The second most-watched moment came just a few minutes later, at 9:33 p.m., with Biden responding to Ryan over the congressman’s requests for stimulus funds. "Any letter you send me, I'll entertain,” Biden said. Ryan replied, “I appreciate that, Joe.” <paragraph>  TiVo Research and Analytics Inc. uses anonymous viewing data and “gauges the interest in programming content by measuring the most rewound and re-watched moments in the debate.”
