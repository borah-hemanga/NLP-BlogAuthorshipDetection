Harry Malkin: From Pit to Paintbrush | <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CASTLEFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE—The two elderly women dressed in their Sunday best talked about the “human chain” as if they had seen it yesterday, though it was decades ago. It came about after a man had gotten stuck in a tiny space in one of the underground coal mines that used to be the social and economic foundation of these communities. Eileen Sparks’s father-in-law was among the five rescuers who formed the human chain and lowered themselves into the space, finally pulling the man free at the end of a three-day rescue. <PARAGRAPH> “He came out just like a cork!” Sparks recalls. “And they weren’t paid for those three days, because the mine where the rescue was said ‘You’re not on our books,’ and the mine where they worked said ‘Well you weren’t working here.’ ” <PARAGRAPH> These kinds of memories are still very much alive in British coalfield communities like this, even though almost all of the mines closed two to three decades ago, after a bitter year-long miners strike spurred by then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s move to break the once-powerful union. Sparks says she remembers the “pit strike” well—she lived in the nearby “terraced houses,” as the densely-packed miners’ homes were known, and “we didn’t get much sleep, the police were always out making so much noise.” <PARAGRAPH> The two women were admiring a monument by local coal miner turned artist Harry Malkin. This monument is on the site of a former coal mine, Allerton Bywater, though if it weren’t for the monument you would never know it, as it is currently occupied by a modern, bright housing development called Horizons Millennium Village. <PARAGRAPH> Malkin’s piece features two coal tubs overflowing with bright flowers emblazoned with the names of the 87 miners who were killed here, as well as those who were laid off when the pit closed in 1992. Behind the tubs is a carved brick replica of the “pit cage” that would lower miners into the depths of the earth, a rectangular box with chains ascending into the sky. Bas-relief images on the cage show mining technology and the National Union of Mineworkers on the march. At night, the monument is bathed in gentle floodlights, luminous. The base is crowded with wreaths of flowers and handwritten heartfelt notes, placed here after a brass band led thousands on a parade and unveiling ceremony the previous week where locals recited the names of the dead. <PARAGRAPH> Like many in this region, Malkin started mining when he was 15, “school-leaving age” as it was known, and spent two decades working underground until the Fryston mine closed shortly after the 1984-1985 strike. For much of his career, Malkin worked on the coal face, often laying in seams less than three feet tall to assemble or repair machinery. <PARAGRAPH> “Looking back now (the mines closing) was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Malkin says. “Mining broke a lot of people.” <PARAGRAPH> While injury and death statistics have dropped drastically as technology has advanced, Malkin doesn’t necessarily see “modern mining” as any safer than the old days. “Now it will just kill you slower,” he said, noting that he knows “blokes who at 35 could hardly breathe” from pneumoconiosis or black lung disease from the thick chocking dust made by the machines. “It’s crazy that blokes fight for jobs like that.” <PARAGRAPH> As a kid, Malkin was always drawing, and after the mine closed, he had a few works in local exhibitions, sold them, “and saw there’s some money in this, I’ll give it a try.” There weren’t many other jobs available. After the strike, he applied at a local coal-fired power plant, “just for a laugh, as after being on strike for a year who is going to hire you!” <PARAGRAPH> Malkin ended up with a studio overlooking the Glass Houghton coal mine, and watched its transformation over the years. “It was amazing, something you never could have imagined. I thought I would finish (mining) at Fryston and die there like many more did,” he said. <PARAGRAPH> Malkin has exhibited throughout England and Wales and has some of his works in other countries, including Russia and Switzerland. He remembers one of his biggest shows on the South Bank, London, just opposite the house of Parliament where “not a bugger there was a miner. One city gent bought five pieces to give his daughter, who spent money like water, to show her what real working people do.” <PARAGRAPH> Malkin vastly prefers the life of an artist to that of a miner. But mining permeates almost all of his works: dusky drawings and paintings of miners hard at work and other monuments and sculptures celebrating the mining industry and heritage of Yorkshire. In a marshy field not far away rises a graceful, whimsical steel fish, which Malkin made from tub wheels, girders and other metalwork used in mines. It is part of the Yorkshire Art Circus' “Walking on Cold Coal” project that commemorates another now-disappeared mine. <PARAGRAPH> The Yorkshire Art Circus and founder Brian Lewis were key to launching Malkin’s career. Lewis is a poet, teacher and painter who during the mine closures, worked with coalfield residents to help them write a series of books—published and distributed at breakneck speed before the internet made that common—spreading information about the pit closures and describing the human impact. <PARAGRAPH> Another of Malkin’s works commemorates the Athersley pit disaster of 1936, with an eight-foot-high sculpture made from local bricks showing miners looking for survivors after an explosion that killed 59. He also commemorates soldiers killed in Afghanistan and the once-thriving pottery industry in Castleford, the hometown of both Malkin and sculptor Henry Moore, also the son of a coal miner. <PARAGRAPH> Gallery owner Greg McGee was quoted during a 2011 Malkin show, describing his deep understanding of the aesthetics of mining: “Cheeks and eye sockets are ink black, shoulders are slick crescents, and amidst the trembling chiaroscuro the figures quicken and bristle in their brutal work. Their poise and movements are perfectly calibrated with the instinct and knowledge hewn from many decades’ worth of witnessing and working more than one mile deep underground.” <PARAGRAPH> Malkin shares the view of many former miners that “after the mining union went, the unions have no real power anymore”—the strike and destruction of British coal mining “broke the spirit of the working class.” But unlike other former miners who think Thatcher destroyed a vibrant industry, Malkin believes the mines would have closed eventually anyway, even under a Labour government. He laments that England now gets most of the coal for its power plants and industry from afar—South Africa, Colombia, Russia, even the United States. <PARAGRAPH> Though in places like Castleford the memories of the coal mining days are still very present and monuments like Malkin’s dot the landscape, he is afraid that as the generations pass the legacy will fade away. He notes decreased government funding for the National Coal Mining Museum and the smaller museums and commemorative projects throughout the area. Meanwhile, almost all of the old mining sites have been transformed into new developments like the Horizons residential project. <PARAGRAPH> “Not only do they destroy the industry but try to wipe away all traces of it,” says Malkin. “We’ve got all these museums for the late and great but not museums for the little people. In two or three generations, we might be forgotten completely.”
Chicagoans Ask City Councillors To Fight Emanuel’s Cruelest Cuts | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO—Today, members of the City Council's Progressive Caucus are delivering the news to Mayor Rahm Emanuel and about 40 of their fellow councilmen that scores of Chicagoans have deep reservations about the proposed 2013 budget and what it means for jobs, families and public sector unions. Many Chicagoans are furious, afraid and skeptical about the proposed budget that they charge will usher in another wave of privatization, layoffs and service cuts in the name of “reform,” efficiency and deficit reduction. <PARAGRAPH> But Emanuel and a great majority of the 50 city councilmen might not be aware of these concerns, because Emanuel broke with almost three decades of tradition by refusing to hold evening public meetings about the budget. Instead he is offering a public hearing today—an under-publicized event in the middle of the day which many working people will not be able to attend—and he has invited the submission of comments online. <PARAGRAPH> Unions, community groups and the progressive city councilmen have said this isn’t good enough, so the Progressive Caucus held three hearings of their own, including one yesterday at a South Side high school. <PARAGRAPH> As at the other two meetings, attendees yesterday railed against privatization of city jobs and services, from the water department to animal control to the finance department and emergency response call centers to janitorial services and charter schools. Members of SEIU, AFSCME and the Chicago Teachers Union turned out in force for the meetings, describing in sometimes wrenching detail the impact of last year’s budget cuts and the possible effect of the proposed 2013 budget on public sector workers and their families. <PARAGRAPH> Contracts and Cuts <PARAGRAPH> In some cases, city service jobs are already privatized, in that they are contracted out to private contractors. But Emanuel’s aggressive push to find cheaper contracts has meant endangering or simply ending union jobs, replacing them with non-union and lower-paid jobs with contractors who offered the city a cheaper deal. In his  mayoral victory speech in May 2011, Emanuel said: <PARAGRAPH> “It’s time for tough choices because denial in the face of challenge is no strategy for success. … As we move forward, we face serious new challenges and overcoming them will not be easy. It requires new ideas, cooperation and sacrifice from everyone involved. We must make sure that every community in Chicago is heard and included and has a chance to participate in that future.” <PARAGRAPH> Critics point out that Chicagoans have had to make plenty of sacrifices in the past year, including with their jobs and pensions, but the mayor’s failure to hold community budget hearings shows a lack of genuine interest in community input and participation. <PARAGRAPH> At the alternative budget hearings, residents and community leaders also repeatedly pointed out that cost-cutting contracts and layoffs often have significant hidden costs, from sub-par performance and cost over-runs to the fact that contractors do not need to live within city limits and hence may not channel their wages into Chicago’s tax base. <PARAGRAPH> While the 2013 budget doesn’t explicitly propose many layoffs, union leaders and others who have analyzed it fear de facto layoffs and job cuts through privatization and competitive bidding. At yesterday's hearing, speakers stressed how minority workers and communities are likely to be disproportionately impacted by belt-tightening in the 2013 budget, just as they were in 2012. <PARAGRAPH> “They’re dismantling our office, which is primarily minorities,” said Greg Turner, an employee of the city’s finance department call center. <PARAGRAPH> Low-income minority neighborhoods are suffering a double whammy, as public service cuts and privatization mean poor or low-income minority residents lose jobs, while also likely losing city services. <PARAGRAPH> Mental Health Movement <PARAGRAPH> A perfect example is the closing of six of the city’s 12 public mental health clinics last spring, which meant the layoff of numerous staff, disproportionately minorities. AFSCME, which represents workers at mental health clinics, released a report yesterday that analyzes the impact of the clinic closings. It found that between 500 and 2,000 clinic patients have “disappeared” from city records between 2011 and 2012, depending how their cases are classified. The report says the statistical discrepancy indicates that hundreds or possibly thousands of patients were never notified by the city about their options in the face of the clinic closings, and instead relied on the grassroots, all-volunteer Mental Health Movement for information. <PARAGRAPH> AFSCME Special Projects Director and report author Jo Patton said that, “A number of therapists we’ve talked to now have more than 100 patients. We want the city to rehire Spanish-speaking therapists, African-American therapists, male therapists, because those things have a lot to do with how people bond with their therapist." <PARAGRAPH> The special bond patients develop with hard-working, caring therapists—and how important that connection can be to their very survival—is one of the factors that can easily get overlooked in a bottom-line driven approach that ignores effects on the ground in communities. <PARAGRAPH> Before the budget hearing, Jeanette Hansen and Margaret Sullivan described to me how their therapist Eric Lindquist at the now-closed Beverly-Morgan Park mental health clinic has literally saved patients’ lives. <PARAGRAPH> “I’m manic depressive, I see black and white, I felt like if the world doesn’t want me alive then fine,” said Sullivan, 58, a former college English professor with a doctorate from UCLA, about a crisis she suffered a decade ago. “But Eric talked me into living another week. He taught me how to stay alive, he told me you go out into the community, he got me tutoring and working with special needs kids.” <PARAGRAPH> They said Lindquist moved to the far southwest side neighborhood from the city’s north side in order to be closer to work and his patients, and that he would often “cross the alley” from his home to meet with a patient or take a phone call after hours. Sullivan said that she and other clinic clients became desperately despondent upon hearing the clinic would close, but Lindquist urged them to channel their despair into activism, opening a whole new world to them in the process. <PARAGRAPH> Now Sullivan and Hansen travel up to two hours by public transportation to see Lindquist at the clinic where he has been reassigned.  At least they have that option, difficult as it can be. Many therapists were laid off—including all of the African-American male therapists in the system, according to AFSCME—so many patients are completely cut-off from the people who had been their lifeline. <PARAGRAPH> The Mental Health Movement, a group of clinic patients and supporters that coalesced after former Mayor Richard M. Daley proposed closing clinics in 2009, has demanded that the 2013 budget include funds to reopen the six closed clinics to fully staff all clinics. They are also calling for more mental health resources in the schools, especially given the violence and other trauma many students face. <PARAGRAPH> Police Officers and Politics <PARAGRAPH> The October 30 community budget hearing was moderated by Cliff Kelley, a popular radio host and former Chicago city councilman. He noted that, “You know what group has asked me to try to keep those mental health clinics open? The police.” <PARAGRAPH> Police officers, who are currently engaged in contentious contract negotiations with the mayor’s office, are stretched thin, especially given the escalating gang violence that has made international news this year. Mental Health Movement members say that during their various sit-ins and occupations over the past year, including a stand-off at one of the clinics about to be closed, police officers have been sympathetic. Chicagoans with mental health issues and police officers have publicly agreed that law enforcement is not equipped to deal with and should not be burdened with people causing disturbances because of mental illness. <PARAGRAPH> Speakers at the hearing chastened the aldermen for voting unanimously for the 2012 budget, which included the clinic closings and hundreds of job cuts. <PARAGRAPH> They also praised the aldermen for holding the alternative hearings, and challenged them to stand up to the mayor, promising political support in return. They directed this message particularly at Alderman Bob Fioretti, whose ward has basically disappeared as a result of gerrymandered redistricting—a move some described as retaliation for his speaking out against last year’s budget. <PARAGRAPH> Members of the Mental Health Movement and other critics pointed out that last year 28 aldermen signed a letter criticizing cuts in the 2012 budget, including the clinic closings, but then ultimately voted for it. Many think they backed off in fear of Emanuel’s power in general and the idea that he wants to cut in half the number of city councilmen. <PARAGRAPH> “Please aldermen, don’t let this be a 50-0 vote,” said Barney Franklin, president of AFSCME Local 2946, which represents employees of the city water department targeted for privatization. “If you support us we will support you.”
The Original Coal Country | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Kari Lydersen recently spent a week in England reporting on coal mining and coalfield communities through a Climate Media Fellowship from the Heinrich Boll Foundation North America. Three profiles to come will feature coalfield figures bridging the past and present of this once-mighty industry. <PARAGRAPH> WAKEFIELD, YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND—Years after the closures of the coal mines where he once worked, Andy Smith still dons his mining gear nearly every day and heads underground. During breaks he hangs out with other miners, covered in coal dust and grime, in a grungy small locker room where they make bawdy jokes in thick Scottish and Yorkshire accents almost unintelligible to an outsiders. <PARAGRAPH> Smith and his colleagues are guides at the National Coal Mining Museum in Wakefield, one of the many “coalfield communities” in Yorkshire in central England. Nearly all of the underground coalmines in these parts, which used to employ tens of thousands of miners, have closed—the victim of competition from cheaper imported coal and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s concerted attack on the once-powerful National Union of Mineworkers. <PARAGRAPH> The brutal yearlong strike of 1984-1985 turned coalfield communities into virtual war zones. The union opposed a systematic mine-closure plan and the government’s attempts to gut their labor rights. Former miners and their families describe the stand-off even now as if it was yesterday: police roadblocks where people were pulled out of vehicles and beaten; scores of picketing miners severely injured by nightsticks and kicks to the head; miners’ families barely scraping by with no heat in their homes and little food; and bitter conflict between the majority of striking miners and those who continued working. <PARAGRAPH> Though the strike was ultimately a failure—many of the mines closed for good over the following decade -- it was also a time of ecstatic solidarity and revolt. Miners and their wives traveled the country and even internationally, speaking about their struggle. Support poured in from around England and abroad. And women who previously saw their most important duty as having dinner on the table for their husbands were suddenly organizing and protesting autonomously. The group Women Against Pit Closures played a crucial role in the labor movement. <PARAGRAPH> In Yorkshire today there are few visual reminders of the strike or the legendary coal mining industry that once powered much of the country and formed the bedrock for thriving, rough-but-close-knit “pit towns.” They were known for their vibrant, distinct cultures, including raising pigeons and ferrets, playing rugby and football, and throwing annual galas and local “welfare societies” that made sure families’ needs were met. <PARAGRAPH> “My father raised greyhounds; people raised pigeons and had gardens; on holidays as a kid you could go around and the retired miners would give you tea and a sandwich,” recalls Willy McGranahan, a former miner, originally from Scotland, who serves as deputy director at the mining museum.  “The pit was more than just a job, it was a way of life. That’s gone now, people are more isolated.” <PARAGRAPH> “It’s sad,” adds miner-turned-museum guide David Halsted, nicknamed “Chewbacca” for his striking resemblance to the Star Wars character. “It’s very much like being in the army, you look after your friends and colleagues and they look after you. That time spent in village working men’s clubs, in pubs—that social togetherness is all gone.” <PARAGRAPH> Most of the mine infrastructure was dismantled shortly after pits (as underground mines in England are called) were closed, and now most of the spoil heaps—composed of waste rock and detritus—are covered in grass and blend into the landscape. <PARAGRAPH>  A full generation has passed since the mine closures, and another generation is growing up. As intrinsic as mining has been to the area’s identity, collective memories fade. A major goal of the National Coal Mining Museum and smaller museums in individual coalfield communities is to keep alive the history of mining and what it meant to people and communities in places like Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Durham. <PARAGRAPH> Smith and the other miners who now work as tour guides say they love their jobs, where they are still spending their days in a mine but imparting knowledge rather than extracting coal. They lead visitors through a sprawling stretch of the former working underground mine known as Caphouse. In the underground mine, equipment from throughout the ages and surprisingly lifelike statues of humans depict the working conditions of miners from the Victorian era on. <PARAGRAPH> Working conditions for the miners in the 1800s—from the Victorian Era through the Industrial Revolution—were truly shocking, even given the generally hellish conditions for workers in those days. Families worked as teams, spending much of their life on their hands and knees toiling in near-complete darkness. <PARAGRAPH> Statues in the mine tour illustrate how men would hack coal loose from the walls from a sitting or lying position, while their wives would crawl on all fours, pulling or pushing the coal in a wooden cart, originally without wheels, fastened by chains around their waists. The couples worked with only a small candle, purchased like their other equipment from the landowner. They would mine in chambers blocked by a wooden door to guard against gas explosions. Children as young as 6 also worked in the mines. <PARAGRAPH> In 1842, women and children under 10 were banned from working underground, so they were replaced with the famous “pit ponies,” who often lived their whole lives underground. Conditions improved greatly after the mines were nationalized in 1947, and miners and pit ponies were granted two weeks off a year. Fatalities dropped from 357 per 100,000 workers in 1886 to 30 in 1971, according to the Yorkshire mining history Remembering How it Was, by editor and labor journalist Granville Williams. <PARAGRAPH> While Smith marvels at the primitive and terrifying conditions under which the Victorians labored, he and other 20th-century miners spent countless hours working in a way that was not so different: lying prone in seams just 20 inches high, harvesting coal by hand (albeit with electric tools). <PARAGRAPH> Smith said, “I have bad knees. A lot of people have bad backs, vibration white finger” (blood vessel constriction and nerve damage from holding vibrating drills). Not to mention, of course, black lung disease and other disabling respiratory ailments. <PARAGRAPH> Many former miners have contradictory feelings about their past work—they miss the camaraderie, the feeling of purpose, the challenge; and they are infuriated by the political decision to leave millions of tons of coal unharvested belowground. But they shake their heads in awe of what they used to do. <PARAGRAPH> “I worked under this table for 20 years,” said Harry Malkin to a gathering of former miners at Williams’ home, gesturing to the several-foot-high space below the dinner table. Now Malkin makes his living as an artist, including creating memorials for laid off and killed miners. “I must have been out of my mind. We were crawling around in a Victorian atmosphere, eating where you crap, crapping where you eat.  It was not even Victorian, more like Neanderthal.” <PARAGRAPH> The museum’s underground tour also tracks mining technology as it evolved to extract more and more coal with less and less manpower. Smith worked on the massive machines used in larger seams which became increasingly common after the 1960s, known as the “long wall” method. Smith operated a series of hydraulic posts to keep the mine ceiling from caving in, while a giant machine on caterpillar tracks chewed away coal, dumping it onto a conveyor belt. As the machine crept along underground, large sections of the roof were allowed to collapse behind it. This caused the “surface subsidence” seen in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and many other coal-mining areas—where the earth sinks or caves in, causing houses on the surface to crack and slump. <PARAGRAPH> England’s coal-fired power plants are now supplied with coal largely from high-tech, massive open-pit mines in other countries, including the Cerrejon in Colombia, where no tunneling is needed. Gigantic machines simply gouge out huge swaths of earth and then remove the coal, with relatively few workers involved. Coal exporter Australia has pioneered unmanned mining machinery, and analysts say that the future of Australia’s coal industry lies in highly automated mines deep underground where production levels could dwarf anything seen today. <PARAGRAPH> The mass importing of coal irks miners such as Malkin—not only because it meant the decimation of their union and their proud industry, but also because they’ve heard about the labor, human rights and environmental debacles in many of the mining industries from which Britain imports coal. These include indigenous communities brutally displaced for mine expansions, children working hard jobs without adequate safety equipment, contaminated water and shorn-off mountaintops. <PARAGRAPH> “I believe in the market economy, but we’re importing coal from Peru and Colombia, places with almost slave labor,” said Halsted. “That’s wrong.”
Romney’s Bain in the Ass | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> As throngs of eager Republicans and the rains of Tropical Storm Isaac have descended on Tampa, so too have a contingent of workers from companies owned by Bain Capital, the private-equity firm co-founded by presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Calling themselves “Ambassadors of the 99 Percent,” the workers from Bain-affiliated companies around the country are speaking out about their poor working conditions and wages--and their belief that things would get worse for everyday people under a president with a Bain mentality. <PARAGRAPH> The workers convened at a rally Sunday in Tampa, joining a crowd of people protesting the convention. Nearby, Code Pink members dressed as vaginas to protest the Republican stand on abortion and contraception, dog-owners brought their canines to highlight Romney’s famous dog-on-the-roof road trip, and a man carried a six-foot silver spoon with Romney’s name on it. <PARAGRAPH> A major protest focusing specifically on Bain Capital is planned for August 30, during Romney’s nomination acceptance speech. Occupy Tampa promises that: “We will use this opportunity to protest and raise awareness about Bain Capital’s business practices. Hopefully this will pressure Bain Capital to behave ethically.” (Salon.com recently noted that Tampa itself is a perfect example of failed Republican social welfare and development policies, due in part to the work of financial firms like Bain.) <PARAGRAPH> For months, Obama backers and workers rights groups have highlighted Bain’s reputation for taking over and closing or outsourcing companies, and more recently for poor working conditions and pay at Bain-owned companies. <PARAGRAPH> Unions and workers rights groups have been held actions around the country at Dunkin’ Donuts and other well-known companies owned or co-owned by Bain and its subsidiaries. In addition to Dunkin', these include Clear Channel Communications, Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, Roy’s Hawaiian Fusion Cuisine, Burlington Coat Factory, Baskin Robbins, Gymboree, Hospital Corporation of America, Michael’s Craft Store, Toys’R’Us, Staples, The Princeton Review and Work ‘N Gear. <PARAGRAPH> On Saturday, workers from Bain-owned companies departed for the convention from JFK airport in New York. Organized with the group United NY, they included employees of Dunkin’ Donuts, Burlington Coat Factory and Air Serv Corporation. <PARAGRAPH> A group of Illinois workers is heading for Florida from Sensata Technologies, a Bain-owned sensor manufacturer based in Freeport, Ill. As David Moberg recently reported for In These Times, the 170 mostly female workers who will lose their jobs are being forced to train their visiting Chinese replacements as the factory is disassembled. <PARAGRAPH> Three Wisconsin workers left for Tampa from a send-off event at a Dunkin Donuts in Milwaukee. Sam Moore, a Dunkin Donuts worker and a young father of two from Pittsburgh, told local media that he earns $7.25 an hour, not enough to cover gas and basic costs. <PARAGRAPH> Bain and two other equity firms, The Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, purchased the company that owns Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins for $2.425 billion in 2005. (In a strange twist, it’s been reported that with the buyout Bain Capital “saved” the site of Michelle and Barack Obama’s first kiss, at a Baskin Robbins in Hyde Park in 1989.) <PARAGRAPH> in the case of Dunkin’ Donuts, prevailing wages were low even before the Bain takeover. While some Bain deals result in outsourcing jobs and squeezing workers, in other cases it’s unclear how to what extent Bain is responsible for specific working conditions and wages at its subsidiaries. Certainly workers also face exploitative conditions at non-Bain-owned corporations. <PARAGRAPH> But on a broader scale, the Bain-focused campaigns serve to highlight the conditions of labor in the United States as a whole. It's typical for hugely profitable corporations to pay poverty wages while relying on ethically questionable international supply chains. Bain is certainly no exception; quick Google searches turn up various complaints and charges of labor law violations, poor working conditions or disturbing supply chain issues for almost all the Bain-linked companies. <PARAGRAPH> For example, this year Toys ‘R’ Us was named one of the city’s worst employers by United NY, along with a chain of car washes, an airline service and the utility company Con Edison. The group said most Toys ‘R’ Us workers make less than $10 an hour–a paltry wage, especially in New York City–while the company’s CEO makes $8 million a year. “If you are making this amount of profit, the least that you can do is pay your workers a decent wage," said United NY executive director Camilla Rivera. <PARAGRAPH> Other Bain subsidiaries have been targeted by activists, employees and the federal government over working conditions: <PARAGRAPH> Toys ‘R’ Us has also been fined by the federal government for dangerous conditions at a Brooklyn store. Workers at an Outback Steakhouse in Calumet City, Ill. filed a class action lawsuit in 2011 charging state and federal labor law violations including tips and wages withheld. Gymboree and Toys ‘R’ Us are among many national companies targeted by labor rights activists as buying products made overseas with child labor. Last fall Gymboree agreed to stop buying cotton sourced from Uzbekistan, where child field labor is common, though activists say the company still sources other products from areas known for child labor. Toys ‘R’ Us has in the past faced federal child labor violation charges at its US stores, involving restrictions on working hours for 14- and 15-year-olds. Earlier this year Gymboree was ordered to pay $430,000 to Massachusetts employees for denying meal breaks mandated under state labor law. Bain was also at the center of the controversial anti-Romney ad by a pro-Obama super PAC that insinuated Romney deserved blame for a woman’s death from cancer after her husband was laid off from a Bain-owned steel mill, leaving her without health insurance. (The Obama campaign said they had no role in the commercial and did not know the steel worker). <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile a post on the website AboutMyJob.com--a site for stories venting about degrading conditions, short shifts and annoying customers--sheds light on what it is like to work at Baskin Robbins: <PARAGRAPH> "You go through all this frustration, for two weeks, and then the paycheck comes. This, to most people is the day when it is all worth it, all the customers, the screaming kids, nope. Not to me. It is a huge let down knowing that in two years, and becoming manager, I only make 60 cents over minimum wage. Yes that’s right… only 60 cents. 10 cents at your one year mark people! How exciting right?? Nope… slap in the face."
Chicago Protesters: “Take TIFs Off the Menu!” | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Some unusual offerings were on the menu Tuesday at the Chicago restaurant Fulton’s on the River: <PARAGRAPH> “River Point Plaza: A generous portion of useless private space, drizzled with the sweat of working families. Served with a side of your tax dollars.” Price: $29.5 million. <PARAGRAPH> “United Airlines: A flight of public money reserved to shift 350 jobs from the suburbs to downtown." Despite the $30 million price tag, "peanuts and beverages are not included with this flight." <PARAGRAPH> The mock menu was handed out by members of the Grassroots Collaborative in protest of public TIF (tax increment financing) money being used to finance private developments. Among those private projects is the new River Point Plaza, to be built on land owned by real estate developer Larry Levy and his family, who preside over a “vast restaurant kingdom” that includes Fulton's. <PARAGRAPH> TIFs are meant to revitalize “blighted” areas and create jobs by allowing a portion of property tax funds to subsidize development. But in Chicago, the program has long been surrounded by scandal. Wealthy areas like the downtown riverfront are designated TIFs, allowing taxpayer funds that otherwise would have gone to parks and schools to be turned over to private developers. <PARAGRAPH> For years, former Mayor Richard M. Daley was accused by tenacious Chicago Reader reporter Ben Joravsky and others of using TIF money as a private piggy bank to reward politically connected developers. Now, in his first year in office, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has continued to leverage TIFs in ways grassroots groups say are unethical and unjust. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel's "River Point Plaza" will be a $60 million park and tunnel to nearby Union Station, connected to a new “sculptural office tower” developed by real-estate giant Ivanhoe Cambridge. With $29.5 million in TIF money, the city is shouldering half the cost. <PARAGRAPH> Outside Levy’s restaurant, protestors from labor unions and community groups chanted, “Whose money? Our money!” and “Shut down the LaSalle Central TIF,” which covers the area. LaSalle Central TIF money has also been used as an incentive for corporations to move their headquarters there. United Airlines, Willis Holdings–which owns the famous tower formerly known as Sears–and Coors/ Miller Lite received millions in taxpayer funds for this purpose, to the tune of $30 million, $3.8 million and $6 million, respectively.  <PARAGRAPH> City officials have argued that developments like River Point Plaza create jobs and improve the economy for people across the socioeconomic spectrum. There are measures in the TIF agreements meant to guarantee jobs and contracts go to a diverse group of Chicago residents. For example, the United Airlines agreement mandates that 50 percent of construction workers be city residents and that a quarter of contractors be minority-owned businesses and 4 percent be women-owned. It stipulates that by phase two of the project, the headquarters must relocate at least 2,500 employees to the city and bring in another 2,500 external employees. <PARAGRAPH> But critics aren’t buying it. <PARAGRAPH> “There’s all this focus on downtown with the idea that it will trickle down to the neighborhoods--but in fact it’s mostly making it harder for the neighborhoods,” Grassroots Collaborative executive director Amisha Patel told In These Times. The Collaborative’s members include the Chicago Teachers Union, SEIU Local 73, Action Now and the Organization of the Northeast (ONE). “The mayor talks about bringing all these jobs downtown, but often they are jobs that already had workers, just moving downtown from the suburbs." <PARAGRAPH> She adds: "One of the biggest sources of quality jobs [for lower-income and minority residents] is the public sector, but we’re closing mental health clinics [and] schools." <PARAGRAPH> Many Teachers Union members take the diversion of property tax dollars especially personally since the city’s schools are desperately underfunded. The teachers have spent the past year in bitter public battles and highly polarized contract negotiations with Mayor Emanuel and the school board. They say it is ironic that the city can funnel to private developers many millions of dollars that otherwise could have gone to schools; yet money cannot be found to revamp struggling schools slated for closing, or to pay teachers what an independent arbiter said they deserve for a longer school day mandated by Emanuel. <PARAGRAPH> “They’re destabilizing our schools and using our black and brown children as pawns,” said CTU member Sherrie Parker, who had taught at Guggenheim Elementary, one of the schools that was controversially closed. “TIF money is our money. It should go to education, not to (owners of) fancy restaurants.” <PARAGRAPH> The protestors handed out the satirical menus and waved signs at diners and at the Chicago water taxis that pulled up along the dock for a closer look (before being told to leave by the restaurant). They chanted: “We’re hungry, we’re broke, we can’t pay the rent. We must not be part of the 1 percent!” <PARAGRAPH> Protest participant Sijisfredo Aviles said he’s seen TIF money used appropriately in his neighborhood of Humboldt Park, a mostly Puerto Rican area on the city’s west side. Affordable housing was created there with the help of TIF dollars, providing homes for vulnerable people and creating jobs for local residents. <PARAGRAPH> “The idea with TIFs was to create jobs and stabilize communities,” said Aviles, who was laid off from his job in substance abuse counseling for youth because of state budget cuts. “We don’t need to stabilize downtown…This is an excuse to siphon off money that should have gone to park districts and give it to investors. It’s a rip-off.” <PARAGRAPH> Protest participant Danielle Kenny with the group Action Now said a “gentleman” walked past her and said, “Why don’t you just find a job?” <PARAGRAPH> “Well that’s exactly what I’m trying to do!” she said. “Silly man.” 
Going Undercover to Determine the Real Price of Sex | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Jenea often still feels the same way she did when she was being held captive in Turkey and forced to have sex with up to 50 men a day, after having left her small Bulgarian village in hopes of a job abroad. <PARAGRAPH> “It would have been better for me not to be born,” she says. She tried to escape by climbing out a window and down a pipe, but took a serious fall and blacked out. Her captors forced her to continue working even as she was partially paralyzed and unable to feel what was being done to her. Finally they let her call her sister Natalia, who came to get her. But Natalia was told that Jenea still owed $450 for travel and living expenses, and they forced Natalia to work as a prostitute for a month to pay off the debt. <PARAGRAPH> Jenea and Natalia are among the Eastern European women featured in photojournalist and filmmaker Mimi Chakarova’s 2011 documentary The Price of Sex (which is accompanied by an excellent multimedia series available free online). Global sex trafficking has been the subject of many investigative stories, documentaries and reports; it is not a crisis that lacks attention. But still, Chakarova’s work stands out from the other admirable and also not-so-admirable efforts to document this shadowy world. <PARAGRAPH> This is due in part to Chakarova’s personal connection to the issue. She left Bulgaria as a young child with her family, as the economy collapsed with the fall of the Iron Curtain, but she found upon return visits that girls from her own village had ended up disappearing—literally—into trafficking networks. She feels like that fate could easily have been her own. As she said during a recent rebroadcast of a “Snap Judgment” piece on National Public Radio, she was disgusted by sensational media images of trafficked Eastern European women wearing lingerie and heavy makeup because she thought that these images—often shot by men— dehumanized the women and contributed to stereotypes. She pursued her own work on the topic with intense passion, courage and dedication; she even went undercover as a trafficked women, working with complicit men and women she met through survivors’ networks, and in doing so risked actually being “sold” (in which case she figured she might kill herself). <PARAGRAPH> I haven’t actually seen the documentary The Price of Sex, which won several high-profile awards at film festivals last year, but after hearing Chakarova’s radio interview and viewing the lengthy multi-media piece, I felt anyone interested in labor issues should be aware of her work. <PARAGRAPH> Chakarova delves into each woman’s individual story with gently probing and empathetic questions, while also explaining the larger socioeconomic context of the problem, beginning with the simple economic inequities between countries—in this case a direct result of the fall of Communism. <PARAGRAPH> Martin Wyss, chief of Mission International Organization for Migration in Moldova, told her: <PARAGRAPH> It wasn’t just that there wasn’t any money left or infrastructure…there was severe corruption, and these circumstances destroyed the social fabric. Families were ripped apart, alcoholism increased, suicides went up, life expectancies were reduced, migration…created a lot of victims. Many people were left behind, many were left to their own devices. For all intents and purposes there was anarchy…Those who were already weaker would be taken advantage of. <PARAGRAPH> Chakarova notes that most women are recruited by neighbors or acquaintances, or even their own siblings or parents. The recruiters and the women themselves may or may not know the type of work —unpaid slavery, more accurately—that lies in store for them. She says it’s a complicated question, with no simple answer. Wyss adds: <PARAGRAPH> If you make $50 a month and you have a sick mother and the father is dead and the younger brother has to go to school and you are accumulating debts to pay for the treatment of your mother, you have to do something…men start to steal, women may resort to prostitution. <PARAGRAPH> As Ion Vizdoga, an NGO attorney fighting trafficking, told Chakarova in an interview, "When in a village of 2,000 only 50 people have jobs, young people have two choices: Commit crimes to survive, or leave the country and risk being trafficked.” <PARAGRAPH> Sex workers and advocates frequently complain—rightly—that sex workers in general and trafficked women specifically are too often portrayed by media and aid organizations as passive victims. But while Chakarova shows that trafficked women are victimized horrifically by individual men, organized crime groups and larger social and economic systems, she also shows their strength in surviving not only the trafficking, but also the grueling daily life—the experience of being a poor woman in a poor country—that awaits those who do escape. <PARAGRAPH> One of the most heart-breaking aspects of Chakarova’s reporting is the current situation of the women who have escaped trafficking, many of whom find themselves trapped in lives of poverty and deprivation. These survivors are often jobless and suffering permanent health effects, severe psychological trauma and disabilities caused by the trafficking; furthermore, they are often stigmatized by their villages and families. Given the abundance of NGO, governmental and media attention paid to trafficking, one would hope that these women would be offered some economic opportunities and resources after all they’ve been through; the fact they are not reflects the dire economic situation in these countries, especially in rural areas, and illustrates why they continue to be such fertile ground for traffickers even as the horror stories filter out. <PARAGRAPH> Though The Price of Sex focuses on Eastern European women trafficked within Europe and the Middle East, in the accompanying multimedia piece Chakarova also quotes a former FBI agent who notes the responsibility of the U.S. in global trafficking, in terms of both the trafficking that occurs here and the participation of U.S. citizens in sex tourism abroad. That’s not to mention the role of U.S. policy and U.S. corporations in a global economy that is based on low-paid work and migration. <PARAGRAPH> Chakarova also explores the depressing fact that much of the money going to fight trafficking in Eastern Europe gets absorbed by state agencies who then are motivated to make it appear they are exposing trafficking cases; in reality, little or none of the money goes to the rural impoverished villages, either to help alleviate the situations that facilitate trafficking or to aid the victims. <PARAGRAPH> Ana Revenco, founder of the sex trafficking escape hotline La Strada, said: <PARAGRAPH> It’s the big discrepancy between poor countries and rich countries, the big discrepancy in access to justice, high levels of corruption…Unless you address these issues, all these hotlines will not solve the situation.
Radical History from Bristol to Chicago | <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO, July 3—The sounds of exploding firecrackers, loud music and kids shouting at a block party on the street outside punctuated the narrative spun by Roger and Samuel inside Casa Aztlan, a long-time bastion of organizing in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood. The people outside were celebrating American Independence Day, while the visiting Brits were telling stories about American history that happened here in Chicago and shaped U.S. society as we know it today, yet are largely unknown by most Americans. <PARAGRAPH> Samuel and Roger (who don’t use their last names publicly) are members of the Bristol Radical History Group, which aims to reveal hidden histories and critique, debunk or expand upon accepted ones, from the mainstream versions we learn in school to the work of other radical historians and trade union scribes. They also focus on making these histories relevant to events and struggles of today. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> On Tuesday, before a small crowd in nearly 100-degree heat, they spoke about Industrial Workers of the World co-founder Lucy Parsons—specifically, her often-overlooked role in the labor movement and her ground-breaking radicalism and feminism. As Roger and Samuel described her, Parsons was a fiercely class conscious and independent spirit, denied her due by Communist, Anarchist, Socialist, feminist and mainstream establishments that didn’t quite know what to make of her. <PARAGRAPH> Roger described visiting Forest Home/ Waldheim Cemetery in the Chicago suburbs—which is “like Disneyland” to labor history buffs thanks to all the luminary organizers buried there—and being saddened to see that Lucy Parsons had only a small flat headstone, compared to the impressive monuments and markers afforded other residents like Emma Goldman. <PARAGRAPH> Samuel juxtaposed Parsons with Goldman and described the animosity between the two women. While Goldman found her audience largely among the middle- or upper-class intelligentsia in New York, he said, Parsons was “in militant working class Chicago.” While Goldman is widely known for her views on free love, Samuel noted that Parsons also advocated freedom of sexuality, but saw it as tangential to the struggle for workers' rights and economic equality. He thinks this is one of the reasons that more than a century later, Parsons is not as famous as Goldman. At the time, the two women frequently traded barbs, and Samuel said their research shows that Parsons' substantive critiques of Goldman were met with “catty, snotty” insults; Goldman referred to Parsons dismissively as merely the widow of “our martyr Albert Parsons”—hanged after the infamous Haymarket Affair—and accused her of riding her husband’s coattails (or “cape”). <PARAGRAPH> In a 1976 book published by Chicago’s Charles H. Kerr Publishing Co., Carolyn Ashbaugh described the rivalry: <PARAGRAPH> Lucy Parsons' feminism, which analyzed women's oppression as a function of capitalism, was founded on working class values. Emma Goldman’s feminism took on an abstract character of freedom for women in all things, in all times, and in all places; her feminism became separate from its working class origins. Goldman represented the feminism being advocated in the anarchist movement of the 1890s [and after]. The intellectual anarchists questioned Lucy Parsons about her attitudes on the women's question. <PARAGRAPH> Lucy Parsons continued to tour the U.S. speaking and organizing for decades after the execution of her husband and comrades, even as her eyesight and health were failing. She died in a house fire on the city’s north side in 1942, and police raided the home “while it was still smoking,” in Samuel’s words, seizing about 3,000 documents that he said are still in FBI custody, despite the efforts to obtain them. "Why do they continue to hold the papers of someone who died [seven decades ago]?" Roger asked. "What are they afraid of?" <PARAGRAPH> Samuel told me that British and American unions today should look to the labor movement of Parsons' era as a model for more bold and militant tactics and more community involvement. He and Roger said the labor movement today is too disconnected from the community, lacking the deep local support that gave power to the railroad workers and also the coal miners who were on strike for a year in the United Kingdom in 1984. Samuel is a member of Britain’s national public health workers union, which, like U.S. public sector and health care unions, is under attack today. He said union health workers are seeing their jobs and pensions disappear as Britain shifts to a health care system more like that in the U.S. <PARAGRAPH> Along with raising Parson’s profile, Samuel and Roger said their presentation was also meant to remind people of the militancy of U.S. labor movements of the past. They spoke about the great Railroad Strike of 1877, which set the stage for the 1886 battle for the 8-hour-day and saw railroad workers and their families and neighbors blocking tracks across the industrial heartland and east coast. Roger noted that the workers, most of whom were not unionized, burned train stations, destroyed locomotives and fought back with arms against brutal crackdowns by militias, the National Guard and even federal troops in all-out violent confrontations. He said: <PARAGRAPH> The state response to the strike was absolutely vile…there was not much negotiation going on…they absolutely crushed the strike…But these workers were not victims, they took on the state with arms…it was a massive outbreak of class war. <PARAGRAPH> After the Lucy Parsons presentation, history group member Owen described the intriguing and mysterious life and work of journalist and itinerant laborer B. Traven, who won Oscars for the film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and much acclaim for books about workers, bandits and power struggles between the haves and have-nots, including The Cotton Pickers and The Ghost Ship. He noted that even as a well-known writer, Traven worked odd jobs, including driving cattle and manning an oil rig, and he always insisted that the typesetter who printed his work was just as important to the outcome as Traven was himself. <PARAGRAPH> In a culture obsessed with the latest exploits of the Kardashians or the cast of Jersey Shore, the lives of Parsons and Traven, as described by the history group members, are more fascinating, inspiring and provocative than any modern-day celebrity—not to mention their political and historical importance. While they will never be hot topics on TMZ or Twitter, through grassroots efforts like the Bristol Radical History Group and Charles H. Kerr (which also published Parsons' writings and speeches), hopefully more people will delve into these stories that are still highly relevant and vibrant today.
Youth Sex Workers Organize for Their Rights | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> When youth who live on the streets and work in the sex trade or other informal economies are victimized or abused, often the institutions that are supposed to help them—the police, hospitals and clinics, social service and non-profit agencies, homeless shelters—do more harm than good. <PARAGRAPH> A recent report by the Young Women's Empowerment Project in Chicago quantifies and analyzes this problem and describes and promotes a two-pronged solution wherein youth develop their own systems and networks for self-help and healing while also working with institutions to provide better services. <PARAGRAPH> YWEP youth leaders, who have a policy of not revealing their identities, worked together to answer my questions about this initiative. They said, "Institutions have so many rules and guidelines that prevent young people from even feeling comfortable in institutional atmospheres, it doesn't give them the room to grow. We don't dictate a young person's future and make decisions for them, we support them to make it on their own because we believe they know what they need to do to survive." <PARAGRAPH> The report notes that much of the bad treatment young people receive is related to the fact or supposition that they survive through sex work or other informal work on the street, combined with general prejudice toward LGBTQ and gender non-conforming youth. While many organizations dealing with sex workers aim to help them leave sex work, YWEP maintains that it is a valid individual choice and practices a harm reduction philosophy to help young people stay physically and emotionally safe and healthy no matter how they make a living. <PARAGRAPH> The youth leaders told me, "Through the work and programs at YWEP, we have all had individual experiences of developing new skills, making important relevant and positive changes in our lives and feeling like we have a place to call our own in a world that is adultist, racist, sexist and homophobic and threatens our daily existence." <PARAGRAPH> YWEP has launched a "Bad Encounter Line" or BEL project where youth can use forms, a phone line, blank zines or meetings with advocates to report specific bad experiences with institutions including police, health care and non-profit agencies. The report, which analyzes 146 of these reports since September 2009, shows that police received the most complaints, followed by health care agencies. The report is also based on incidents reported to advocates and staff wherein youth did not use the BEL structure. Almost all the reports came from youth of color, and transgender youth were disproportionately likely to have bad experiences. <PARAGRAPH> Horror stories included being arrested and-or sexually assaulted and harrassed by police when reporting a rape or other crime, or simply when standing on the street. Youth also reported a prevalent problem with being placed in psychiatric care against their will when reporting a crime or seeking health care. In some cases health professionals decided youth needed psychiatric care just because they are transgender, or because they had "too many sexual partners." One transgender youth reported being openly mocked by a nurse and patients at an emergency room, then denied entry to the emergency room (told it was "full"), because their name didn't match their appearance. Such experiences mean youth often don't seek medical attention at all when they need it. The YWEP leaders told me, "The constant oppressions create a lack of trust between the young people and the adults in the helping institutions ... A lot of adults that work in these agencies do not see the power or relevance of the youth voice. Because they are set up to help, a lot of people assume these agencies are doing good, even though they might actually be harming young people." <PARAGRAPH> The complaints about police included being told they could avoid arrest in exchange for sex, then often being arrested even if they did give in to the officers' demands. One girl reported being arrested after she ignored an officer saying "Come over here, girl with all that ass"—and told him that is not her name. Many complaints were also lodged about the Department of Children and Family Services, including that children were taken away immediately after birth if young mothers declined to give a father's name. <PARAGRAPH> The report notes that surprisingly few BEL complaints have been filed regarding non-profit agencies, given that they hear complaints about such agencies frequently; the report surmises that maybe youth feel less comfortable making a written complaint about such organizations. <PARAGRAPH> The highest number of BEL complaints came from Englewood, a very low-income African American neighborhood on the city's south side; and Lakeview, a relatively affluent neighborhood that is home base to many youth who live and work on the streets. <PARAGRAPH> The study describes the movement Street Youth Rising Up!, which focuses on empowering youth to stand up for their rights and to work together to provide for themselves some of the resources and care that they are not getting from institutions. The group has worked with the Chicago Women's Health Center to train youth in basic reproductive health care and self-exams, and also helps youth file grievances and demand their legal rights from government and other institutions. They note that these rights include the right to decide to live without a "traditional" home (defined as "home free") and to have as many sex partners as one chooses, as well as the right to make a living in informal economies  including the sex trade. <PARAGRAPH> YWEP has published a Street Youth Bill of Rights outlining such rights and how institutions can respect them, and they are asking institutional representatives to sign on and help them promote the movement. The BEL program also continues, creating a formal outlet to press for change from specific institutions and more generally, and also allowing youth to share practical advice (published in a zine) helping them to pragmatically navigate institutions. The YWEP leaders told me that a West side shelter is using the bill of rights to revise their housing contract and make it more youth-friendly, and organizations including the Broadway Youth Center, Sage Community Health Collective, Project Nia and the Chicago Women's Health Center have formally endorsed the bill of rights. <PARAGRAPH> They said, "We are organizing and building power. After we get 10 more organizations to endorse we will use our collective power to try to influence policy at an institutional or governmental level... We believe institutions will change when they are approached by young people who have first-hand experience in the street economy and by hearing our personal testimony of what the hell we have been through."
Police and Firefighters Unions Join List of Public Employees Targeted by Chicago Mayor Emanuel | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is picking his latest fight with unions representing public workers, though the political context is markedly different than his bitter stand-offs with the Chicago Teachers Union, AFSCME and SEIU. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel has provoked the ire of the firefighter and police unions by planning significant cuts in the firefighter union's next contract and refusing to pay police officers all the overtime they say are due related to the NATO summit in late May. These unions aren't traditionally allied with the city's other public sector unions, which were among the key organizers of protests during the NATO summit, where Chicago police were accused of using excessive force. <PARAGRAPH> While protest leaders circulated videos that they say show police mistreatment of protesters, city officials and business leaders proclaimed the city's handling of the summit a success and praised law enforcement. But the Fraternal Order of Police has filed four grievances related to the summit and overtime pay, charging that the city is not honoring their union contract or its promises in regards to paying 3,100 officers for overtime—part of a bill for taxpayers that is expected to be huge. Officers had their days off and furlough days cancelled over a two-week period and were ordered to work 12-hour days in preparation for and during the summit. <PARAGRAPH> The union is disputing how overtime was calculated, including for officers who worked six or seven days within a week. A city spokesperson has said officers will get all the overtime due them, with checks arriving in mid-June. <PARAGRAPH> On the FOP's website, union president Mike Shields wrote, "We protected the mayor's residence from anarchists. You'd think he could at least pay us what we are owed." <PARAGRAPH> On May 30, he told the Chicago Sun-Times, "The Chicago Police Department made Mayor Emanuel shine throughout the nation and the world. Yet he won't stand up for us and say, 'You guys had my back, I'm going to have yours.'" <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile the Chicago Firefighters Union contract is up June 30, and Emanuel has indicated cuts are in store for the next one as part of a move to reform the department. Emanuel's proposal reportedly calls for eliminating duty availability pay, bonuses for firefighters with cross-training as paramedics, and clothing allowances; and reducing the number of people per engine from 10 to 9. Union president Tom Ryan called the proposals "horrendous" and said Emanuel is using the word "reform" as a euphemism for "cuts." <PARAGRAPH> City Inspector General Joe Ferguson has said the city could save more than $50 million by eliminating extra pay for police and firefighters for being on call 24 hours a day, and an additional $50 million by reducing the required number of workers staffing a piece of fire equipment from five to four, in order to allow the staff cuts per engine. Altering the minimum staffing limit is what led to a firefighter strike in 1980, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Emanuel is also proposing significant changes to police and firefighter pension plans, including increasing employee contributions and raising the retirement age by five years. <PARAGRAPH> Firefighters have long been known for having extreme political clout and enjoying generous contracts and pension plans, even as the department was accused of racism and irresponsibility, with reports of parties involving prostitutes while firemen were on the clock during former Mayor Richard M. Daley's tenure. Last year an investigation by the Chicago News Cooperative found that the number of firefighters on the public payroll is proportionally the highest of any major city and is out of step with the steadily shrinking number of fires in Chicago. <PARAGRAPH> Many Chicagoans surely agree reforms of police and fire contracts and closer scrutiny of these departments are needed and timely, especially given the cost to taxpayers and widespread complaints about many police officers' behavior. But others see Emanuel's moves as a general signal of disrespect to unions and the collective bargaining process. Chicago's local ABC affiliate  The police demands for NATO overtime pay come as many residents are still vehemently questioning the priorities behind spending so much on the summit while services are being slashed and crime is epidemic in poor neighborhoods—with 10 people killed and more than 40 shot over Memorial Day weekend alone. <PARAGRAPH> In a scathing column in the June 1 Southwest News Herald, Ray Hanania attacked Emanuel's focus on the NATO summit and what it represents at the expense of regular people: <PARAGRAPH> "He did a masterful job of taking the NATO conference, which never should have been brought to Chicago, and making it look like Chicago has somehow become a better place because didn't replicate the 'police riot' that took place in 1968. Chicago is still the city that doesn't work, its narrow shoulders getting smaller and holding up fewer and fewer."
Pearls Along the Mississippi: An Unsung Labor Hero Gets Her Due | <PARAGRAPH> MUSCATINE, IOWA—Today the town of Muscatine, Iowa, which overlooks the Mississippi River, looks relatively inconspicuous—one of many working-class river towns with grassy parks abutting the flood-prone wide river, brick factories-turned-bars along the main street and ornate but peeling Victorian homes up on the hill. <PARAGRAPH> But there are hints of Muscatine’s illustrious past: a riverside sculpture of a man in a flatboat with clams surrounding his feet, raising two shellfish rakes above his head; the word “buttons” emblazoned in chipped paint on some of the old brick structures. In its heyday, this area produced an astounding one third of the buttons sold worldwide—shiny, delicate “pearl” buttons produced from shells of the wealth of clams and mussels that once filled this stretch of the Mississippi, where a bend taking it east-west (rather than north-south) calmed the current enough to allow the shellfish to proliferate. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The local button industry was started in 1891 by an enterprising German immigrant, John Fredrick Boepple, skilled in making buttons from sea shells, who brought his manual-operated button press machine to Muscatine and launched a quickly mushrooming industry. Soon thousands of men were collecting shellfish from the river and its tributaries, and thousands of women and teenagers turned them into glistening buttons sewed onto decorative small cards with names like Mermaid and Blue Bird. <PARAGRAPH> Pearl was the name for the shell interiors used to make the buttons, and it was also the name of a fiery young labor activist renowned in her time but relatively unknown in more recent decades. But she appears to be enjoying a resurgence of fame now. <PARAGRAPH> Industry spy turned crusading organizer <PARAGRAPH> Pearl McGill started working in the button factories as a teenager as a sort of spy for the industry, recruited by her uncle’s friend to see if workers were as “shiftless and lazy” as bosses suspected. More likely, many say, was that the company wanted her to report on union organizing activities. McGill was also trying to earn money to study to be a teacher. <PARAGRAPH> Though her job was to report to the button industry power brokers, young Pearl soon found herself sympathizing more with the workers. Soon she was an activist and prominent member of the Women's Trade Union League and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) helping to organize the button workers and also traveling around the heartland and the east coast to make speeches and play a key role in the famous textile workers strikes of 1912. <PARAGRAPH> The Muscatine button workers battled with politicians and bosses, with strikes, violence and intrigue common. All the drama ended several decades later when much-cheaper, similar-looking plastic buttons became available. The pearl button industry basically died, except for small demand for vintage buttons for designer clothing. <PARAGRAPH> (The industry's sharp decline was good news for native mussels and clams, which have been wiped out in many parts of the Mississippi River system, though efforts are underway to help restore them.) <PARAGRAPH> A free museum in Muscatine pays homage to McGill—who did end up getting a scholarship to study teaching, from fellow union activist Helen Keller—and to the role of socialism and unions in the button industry and the workplaces of that time. On my visit to the museum last week, the author of a new book about McGill—along with one of McGill’s now-elderly relatives—happened to be there. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffrey Copeland’s new book—"Shell Games: The Life and Times of Pearl McGill, Industrial Spy and Pioneer Labor Activist"—is a fictionalized take on McGill’s dramatic life, including her murder on the banks of the Mississippi River and the question of whether her union activities played a role in her killing, in 1924 when she was just 29. A jealous and unstable ex-husband was blamed. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile in recent years, others have published nonfiction accounts of McGill’s life, based in part on the young worker’s letters, including to her parents, who lived a simple, conservative country life on an Iowa farm. <PARAGRAPH> One of those letters, provided to the Iowa Women’s Archives by Kate Rousmaniere, said: <PARAGRAPH> The militia got out in the streets at Muscatine the other day to break the crowd away from one of the factories and some of the girls caught a solider boy up on fourth street and took his gun and cap and coat away from him and beat it. Ha! Ha! <PARAGRAPH> A play was also staged in the area in March, during Women’s History Month:  “Bread, Roses and Buttons: Pearl McGill and the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike,” written by Janet Schlapkohl at the University of Iowa Theater Arts Department. <PARAGRAPH> 100 years later, a Muscatine lockout <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile a dramatic and bitter labor conflict has played out in Muscatine in recent years, though without the prominence or massive community support of a century ago. For the past three years, about 300 union members with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union have been locked out of a corn products plant called Grain Processing Corp (GPC) on Muscatine’s river bank, which makes corn syrup, corn oil, corn-based alcohol and other products for the global market. <PARAGRAPH> Tattered signs supporting the locked-out workers still adorn the windows and porches of some local houses, but for the most part, after a burst of solidarity, the town has moved on. <PARAGRAPH> The UFCW workers were locked out after refusing to agree to a new contract that gave the family-owned company the right to replace them with nonunion contractors. Now the plant is indeed up and running with nonunion workers. The union continues to demand members’ right to go back to work, and they say safety and productivity have suffered since the new workers were brought in. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile the plant poses a health and environmental risk to nearby residents and a swath of the Mississippi River valley, since it emits high amount s of particulate matter that is linked to respiratory and cardiac disease. The emissions also contribute to the area being out of compliance with federal standards, meaning it is much harder for new job-creating industries to open if they would release any particulate. <PARAGRAPH> A community group has for the past several years been working to draw the connections between the labor issues and the environmental issues around GPC and other area industries, including filing a lawsuit against GPC and framing the struggle as an environmental justice fight. The group is called Clean Air Muscatine, so the acronym—fittingly evoking the town’s storied shellfish past—is CLAM.
