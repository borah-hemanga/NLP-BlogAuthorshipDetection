N.Y. Times covers CEO's role in BBC sex abuse scandal | The New York Times is up with a new story on Mark Thompson, the embattled former BBC head and incoming president and CEO of The New York Times Co. <paragraph> The article — "British Parliament Questions Former BBC Chief’s Role <hyperlink> "  — details the shift in public statements from Thompson regarding what and when he knew about the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse investigation. The Times, which sat down with the former BBC director general on Tuesday, also featured another interview in Wednesday's piece about his knowledge of the spiked ”Newsnight” program.  “At no point does either Caroline [Hawley, the journalist who told him of the investigation in 2011] or the senior news managers ever specify exactly what is in the ‘Newsnight,’ what lines of inquiry they’re adopting or what was alleged,” he told the Times. “There was no detail given at all. Neither before that period or after that period did anyone raise complaints. I knew about its existence. But I was told, however, the program decided to stop it.” <paragraph> "I was not given any detail of what the program had been investigating," he added. <paragraph> Thompson also noted that “I can’t remember one where I was notified or briefed. There wasn’t a single example of ‘Newsnight’ referring programs that they got so high that they were referred to the director general.” <paragraph> The article mentioned the parliamentary hearing Tuesday that "featured an uncomfortable and apologetic George Entwistle, the current director general" and detailed the letters sent from members regarding Thompson's role, including one from former BBC producer Roger Gale that said Thompson was paid “to, apparently, not know what was going on under his own roof.”  <paragraph> As for whether Thompson will testify, John Whittingdale, the chairman of the parliamentary committee that held the hearing told the Times, "At the moment, we’re told he had no knowledge of the ‘Newsnight’ investigation. If reasons arise to talk to him, we will do so."
