Tina Brown: 'The Zeitgeist was against Newsweek' | When Tina Brown looks back on her decision to take over Newsweek, “it just seems completely insane, actually,” she told New York Magazine. <paragraph> In a wide-ranging interview appearing in the Nov. 26 issue  <hyperlink> ,  Brown spoke about everything from the future of newsweeklies to who she supported in the 2012 election — “you know who I voted for” — to her friendship with The Huffington Post’s Arianna Huffington — “we shared some of the same boyfriends.” As for her start at Newsweek, Brown told Michael Kinsley she felt it was a “romantic gamble that there was still life to be had for” the newsweekly.  <paragraph> “We felt that for the Daily Beast—such a frisky digital brand—to have a print platform as well would be great,” the ex-Vanity Fair, ex-New Yorker, ex-Talk editor said. “And, actually, that proved to be true. But every piece of the Zeitgeist was against Newsweek, combined with an unfixable infrastructure and a set of challenges that really would have required five years in an up economy to solve.” <paragraph>  And the future is a metered-access model, she said, with Newsweek charging readers for every fourth or fifth piece. Other magazines will soon follow Newsweek and move online, Brown, who announced in October that Newsweek would cease publishing  <hyperlink> at the end of this year and move to an all-digital format, predicted.  <paragraph>  “I think a lot of magazines are going to have to go online. There will be magazines, but a lot of magazines are going to decide that with basic, inherent costs, the fact that advertisers want to now be in digital, combined with the reading habits of all of us—they’ll decide that print doesn’t make any sense,” Brown said. <paragraph> And her decision to take on Newsweek "just seems completely insane" to her now, she said. <paragraph> “Within the first few months, one of the partners dies—before we’d even really gotten the office straight. I came into a situation where pretty much every senior member of management had departed,” she noted. <paragraph> Not to mention that the magazine cost $42 million to print even before any staff salaries, she said. <paragraph> “That was the thing,” Brown said. “We just looked at it in the spring, and everything, every trend, suggested this was never going to change. It’s not like you felt it was a temporary advertising situation.” And while she had envisioned that Newsweek could take after European newsmagazines with their “energetic, high-low approach to news,” Newsweek’s poor advertising sales made that impossible, Brown said. "There’s something about the way a magazine looks and feels when it doesn’t have advertising that is unbelievably disappointing, both as an editor and as a writer,” she said. <paragraph> Brown also reflected on the very different world of Newsweek in its heyday — “when I looked at the document of sale, it was like the vestiges of the great galleon it had been. It was like that wreck of the Titanic, in the James Cameron film” — but said the magazine still has a “great deal of access and power.” <paragraph> “And I think we’ve done a very good magazine,” she told Kinsley. “I don’t know whether you’ve been reading it—probably not—but it’s very good. There was a lot of talent here. But it’s like having a refrigerator on each foot—to have this carapace of the print magazine and all its problems, and all its legacy of unsolved issues. Once we shed that, we’ll just be able to focus on the content. I find that very liberating, personally. I think many of the staff do, too.” <paragraph> In the interview, Brown also defended herself against various accusations Kinsley posed — that she only cares about “buzz,” hasn’t made money for any of the publications she has run and that her only role is paying lots of money to big-name writers. <paragraph> Kinsley also offered an “observation” that “Tina has a thing for older men. And older men have a thing for Tina.” “Do you feel you have a special connection with older men?” he asked. <paragraph> “I certainly feel I have a special connection with the one I’m married to,” she said, as Kinsley jumped in to press her again on his “observation.” <paragraph> “You go to war with the army you have,” Brown replied. “Please. Let’s not talk about me having things for Si Newhouse and Harvey Weinstein. I enjoyed working for both of them, even Harvey.” <paragraph> The interview ended with a look four years into the future, to the 2016 election: Brown said she’d throw her full support behind Hillary Clinton. <paragraph> “Citizen Tina—thanks for that—would hike across America for Hillary. I’ve seen her up close in action in our Women in the World events, and she’s so unbelievably compelling. I want her to get her two years off, cut her hair again, freshen up those old pantsuits, and hit the trail running,” Brown said.
