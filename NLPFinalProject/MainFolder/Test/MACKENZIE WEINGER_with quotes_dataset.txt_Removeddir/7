Sulzberger: BBC scandal 'hasn’t made things easy' | New York Times Co. chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said chief executive Mark Thompson's connection to the BBC's Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal "hasn’t made things easy," according to a report. <paragraph> “The British stuff hasn’t made things easy,” Sulzberger told Bloomberg News <hyperlink> on Tuesday night. “But Mark is a good man.” <paragraph>  Thompson, who is facing questions over his role at the BBC concerning the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal <hyperlink> , started his new gig at the Times on Nov. 12. Sulzberger, who did not elaborate on the "British stuff," added that he was pleased to finally have the CEO position filled, Bloomberg News reported. “We are very happy to have him in the position after all that time,” he said. <paragraph>  Controversy continues to swirl around Thompson, formerly BBC director general, who has said he was not involved <hyperlink>  in killing the BBC “Newsnight” investigation into Savile. He has said he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being spiked, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011.
