Hannity's immigration evolution draws praise from conservative Latino group | Sean Hannity’s announcement that he has “evolved” on immigration is drawing praise from a conservative Latino organization. <paragraph> Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, on Friday applauded Hannity for telling his radio listeners he now supports a pathway to citizenship for those in the United States without criminal records. <paragraph> “Sean Hannity has taken a bold step and conservatives are behind him. It is time to allow the market — rather than a bureaucratic federal government — to determine our immigration policy,”  <hyperlink> Aguilar said, according to a press release. <paragraph> “The tidal wave of support for real reform is growing,”  <hyperlink> Aguilar said. <paragraph> “There is a growing momentum within the conservative movement to embrace a market-based immigration plan that is in line with Ronald Reagan, who said it best:  ‘No regulation or law should be allowed if it results in crops rotting in the fields for lack of harvesters,’”  <hyperlink> Aguilar noted. <paragraph> In the wake of the GOP's failure to attract the Latino vote in the 2012 election, Hannity on Thursday said the United States needs to “get rid of the immigration issue altogether.”  <hyperlink> <paragraph> “I think you control the border first,"  <hyperlink> he said. "You create a pathway for those people that are here — you don’t say you’ve got to go home. And that is a position that I’ve evolved on. Because, you know what, it’s got to be resolved."
