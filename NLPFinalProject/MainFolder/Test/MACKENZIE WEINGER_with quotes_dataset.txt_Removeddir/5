Media: Obama in fighting mood | Top journalists and pundits reviewing the debate said Monday night it was clear President Barack Obama had come to the final faceoff spoiling for a fight with Mitt Romney, while the Republican nominee sought to fend off the attacks and maintain his momentum. <paragraph> “I thought in the middle of the debate that if I had been on the desert island for the last four years and I had just been parachuted into this debate, I would have thought the guy that had turned out to be Mitt Romney was the president protecting a lead and that Barack Obama was the challenger trying, somewhat desperately to catch up,” Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace said. “Obama was slashing, was personal, was cutting.” <paragraph>  His Fox News colleague Brit Hume agreed, saying that Obama had a “very intent look on his face” like a “man looking for opportunities to strike.” <paragraph> On CNN, Candy Crowley, the moderator of the second presidential debate, said the candidates had two very different objectives tonight: Obama came to “rough up” Romney, while the Republican was seeking to preserve his new-found momentum. <paragraph>  “I think the president came to rough up Mitt Romney,” Crowley said. “I think he acted like a person that had to sort of stop some momentum by Romney. He went after him — ‘you’re all over the map, that’s not what you said before’ — I mean, almost every single answer from the president had something to do with Mitt Romney. I feel as though Mitt Romney approached this like a physician, first do no harm. I feel like he didn’t come in to necessarily win. I think he came in, you know, as a man who’s had a certain amount of momentum over the past three, four weeks since that first debate and not wanting to ruin it.” <paragraph>  NBC’s David Gregory also described the debate in terms of the president angling for a battle. The president was “determined to pick a fight” with Romney, who was “surprisingly, determined to avoid a fight, playing almost as if he was ahead, determined to sound more moderate, to disagree less with the president on foreign policy,” said the “Meet the Press” host. <paragraph> CNN’s Wolf Blitzer noted that except for a few “rhetorical flourishes,” there wasn’t much difference between the two candidates on foreign policy, he said. <paragraph> “This was a debate where they wound up agreeing, even though there were nuances of disagreement, they wound up basically in terms of the big picture agreeing on a lot, on Iran, on Israel, on Afghanistan Libya, Syria, even on China, basically the thrust was one of agreement, even though at times they had little rhetorical flourishes against each other,” Blitzer said. <paragraph> The Atlantic’s James Fallows also pointed out the similarities between the two candidates on foreign policy, writing that “it was more striking as a matter of substance that on virtually no issue did Romney make an actual criticism, of any sort, of Obama’s policy or record. Including topics where he used to disagree, like the timeline for withdrawal for Afghanistan! Instead it was, ‘I agree, but you should have done it better.’” <paragraph>  Meanwhile MSNBC’s Chris Matthews said Romney “had a strategy tonight — avoiding looking like a radical.” <paragraph> “Avoiding the statements he’s made throughout the primaries and caucuses that put him on the far right, in terms of looking a bit dangerous. He pulled back, pulled back, pulled back,” the “Hardball” host said. <paragraph> And his MSNBC colleague Ed Schultz called the debate a win for Obama and blasted Romney as giving the “worst performance of any Republican candidate on foreign policy that I can ever remember.”
