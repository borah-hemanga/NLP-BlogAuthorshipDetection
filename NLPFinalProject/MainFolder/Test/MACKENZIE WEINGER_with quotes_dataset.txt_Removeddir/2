Huckabee to pundits: Put up or shut up | Mike Huckabee on Thursday laid out a challenge to the pundits who are now criticizing Mitt Romney’s campaign: “If you’re so doggone good at this, when will we see your name on the ballot?”  <paragraph> “I’m just so tired of the people who have never actually gotten in the game of politics trying to figure out what went wrong,” he said on “The Mike Huckabee Show” Thursday afternoon. “And I’m going to challenge, if you're one of those people — you may even be a host of a radio show — if you're so doggone good at this, when will we see your name on the ballot? I’m just curious if you’ll let me know, because I want to sit back and watch to see how it ought to be done.”  <paragraph>  For those that have never been in the political arena to think they understand how to run a campaign, Huckabee said, just shows the “level of ignorance” among political pundits. <paragraph> “So I say come out of the stands, put your jacket aside where it’s nice and warm, get down on the field, take a few hits upside the head, come off the field with your own blood pouring out of your body, several of your bones broken, and tell me what a great, great genius approach you had to the whole process,” Huckabee said. <paragraph> The former Arkansas governor also reflected on his own political career, noting that each time someone offered him advice on how to win, he felt tempted to respond sarcastically. <paragraph> “No, I really don’t want to win, because then you have to work and you have a job to do,” Huckabee said he would want to tell his critics. “I just want to run to run because it’s so much fun coming out here, getting up at four in the morning every morning and running until well past midnight, living off hot cokes and cold pizza, eating every meal you have for two years out of a paper sack while on the way to yet another campaign event. So, no, I really don’t want to win the election, I just enjoy this extraordinary process of having the tar beaten out of me by newspapers, editorial cartoonists, by opponents and their negative ads.” <paragraph>
