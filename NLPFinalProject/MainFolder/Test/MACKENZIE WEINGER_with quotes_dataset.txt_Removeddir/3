Al Gore: Voter suppression like 'racist Jim Crow tactics' | Al Gore said Tuesday on Current TV that the attempt this cycle to stop people from voting has been "un-American" and a "disgrace," adding that it is a “strategy that is a direct descendent" of "racist Jim Crow tactics.” <paragraph> Gore, who co-founded the left-leaning cable channel, said he hopes there will be a "reckoning for these governors and state legistures that have intentionally tried to prevent people from voting. It is un-American." The problem — which he said included the long lines facing many voters, particularly in Florida — must be addressed in a bipartisan way after the election. <paragraph> “It is a strategy that is a direct descendent of the racist Jim Crow tactics that were used in the wake of the Civil War to prevent black people from voting. It’s more sophisticated now, it’s dressed up in different kinds of language, but it is un-American,” he said. “It is wrong. It is a disgrace to this country. And there ought to be a bipartisan movement to say, enough of this. We have the ability to let everyone who is eligible to vote without standing in line for eight hours, without having their names stricken wrongly from the voting rolls. And this is something that ought to be a bipartisan agenda after this election.”
