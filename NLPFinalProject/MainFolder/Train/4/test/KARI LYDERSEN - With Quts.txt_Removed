Airports Go Green … And, Labor Leaders Fear, Bust Unions | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Outside the Westin River North hotel in downtown Chicago on Nov. 5, about 20 men and women in winter clothes stood quietly facing the entrance, handing out fliers. They read, “Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Stop Eliminating GOOD JOBS” and implored people to call the mayor and “tell him to keep our airport CLEAN & SAFE, and our families STRONG.” <PARAGRAPH> Inside the hotel, Emanuel was presiding over the fifth annual Airports Going Green conference, where airport and airline executives from around the world were discussing the latest in sustainable airport management, including aviation biofuel development, electric vehicles, recycled asphalt, community volunteer days and LED flight information screens. Emanuel told the crowd that investment in energy efficiency and sustainability at airports like Chicago’s O’Hare and Midway makes sense because it “creates jobs.”  <PARAGRAPH> But the flierers outside the hotel represented more than 300 janitors who fear they will lose their jobs at O’Hare International Airport. The previous week, the city signed a contract with a new subcontractor to replace Scrub, which currently employs the airport janitors. United Maintenance Company, which won the contract, reportedly submitted a bid to the city’s aviation department promising to do the work for $11 million less than Scrub, a difference of about 10 percent. United Maintenance is not required to hire the people who worked for Scrub, and if they do it will likely be at lower wages, weaker benefits and without union representation. <PARAGRAPH> Tom Balanoff, president of SEIU Local 1 (which represents all 330 of the janitors at O'Hare), believes the new contractor will try to thwart any efforts by the janitors to unionize. He tells Working In These Times that United Maintenance head Roger Simon specifically told him they would not recognize SEIU Local 1 and that Simon indicated starting wages will be $12 an hour, considerably lower than the $15 an hour many are making with Scrub. <PARAGRAPH> SEIU Local 1 finds the cost-cutting in the janitorial contracts especially frustrating because the city does not save any money. The janitorial funds don’t come out of the general city budget, but rather are covered through fees paid by airlines. Moreover, the city rejected bids by several union contractors who like Scrub also recognize SEIU Local 1 and would pay union wages. (They are covered by the union's master contract.) <PARAGRAPH> “This is simply a way to bust the union,” Balanoff said. “And it’s the wrong direction to be going in.” <PARAGRAPH> SEIU Local 1 represents janitors, window washers, security guards and others who work for private contractors in city buildings. While the airport janitorial jobs have been privatized for a number of years, Balanoff would like to see them made public again—with workers directly hired by the city—even though that would mean Local 1 losing members to SEIU Local 73, which represents city employees. <PARAGRAPH> The janitors outside weren’t the only labor representatives at the Airports Going Green conference. Later that afternoon, panelists discussed greening airport concessions, such as restaurants and snack shops. Steve Dietz, business manager of Food Donation Connection, spoke about his company's work facilitating donations of unsold food to hunger relief agencies. Dietz noted that concessions workers are big boosters of the program and take home unsold food themselves. <PARAGRAPH> During the Q&A, Don Lydon, an analyst for UNITE HERE Local 1 stood and said, ”Workers will be at the forefront of implementing these sustainable business practices … so do you think we need to make these sustainable jobs with living wages, so they’re not relying on food donations?” <PARAGRAPH> Dietz seemed caught off guard and answered, “We don’t control what people pay … we only have 40 people in our company … I would agree with that … but unfortunately I don’t know … Who controls all that?” <PARAGRAPH> It’s true Dietz and his organization have no power over what huge companies running airport concessions pay their workers; however, the city aviation department and the city council do, through the contracts with concessionaires. <PARAGRAPH> UNITE HERE Local 1 represents about 1,300 concessions workers at O’Hare and Midway. The union has long been pushing the city council to close a loophole exempting airport concessions from the city’s living wage policy, which mandates private contractors working for the city pay their workers the city living wage of $11.53 an hour. (Meanwhile, critics including Balanoff argue that $11.53 isn’t truly a living wage in Chicago.) <PARAGRAPH> Just two weeks before the conference, about 1,200 workers at O'Hare concessionaire HMS Host signed a union contract with the company that would increase their wages and benefits significantly, to above the living wage. But at the same time they celebrated this victory, they worried they would lose their jobs—or at least their newfound raises—in coming months. HMS Host’s contract with the city expired over the summer, and city officials have said they will be accepting new bids over the winter. Like the janitors, the concessions workers could lose their jobs or be rehired at lower wages if the city chooses a non-union contractor. <PARAGRAPH> In theory, either the city council or the aviation department—which decides which bids to recommend to the council—could require that bidders have fair labor practices. UNITE HERE has for some time been pushing the city council to adopt an ordinance called Stable Jobs, Stable Airports, which would mandate any new company rehire existing workers for at least a 90 day trial period and ensure “labor peace,” giving workers a fair chance to organize with a union. In October, hundreds of Chicagoans including prominent pastors and aldermen had joined airport concessions workers at the Chicago Temple downtown, calling for the ordinance’s passage and the renewal of HMS Host’s contract. <PARAGRAPH> “It’s the airport workers who make the sustainable food,” UNITE HERE organizer Chris Williams tells Working In These Times. Williams works for a sushi shop at O’Hare airport, and he said employees like himself take pride in making quality, healthy food and participating in recycling and other sustainability programs. “Like Rahm Emanuel said here, going green and creating jobs goes hand-in-hand. These things are not diametrically opposed. The employees are pushing for the same things as the city, they should recognize that.”
New Contract Spells Good News for 1,200 Chicago Airport Workers—Unless City Moots It | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> On Oct. 19, after four months of bargaining, UNITE HERE Local 1 union ratified a contract ensuring better wages and health insurance for 1,200 store, café and restaurant workers at Chicago’s two airports, O'Hare and Midway. The new contract with company HMS Host will put a total of $10 million more in airport workers’ pockets, which means $10 million more circulating in the working-class Chicago neighborhoods where many of them live, says UNITE HERE Local 1 president Henry Tamarin. <PARAGRAPH> But the contract could become moot if the Chicago Department of Aviation, which administers the airports, decides to hire different companies for the concessions contracts up for renewal this fall. The department is currently conducting bidding on three-quarters of the food and retail contracts at O’Hare and Midway airports, worth around $250 million annually, according to UNITE HERE. If new contractors are hired, they could lay off up to 1,500 existing workers (including those in Local 1) and bring in new workers at lower wages, without union representation. <PARAGRAPH> That’s why union leaders, workers, pastors and a handful of Chicago aldermen are calling for passage of the Stable Jobs, Stable Airports ordinance. The ordinance mandates a living wage for airport concessions workers and requires new contractors to hire existing workers for a trial period of 90 days. It would close what the union calls a “loophole” in the city’s Living Wage Ordinance, which mandates a living wage of $11.53 an hour for other contractors on city jobs, but does not apply to airport concessions. <PARAGRAPH> Hundreds of workers and their supporters met at the Chicago Temple on Tuesday morning and then held a rally on the second floor of City Hall, calling on the aldermen on the city council’s aviation committee to move the ordinance forward. <PARAGRAPH> Tameka Shivers, who spoke at the gathering, has been working at O’Hare through HMS Host for six years. She has three kids, including an 8-year-old with Down’s Syndrome and a 3-year-old who is a carrier for sickle cell disease, making health insurance unaffordable. <PARAGRAPH> “I make $10.50 an hour, which is not a living wage here in Chicago, but due to the new victory which we won last week, in a year I’ll be making a living wage,” she told the crowd at the temple. “This is a huge victory not only for me but for my family and my coworkers and their families as well. I will be able to move my kids into a safe neighborhood … and with the new contract I will be able to afford health insurance.” <PARAGRAPH> When the ordinance goes up for a vote, she said, “I’m calling on all the aldermen to remember me—remember this beautiful single mother who has been fighting for security for her children.” <PARAGRAPH> Aida Olavarria, 62, started working at a restaurant at O’Hare International Airport 25 years ago, after selling the small grocery store on Chicago’s northwest side that she had owned for 16 years. Like the grocery store, her restaurant cashier job gives her the chance to interact with people all day, so she enjoys it even though the wages are low and she is often rushing to do several jobs at once–delivering salads and condiments while she is supposed to be working the register. Since she helps support her daughter and grandson, getting by is a struggle. <PARAGRAPH> “When you have to pay the rent, the groceries, the car, health insurance, and some people have kids to send to college, these days it is too hard,” she tells Working In These Times. “These companies make good money, they could pay us a little more.” <PARAGRAPH> Aldermen speaking at the temple referred to their own immigrant and working class family histories in describing the ripple effect of decent jobs in building strong communities. Alderman Danny Solis described his Mexican immigrant father working three jobs while his mother worked at a Laundromat. Alderman Tim Cullerton, a union member for 42 years, noted that his family came to Chicago during the Irish potato famine. <PARAGRAPH> “We started working on the Illinois Michigan canal in the mud and the muck—we had to buy our shovels from the company store, we had to buy our food from the company store—but that job gave us our dignity,” he said of the family history. He said economic conditions in the northwest part of the city he represents are the toughest he’s ever seen them. “We have the highest foreclosure rates I have seen…when I’m campaigning, many people aren’t home on weekends and nights—they are out working two or three jobs, trying to hold on to their homes. We’re not asking for a handout, we’re not asking for a bailout, we’re just asking for some dignity and living wages.” <PARAGRAPH> Peggy Willis has worked for seven years at a Starbucks at O’Hare, and she said she has regular customers who know she will have their favorite drinks ready for them. She is counting on the job to put her three-year-old son Jeremiah through college. “He will go to college no matter what,” she said. <PARAGRAPH> As David Moberg reported for Working In These Times last March, UNITE HERE Local 1 now represents about 1,300 out of 2,300 total airport concession workers, thanks to years of organizing. But new concessions could gut their efforts and mean lower wages across the board. <PARAGRAPH> Academic studies have shown that paying all Chicago airport concession workers a living wage would mean up to $8 million annually in extra wages, and that 18 other major airports have policies similar to the proposed airport ordinance, including LAX, JFK, LaGuardia, Miami, San Francisco, Seattle, Newark, San Diego and Cleveland. A similar ordinance was introduced in Chicago last year but never passed; now it’s on the city council docket again. Citizen Action Illinois co-director William McNary said the price increases needed to pay workers a living wage are minimal. <PARAGRAPH> “This is not going to cost people a whole lot of money,” he said. “To add either 16 or 19 cents to that hamburger so workers can have a living wage, so Peggy can think about her son going to college. We’re not asking to break the bank, we’re asking the people who make millions to give up nickels.”
Illinois Unions Fight Prison Closures | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> In Illinois, the battle over slated prison closings is highlighting how unions that represent prison guards can find themselves at odds with the push to reform a discriminatory and overly punitive criminal-justice system. Several prisons and juvenile detention facilities are currently scheduled for closing as part of Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn’s attempts to close the state’s budget hole. But AFSCME, the public sector union representing guards and other correctional workers, says that closing these facilities will cause overcrowding and dangerous conditions at other institutions. <PARAGRAPH> One of the prisons slated for closure is Tamms, a controversial super-max facility in southern Illinois that has long been the target of a shutdown campaign by family members and activists. For years, many demanded Tamms be closed because of the harsh solitary confinement conditions and the documented extreme physical and mental impacts on inmates. It appears that what these human-rights arguments did not achieve, the budget crisis now has. <PARAGRAPH> But prison guards and union leaders say the closure of Tamms, Dwight (the state’s only women’s prison) and transitional facilities will make conditions more dangerous and difficult for prison workers. and by extension, for inmates. <PARAGRAPH> According to prison-reform advocates, Illinois’s system is designed for 34,000 inmates but currently holds more than 48,000, forcing inmates to bunk in hallways and closets. Increasing crowding and mixing in new people with various gang affiliations could be an explosive mix, AFSCME has noted. <PARAGRAPH> State officials disagree, as reported by the Chicago Tribune: <PARAGRAPH> “The Illinois Department of Corrections, however, argues that there is ‘no statistical relationship between population, staffing levels or closures, and violence.’ The department released data showing inmate assaults on guards dropped from 502 to 444 during the budget year that ended June 30.” <PARAGRAPH> Another point worth noting is that inmate numbers may decrease in the long term. Crime is declining in general, and more state and local governments are moving toward alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent crimes and toward decriminalizing minor marijuana charges. <PARAGRAPH> Because of the rift between unions and the state on this issue, the union says, the Illinois State Police have retaliated against union prison guards at Tamms by searching them with pat-downs at the end of shifts, among other things. The searches allegedly started in July, right after guards testified at the state capital about the risks of prison closings and inmate transfers, according to AFSCME. Union spokesperson Anders Lindall says the searches “reek of retaliatory harassment.” <PARAGRAPH> The maximum-security prisoners from Tamms will be transferred to other prisons, including Pontiac and Menard in southern Illinois. Cells will be upgraded at a cost of as much as $50,000 each to accommodate the maximum-security prisoners.
NLRB Rules In Favor of Chicago’s Columbia College Professors | <PARAGRAPH> Unionized part-time faculty at Columbia College in Chicago gained a major victory, union leaders say, when the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a ruling about the way classes are assigned and the administration’s failure to turn over requested documents that shed light on the process. <PARAGRAPH> In years past, experienced part-time faculty at the arts and media-focused college in downtown Chicago typically could expect to teach the same classes year after year, in a process known as “rollover.” But around 2010, according to P-fac (Part-Time Faculty Association at Columbia College) President Diana Vallera, senior part-time faculty were not being assigned to expected classes, often finding them given to newly hired part-timers. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> “If you’ve been there some time you have certain expectations of income, and you rely on that income,” Vallera says. “It was devastating for a lot of our members—especially since those classes were still available.” <PARAGRAPH> This is among several issues being debated in contentious negotiations stretching since the union’s last four-year contract expired in 2010, and was indefinitely extended. For eight months, according to the union, administrators have refused to meet with them, so bargaining has been at a stalemate. <PARAGRAPH> On July 17 NLRB administrative law judge Robert A. Ringler ruled in favor of the union on unfair labor practice charges related to the rollovers and documents requested by the union to analyze how the school was assigning classes. The NLRB found that the actual class assignment policy was not an issue that could be covered by bargaining, but the impact of the change on union members is subject to bargaining. The judge also said the administration must turn over the documents the union requested. <PARAGRAPH> Columbia College declined to respond to specific questions for this story, and sent a statement: <PARAGRAPH> We strongly disagree with the Administrative Law Judge’s decision and will continue to make those objections through the appropriate processes. Columbia has always engaged in good faith bargaining and will continue to do so. Our focus remains on the educational and financial well-being of our students, along with the vitality and quality of the College itself. <PARAGRAPH> Vallera says the hiring of new part-time teachers instead of senior adjuncts is unfair to students as well as teachers. <PARAGRAPH> “These are faculty with lots of experience,” she says. “This is about not valuing their faculty, but it’s also about what’s best for students and student learning.” <PARAGRAPH> Vallera says it is unclear exactly why the administration is replacing senior instructors with newer ones or administrators—“we’re seeing deans teaching classes.” It is likely a cost-saving measure and possibly also a move to reduce the union’s power as the contract negotiations drag on. <PARAGRAPH> “Maybe they’re trying to negatively affect the membership by having our senior members losing classes, but if so that backfired because senior members were upset and came to the union and got involved,” Vallera says. <PARAGRAPH> Vallera hopes the decision will mean renewed negotiations between the college and the part-timers union, which has about 900 members. She says school officials have offered to meet with the union every three weeks for two hours, but union leaders don’t think that is sufficient given that past negotiations were held for at least three hours every week. <PARAGRAPH> “I think this kind of decision is a step in the right direction and has gotten people involved in bargaining,” Vallera says. “Hopefully they will bargain in good faith at this point, not just on the effects of these changes because they’re forced to but also on the contract. Hopefully we won’t have to take further action on that.” <PARAGRAPH> Judge Ringler chided the administration for failing to turn over documents and information requested by the union in December 2010, including lists of adjuncts whose classes were canceled and reasons for class assignment switches.  <PARAGRAPH> The ruling says: <PARAGRAPH> In addition to an employer's duty to provide necessary and relevant information, “an unreasonable delay in furnishing such information is as much a violation of the Act as a refusal to furnish the information at all. <PARAGRAPH> The NLRB also ordered 18 part-timers with classes canceled must be paid the equivalent of a three-credit course, with interest, about $4,700. The ruling said: <PARAGRAPH> Meaningful bargaining cannot be assured until some measure of economic strength is restored to the Union; a bargaining order alone, therefore, cannot serve as an adequate remedy for the unfair labor practices committed.
New York Cabbies Celebrate | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> NEW YORK CITY – “It’s about time,” said a New York City cab driver while weaving efficiently through afternoon traffic in Midtown on Monday. It had been several days since the New York Taxi Workers Alliance logged a major victory with a commission vote that grants drivers a 17 percent fare hike and what the group is calling the first ever Health and Disability Fund for drivers, paid for through a surcharge on every ride. The ordinance also ends the 5 percent loss that drivers previously absorbed every time a passenger used a credit card. <PARAGRAPH> On July 12 the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission voted 6-2 (with one abstention) to adopt the fare hike and other measures, which were backed by Mayor Michael M. Bloomberg, many city councilmen and organized labor allies of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents about a third of the city’s 48,500 drivers. <PARAGRAPH> The driver, an immigrant who declined to give his name, did not seem overly enthusiastic about the vote, noting that driving will still be a grueling profession where he expects rising gas prices to continue to make things difficult. He did not think the higher fares would result in any fewer people taking cabs in New York City, where cabs are of course ubiquitous and absolutely central to daily business and social life. Especially in Lower Manhattan, where relatively few people have cars, cabs make up a huge percentage of the vehicles on the street, and the threat of a cab drivers strike carries much weight. <PARAGRAPH> The New York Taxi Workers Alliance framed the commission vote as an historic “David vs. Goliath” victory, noting that they were up against powerful owners of large taxi companies, who under this plan don’t get a proportional share of the increased income drivers are likely to earn. <PARAGRAPH> The New York Times quoted a spokesman for the Metropolitan New York Taxicab Board of Trade who said the group might take legal action to overturn the fare hike. The Board, which represents 33 of the fleet garages that employ the majority of the city’s drivers, had previously sought a 20 percent fare increase, but only if the lease cap that fleet owners can charge drivers was also raised 20 percent. <PARAGRAPH> The Taxi Workers Alliance website says: <PARAGRAPH> Our better tomorrow was ultimately won because of the organizing and sacrifices of our membership who packed the hearing rooms, participated in studies, raised public consciousness and refused to give up the pursuit for justice. Hearing after hearing after protest after press conference after general meeting, NYTWA members stood strong, resilient, had the courage to negotiate and withstood intimidation and relentlessness from powerful opponents. <PARAGRAPH> Fleet owners have charged that political retaliation, rather than concern for drivers’ well-being, motivated the mayor’s and other elected officials’ support of the fare increase. The taxi industry had successfully blocked Bloomberg’s attempt to demand livery drivers that serve far-flung parts of the city be licensed to pick up people hailing them on the street. <PARAGRAPH> Currently people must call for such livery cabs. Requiring new medallions for up to 18,000 of these cabs could have generated $1 billion a year in revenue, according to the mayor’s office, with 20 percent of the vehicles required to be wheelchair-accessible.  The state legislature had approved Bloomberg’s plan last fall as a statewide matter after city council shot it down. But in response to lawsuits from the taxicab board, a state Supreme Court justice ruled the city council does have jurisdiction over the issue, and negated the state legislation. <PARAGRAPH> Many yellow cab drivers, along with fleet owners, were opposed to the livery street-hail licenses, arguing it would cut into their business and decrease the value of medallions held by driver-owners. The New York Times noted that it could also hurt retired drivers who lease their medallions to help make ends meet, including for covering healthcare expenses. <PARAGRAPH> The yellow cab fare increase means the cost of rides to the city’s airports could rise notably, from about $45 to $52 for a ride from Manhattan to JFK International Airport. Several New Yorkers waiting for the private Airporter bus from Manhattan to LaGuardia on Tuesday said they regularly debate whether to take the $12.50 bus or a much quicker but more expensive cab. A fare increase might make the difference. <PARAGRAPH> I asked a driver waiting for a woman to stumble out of his cab on Bleecker Street at night what he thought of the fare increase. As the passenger apparently struggled to find enough change in her purse to cover the fare, he didn’t answer me directly but said with dry humor, “This is our life.” <PARAGRAPH> CBS quoted driver Qaiser Hashmi, who said the fare increase could change his life, compensating for the way he’s been squeezed by an escalating cost of living since the drivers’ last fare hike eight years ago: “I wouldn’t call it luxury, but at least I’ll be able to live a comfortable life.” <PARAGRAPH> The New York victory will likely inspire organized Chicago cab drivers, who are battling with Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration—including the use of short weekly strikes— for fare increases and a roll-back of new rules which they say gut their ability to make a living, as Jeremy Gantz reported for Working In These Times. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, as Michelle Chen recently reported for Working In These Times, New York cab drivers have been unfairly swept up in campaigns against sex trafficking, potentially forcing cab drivers to profile people based on their attire and actually making sex work even more dangerous. Chen wrote: <PARAGRAPH> Taxi drivers are vulnerable to violent attacks, punishing work schedules, and a labor structure that forces drivers into virtual vehicular serfdom. The city's anti-prostitution crackdown ironically does place prostitutes and cabbies on the same side of the law, but for reasons probably not anticipated by the City Council: both sex workers and taxi drivers have seen their labor devalued and tarred with stereotypes of criminality, when in reality they’re just, like most other New Yorkers, trying to make an honest living.
Irish Farmers Say Shell Oil Operations Bring Injustice, Not Jobs | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> POLLATHOMAS, IRELAND—This remote peninsula on Ireland's west coast is known as a bastion of beauty and serenity, at least for those who don't mind persistent rain and chilly winds driving waves against the stunning rocky cliffs and unspoiled sand dunes. But for years the peninsula that is home to the tiny town of Pollathomas has also been the site of a battle over the ownership of natural resources and the old jobs-versus-environment debate, as the company Shell and corporate partners are seeking to exploit the lucrative Corrib gas field under the ocean 60 kilometers off shore. <PARAGRAPH> Two decades after interest in the gas field was piqued, locals and resident solidarity activists continue to fight against Shell's plans to build a gas terminal on the coast of the peninsula. Signs along the one narrow quiet country road tracing the promontory's circumference read, "No Consent," "Shell Out" and "No Haulage." The beauty of the beaches spilling into mud flats below dramatic hills has been marred by Shell's industrial operations. Gardai (police) in fluorescent green vests ply the road in vehicles and stand around on foot—more police on a several-mile stretch of road than I saw in several weeks in the rest of the country. Private security contractors also work the area. <PARAGRAPH> Along the road, a hand-painted sign and tangled barbed wire mark the entrance to the Rossport Solidarity Camp—an outpost of ardent opponents of gas exploitation. Many Irish towns have welcome signs noting that the town is "twinned" with sister cities elsewhere in Europe. The camp sign says it is "twinned with Niger Delta and Gulf of Mexico." Bikes rest throughout the camp, and tents made of heavy military canvas are fortified against the constant rain. <PARAGRAPH> Up the road from the camp a local activist traipsing the road in barefeet despite the chill pauses to move a dead rat gently into the bushes and later checks on a sheep entangled in a fence. He explains the splits in the movement against Shell, wherein some opponents are open to negotiations if Ireland gets a better deal or the terminal is moved farther offshore, while others are flat-out opposed to gas extraction. <PARAGRAPH> Shell and government supporters argue that the terminal would provide an economic boost sorely needed in these tough times, creating 800 construction jobs and 130 permanent jobs. <PARAGRAPH> On its website, Shell says the company has met with protesters and fishermen concerned about water contamination, and altered its pipeline route and committed to stringent water treatment as a result. The company's website boasts of quality working conditions, including 2 million work hours and 365 days injury-free in the past year. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile several prominent studies show that Ireland would be getting a much smaller slice of the actual gas profits than almost any other country typically gets from natural resource deals. <PARAGRAPH> Supoport is still strong for the "Rossport Five," locals who in 2007 were jailed for three months on contempt charges for disobeying an injunction regarding protesting against Shell. The activist I spoke with noted that local farmers and teachers feel they are just protecting their historical land, "and you know land is a big deal in Ireland." <PARAGRAPH> In a Q & A for the Goldman Environmental Prize, awarded to Rossport organizer Willie Corduff, the group Kilcommom Community said that Shell's operations have made residents feel "under seige": <PARAGRAPH> Many residents' first experience of the consortium is one of threats, bullying and intimidation. Many felt pressured to sign commitments to allow their land to be used. <PARAGRAPH> Shell and government proponents have billed the gas as an important domestic source that would meet a large portion of Ireland's energy needs, though several regular residents I talked with noted that the gas will be sold on the open market—by a foreign company—offering no real energy security for Ireland. <PARAGRAPH> Given Ireland's tumultuous and painful political history and recent economic turmoil, it's clear that the controversy over the gas terminal taps into deep-seated feelings about sovereignty, land ownership, survival and freedom. I can only imagine the controversy is also exacerbated by increasing interest in fracking for natural gas in western Ireland; and complicated by the struggle to reduce carbon emissions where natural gas plays an important role as a relatively clean-burning fuel. <PARAGRAPH> As the turf-cutting controversy I wrote about previously shows, it seems clear that big-picture environmental promises and even the prospects for some jobs pale beside the importance of protecting land and traditional ways of life in these parts.
Hard Times in Free Derry | <PARAGRAPH>  DERRY, NORTHERN IRELAND -- The graffiti-marred images on the steep Eastway Wall in Derry's Creggan neighborhood tell stories of the area's tumultuous political, social and labor history. There are mentions of Bloody Sunday, the infamous 1972 massacre of participants in a non-violent Catholic civil rights march in Free Derry just down the street.  <PARAGRAPH>  There are also photos and text commemorating and explaining the area's less-famous labor history, which also speaks to the local spirit of resistance and current economic and social woes.  <PARAGRAPH>  Over the June 2-3 weekend, police raided homes in the Catholic Bogside and Creggan neighborhoods in advance of the Olympic torch relay on June 4. Residents called the raids an unjustified affront to their civil rights, and several bombs were thrown at police vehicles, including one just 15 minutes after I left the area on Saturday, that resulted in attempted murder charges.  <PARAGRAPH>  <PICTURE>  <PARAGRAPH>  These skirmishes show the economic and political challenges that residents still face 14 years after the Good Friday agreement. Despite vigorous efforts to heal divisions and create jobs and economic opportunities, Catholic residents are still disproportionately likely to be unemployed, after decades of severe discrimination and institutional inequality.  <PARAGRAPH>  Derry was once home to large factories making dress shirts, electronics and other products, with strong organizing by workers who harbored both "fondness and resentment" for their employers, as one plaque on the Eastway Wall notes. Hundreds of jobs were lost as factories closed, including the United Technologies Automotive (UTA) factory that closed in 1997, shedding 600 jobs. The closure of the Birmingham Sound Reproducers (BSR) factories that once employed more than 2,000 people making record players and tape decks was "devastating despite the sweatshop conditions and the inadequacy of the wages," according to the Eastway Wall art project, part of the Re-Imaging Communities program meant to bring factions together and help people move past historical grievances through public art.  <PARAGRAPH>  While devoting significant space to the factories closed and jobs lost in the area, the Eastway plaques also note the creation of the Rath Mor Indigenous Enterprise Park, a grassroots "self-help" initiative wherein community members gained control of part of the old United Technologies Automotive factory as a home for local businesses. The plaque says:  <PARAGRAPH>  "It is a story born of despair, but filled with hope—testimony to the commitment, courage and perseverance of remarkable people living in remarkable times in a remarkable place. ... The significance of the self-help ethos promoted and fostered by CEL (Creggan Enterprises Limited) is the foundation stone to ensure the revitalization of the area and has become the key structure for job creation."  <PARAGRAPH>  Northern Ireland actually has a lower official unemployment rate than the United Kingdom as a whole, but many are still dependent on government assistance or struggling to survive. There was a 70 percent increase in people on the dole in the past year, and unemployment rates have traditionally been higher among Catholics in Derry.  <PARAGRAPH>  About one in five youth in Northern Ireland are classified as unemployed. Recent news stories note that only one in 10 teachers completing certification can expect to get a job in Northern Ireland, because of budget cuts and dropping student enrollment.  <PARAGRAPH>  Government and private agencies are aggressively pushing tourism as an economic engine, with a special Northern Ireland Summer campaign running that coincides with the opening of a big, permanent Titanic exhibit in Belfast, where the doomed ship was built. A Belfast storefront employment agency is plastered with banners and fliers announcing jobs at the Titanic museum, and bars and stores are filled with Titanic memorabilia.  <PARAGRAPH>  Northern Ireland tourism promoters are even ardently trying to woo "Olympic refugees"—thousands of London residents who are expected to flee their homes because of chaos and security concerns during the Olympics this summer. The Belfast Telegraph reported that one in four Londoners are expected to leave the city during the Games, and Northern Ireland has already seen a big uptick in tourism with 60,000 more visitors this year than last.  <PARAGRAPH>  Tourism would likely be hurt by continued political violence, which is not a thing of the past as evidenced by incidents such as attempted bombings allegedly by Republican Irish dissidents in Newry and Belfast in April, the recent incidents in Derry, and ongoing mistreatment of Republican prisoners by majority British loyalist police forces.  <PARAGRAPH>  Drug addiction and vigilante action against drug dealers have also reportedly become serious problems in Derry and Belfast, with Northern Ireland deputy first minister and long-time Republican leader Martin McGuinness saying that members of a group called Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD), which took credit for the June 3 bomb, are "the new oppressors of the people of Derry."  <PARAGRAPH>  The group reportedly exiles on average four young men from Derry each week, and also has maimed and killed young men accused of drug dealing if they refuse to give up dealing after being warned. The Guardian reported last month:  <PARAGRAPH>  "In some instances those targeted, mostly in their teens or early 20s, have been forced to turn up with a parent or relative to a pre-arranged appointment to be wounded for alleged drug dealing or other supposed crimes."  <PARAGRAPH>  As in many places, the abuse of drugs and the incentive to deal is closely linked to economic conditions and social disenfranchisement. In a gruesome irony, some Irish Republicans' efforts to curb the scourge of abuse in their own communities appears to have perversely morphed into the type of violence and terror visited on them for so long. McGuinness and other critics also said RAAD targets people who have nothing to do with drugs, or who are powerless victims of addiction, not major dealers. He and other Republican leaders have called for RAAD's disbanding.  <PARAGRAPH>  On a short visit, I saw people who seemed very obviously to be struggling with unemployment and drug addiction, and I happened to catch some of the political violence. But I couldn't tell how the Creggan indigenous enterprise project or other "self-help" development efforts are faring. One can only hope such efforts born out of decades of struggle against inequality and marginalization will triumph over continued institutional injustice, violence and cycles of conflict.
Sisyphus and Labor: Chicago Play Celebrates Workers’ Struggles, Past and Present | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> <PARAGRAPH> EVANSTON, IL.—Most people know Sisyphus as the man forever condemned to endlessly push a boulder up a hill, only to have it roll down again. Northwestern University performance studies chair D. Soyini  Madison probably isn’t the first one to use Sisyphus as a metaphor for the seemingly meaningless and soul-sucking nature of hard, repetitive manual labor—which so many people must do to survive, even as their work leaves them relatively little time and energy for really “living.” <PARAGRAPH> But in the play Labor Rites, running May 11 through May 20 at Northwestern, Madison and her crew add a new, unexpected and refreshing twist to the legend of Sisyphus. Rather than being mentally and emotionally crushed and deadened by “dreadful, purposeless repetitious labor,” he is recast as the archetypal “trickster,” in the tradition of Kokopelli, Coyote, Puck and other characters, who has the last laugh because he manages to take control of his own fate and find beauty and glory in his toils. “He turned his punishment and drudgery into possibilities and freedom!” an actor declares. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> In this way, Sisyphus becomes an apt and timeless metaphor for the labor movement, wherein people come together in inspiring acts of resistance, bravery, creativity and pure joy in the face of grueling and brutal oppression and exploitation. <PARAGRAPH> Madison’s play, performed by an impressive cast of undergraduate students, weaves together vignettes of famous and lesser-known labor struggles and labor heroes past and present, with dance, dramatic tableaus and humor from narrator “clowns” and a sort of chorus providing the glue. The mesmerizing physical numbers include a recurring ballet wherein the cast mimics the repetitive motions of sewing in a sweatshop, simultaneously expressing both grace and pain. <PARAGRAPH> The first half of the two-hour production invokes historical sagas: the hell-raising of Mother Jones, the martyrdom of Joe Hill, the deadly Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, the Haymarket Affair, the Memphis sanitation workers strike, the Bread and Roses garment workers movement of a century ago… Being reminded of the boldness, sheer courage and inspiring successes of the labor movement in these decades past, I had the sinking feeling that the movement is in a sorry state today by comparison. <PARAGRAPH> But the second half of the play does much to dispel this feeling, celebrating recent struggles including the Republic Windows and Doors occupation, the battle over public workers union rights in Wisconsin and the UNITE-HERE cafeteria workers campaign. (Disclosure: the Republic Windows segment is adapted from my book Revolt on Goose Island: The Chicago Factory Takeover and What it Says About the Economic Crisis.) <PARAGRAPH> The play invokes the struggles of everyday workers, like those who push wheelchairs at O’Hare and Midway airports or the maid who knows all her employers’ secrets because “half the time they don’t even know you are there.” The waitress “busting your butt for people who don’t know jack about good manners.” The secretary paying more taxes than her boss; the West Virginia coal miner worried about black lung disease. In one of various pointed current references, an actor says emphatically, “Labor is the United States Postal Service!” <PARAGRAPH> Throughout the play Madison stresses the importance of unions, including a vignette where characters square off over common popular criticisms of unions: that they were important in their time but are no longer relevant, that they are bloated and corrupt, that they kill jobs. The ending montage includes calls for a six-hour work day, for “re-imagining labor” and the “right to live, not simply to exist,” peppered with quotes from historical and contemporary leaders like Chicago organizer James Thindwa (a member of In These Times' board of directors) and Elwood Flowers, of the 1968 transit workers strike. <PARAGRAPH> Madison specializes in theater and performance integrated with ongoing social issues; her past works include staging oral histories of service workers and laborers in North Carolina (“I Have My Story to Tell”) and “Water Rites,” a multimedia piece about the privatization of water in Ghana. Her recent book Acts of Activism: Human Rights and Radical Performance explores how women in Ghana use performance in their daily struggles for dignity, economic justice and democracy. <PARAGRAPH> Labor Rites plays Friday May 18 and Saturday May 19 at 8 p.m. and Sunday May 20 at 2 p.m. at the Wallis Theater on Northwestern’s campus in Evanston, Ill., 1949 Campus Drive. Admission is free.
