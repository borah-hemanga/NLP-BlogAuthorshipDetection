The power of Calif.'s ethnic vote|   <paragraph>  Mitt Romney lost California by a landslide this year, but exit polls revealed he made big gains with one important demographic: white voters. In 2008, white Californians voted 52 to 46 percent for President Obama. In 2012, they flipped and voted 53-45 for Romney.  <paragraph>  In the end, though, it made almost no difference. Romney improved over John McCain’s weak 2008 performance by just 1 percentage point.  <paragraph>  Mark DiCamillo, director of California’s Field Poll,  <hyperlink>  explains the tectonic forces that made Romney’s gains largely irrelevant:  <paragraph> " When I first began polling at The Field Poll in the late 1970s, the influence of ethnic voters [Latinos, Asian Americans and African Americans] on California election outcomes was less, and top-of-the-ticket races were typically more competitive affairs, with each party winning their share of the elections. For example, in the 16 elections for president, U.S. Senate and governor between 1978 and 1994, Republican candidates won nine times, while Democrats won seven times.  <paragraph>  The 1994 election marked a turning point, as ethnic voter participation began its ascent…  <paragraph>  A comparison of Field Poll estimates of the composition of the state's registered voters in 1994 to what it is today illustrates the dramatic effect that the growth in ethnic voters has had on the electorate over the past 18 years.  <paragraph>  In 1994 there were 14.7 million registered voters in California. Today there are 18.2 million voters.  <paragraph>  Of the 3.5 million voter increase over this period, about 3 million — or nearly 90 percent of it — came from Latino and Asian American voters."  <paragraph>  This year’s exit polls suggest a dramatic change in the composition of the California electorate in just the past four years: The white share of the vote was 63 percent in 2008, then dropped to 55 percent in 2012.  <paragraph>  Demographic change isn’t the only story here. DiCamillo concludes that the best explanation for the growth in Latino, Asian-American and African-American support for Democratic candidates relates to their view of the role of government.  <paragraph>  While California's white non-Hispanics are evenly divided on whether the government should do more to solve the nation's problems, ethnic voters believe that government should be doing more by nearly 2 to 1.
