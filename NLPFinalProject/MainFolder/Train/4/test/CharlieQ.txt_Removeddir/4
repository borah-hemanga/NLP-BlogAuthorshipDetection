Van Hollen's mixed message |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   It's not uncommon to tailor campaign mailers to specific audiences, but when the messages are this contradictory they tend to stand out — particularly when the Maryland Democratic Party sends them to the same household.  <paragraph>   In this case, the Rep. Chris Van Hollen-as-Paul Ryan's-worst-nightmare piece was sent to the registered Democrat in the house while the more conciliatory 'what divides us' piece was directed to the registered independent.  <paragraph>   It would have been hard to overlook the difference between the red meat mailer and the kinder, gentler piece in any congressional district, but it's especially glaring in Van Hollen's suburban Maryland district, where a high percentage of his constituents work in government or the business of politics.  <paragraph>   In any case, Van Hollen is expected to cruise to an easy victory in his solidly Democratic district.
