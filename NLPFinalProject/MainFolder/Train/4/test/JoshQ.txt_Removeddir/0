U of Denver removes, restores Paula Broadwell video | <paragraph>  <video>  <paragraph>  <video> <paragraph>  The University of Denver removed a speech by alleged David Petraeus paramour Paula Broadwell from YouTube earlier Monday but later re-posted it, a spokeswoman for the school confirmed.  <paragraph>  "We did remove it for a few hours this morning while we were conducting an internal review.  Sorry, again for the inconvenience," spokeswoman Kim DeVigil wrote in response to a query from POLITICO. Despite our inquirites, she did not elaborate on who initiated the review or why.  <paragraph>  Despite the re-posting the video on the university's official YouTube account, a number of blog posts relating to it continue to show that "this video has been removed by the user." That's because the video was re-posted with a different link. <paragraph>  Some recent press reports suggested Broadwell may have shared sensitive or classified information in her Oct. 26 remarks at a D.U. alumni event. However, most or all of what she said about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya was reported earlier that day by Fox News, as we noted   <hyperlink> here.
