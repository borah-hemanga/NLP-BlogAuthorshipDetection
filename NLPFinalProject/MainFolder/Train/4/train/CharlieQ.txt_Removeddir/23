Richard Mourdock, party buzzkill |         <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   In what’s shaping up to a good Republican year in Indiana — Mitt Romney is likely to carry the state, Mike Pence is likely to win the governorship and both legislative chambers figure to remain in GOP control — GOP Senate nominee Richard Mourdock’s candidacy has turned out to be a discordant note.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    The Evansville Courier & Press reports on a marked difference in the reactions to the top of the ticket nominees at the Indiana GOP fall dinner Monday.  <paragraph>   “ However, at the Indiana Republican Party's fall dinner at the Ritz Charles in Carmel on Monday night, enthusiasm for Mourdock's candidacy was measured compared to the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Mike Pence. Some of the hundreds in attendance — mostly women — remained sitting during an ovation for Mourdock and then stood eagerly for Pence. Several Republicans who attended said the reaction was the same at a reception before the dinner.    <paragraph>   Mike McDaniel, the former Indiana Republican Party chairman, said he believes the candidacies of Pence and Mitt Romney will buoy Mourdock — but that the comments on rape and abortion did some damage.    <paragraph>   "Those are comments that he knows he wishes he had back, and yeah, they made it closer," McDaniel said. "I think all the momentum was going in his direction, and that put a screech on that." ”    <paragraph>   Fortunately for Mourdock, top Indiana Republicans haven’t abandoned his candidacy — in part because of what they see as the over-the-top ferocity of the ensuing Democratic attacks against him.    <paragraph>   If he manages to pull out a victory, he’ll still have some serious fence-mending to do if he hopes to be effective in the Senate. Even if Mourdock had never made his comments about pregnancies caused by rape, it would have taken some time for him to win over Republicans who still nurse grievances left from his primary victory over veteran Sen. Dick Lugar. On top of that, he would arrive in Washington far more politically radioactive than the typical freshman senator.
