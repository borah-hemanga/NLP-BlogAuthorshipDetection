2010 losers get their revenge | <picture> <paragraph>  Tuesday was a banner day for Democrats seeking a return to the House after losing their seats in the 2010 GOP wave — and for ex-members of Congress in general.  <paragraph>  Nine former House members, consisting of seven Democrats and two Republicans, are returning for the 113th Congress.  <paragraph>  Six are Democrats who lost in 2010 — Bill Foster, Alan Grayson, Ann Kirkpatrick, Dan Maffei, Carol Shea-Porter and Dina Titus.  <paragraph>  In their case, it wasn’t a clear-cut case of voter remorse. Only Maffei and Shea-Porter knocked off the Republicans who defeated them in 2010.  <paragraph>  Foster, Grayson, Kirkpatrick and Titus all ran against different opponents and in seats altered by redistricting. Now they’ll have the awkward prospect of serving in the same delegation as the members who beat them two years ago.  <paragraph>  Grayson celebrated his victory with typical flair: He sent an email to supporters Wednesday calling his win the "biggest comeback in the history of the US House of Representatives," a nod to his blowout 18-percentage-point loss in 2010, and even more lopsided 25-point victory Tuesday.  <paragraph>  Three other ex-members — Republicans Steve Stockman and Matt Salmon and Democrat Rick Nolan — have been out of Congress for more than a decade.  <paragraph>  Those three, who arrived in Congress as part of famed classes of congressional rookies, will return to an institution that will be close to unrecognizable. Nolan was part of the class of Watergate babies in 1974; he’ll take office as a 69-year-old freshman. Stockman and Salmon were part of the GOP class of 1994.  <paragraph>  Not everyone seeking a second tour of duty made it: Ohio Democrat Charlie Wilson, a 2010 loser, fell short in his rematch against GOP Rep. Bill Johnson.
