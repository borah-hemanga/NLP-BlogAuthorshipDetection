Guantanamo prisoner returns to Canada |  <paragraph>  The United States sent to Canada Saturday morning a Guantanamo prisoner who was born in Canada and captured in Afghanistan at the age of 15, announced the Department of Defense.  <paragraph>  Omar Khadr, now 26, was shot in a battle with U.S. Special Forces in Afghanistan in 2002. He was charged with war crimes, including the murder of a Special Forces medic, though some experts expressed doubt about the legality of charging one combatant in a military encounter with killing another barring some sort of unusual circumstances. Khadr's age also complicated the case and drew criticism of it from international human rights groups.  <paragraph>  In 2010, Khadr pled guilty to the charges as part of a plea deal that called for him to serve eight more years in custody, but allowed for his transfer to Canada after a year and included no guarantee of how long he would actually be confined after returning to Canada.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> The Star report notes that Khadr can apply for parole next summer. However, a senior administration official told POLITICO that Khadr will serve out the sentence imposed by the U.S. military commission at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  "We do not provide details of security assurances, but we did have extensive discussions with the Canadians about the way ahead for Khadr. He will be incarcerated and serve out the remainder of his sentence," said the U.S. official, who asked not to be named in discussing the diplomatic discussions.  <paragraph>  Khadr was picked up at Guantanamo before dawn Saturday and was being flown to Canada, the news reports said.  <paragraph>  Khadr's transfer and the recent death of another detainee leave the public count of prisoners at Guantanamo at 166.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Saturday, 9:05 A.M.): This post has been updated with comment from the U.S. official and to note that Khadr is likely to serve at least some additional jail time in Canada.
