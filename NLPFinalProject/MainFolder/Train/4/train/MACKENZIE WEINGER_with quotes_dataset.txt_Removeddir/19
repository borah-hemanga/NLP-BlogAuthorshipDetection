Nocera questions Mark Thompson hire | The New York Times’s Joe Nocera pointedly asks in his Tuesday column if incoming New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson, who is facing questions over the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, is right for the job. <paragraph>  In his column <hyperlink> , Nocera lays out the timeline of Thompson’s public statements on what he knew and when about the spiked Savile investigation and asks whether The New York Times Co. made the right call with this hire. Thompson is set to start his new gig as the president and CEO of The New York Times Co. on Nov. 12. <paragraph>  (Also on POLITICO: N.Y. Times covers CEO's role in BBC sex abuse scandal <hyperlink> ) “His nameplate is already on his office door. He is getting to know Times employees. Yet, since early October, all anybody has asked about Thompson are those two most damning of questions: What did he know, and when did he know it?” Nocera wrote. <paragraph>  The various statements Thompson has made <hyperlink>— that he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being killed, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011 — are worrisome, Nocera wrote. <paragraph> “Thompson winds up appearing willfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organization the BBC was when Thompson was running it — and what kind of leader he was. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he’d be at The Times,” he wrote. <paragraph> (Also on POLITICO: NYT CEO addresses BBC sex abuse scandal  <hyperlink>) New York Times Co. Chairman “Arthur Sulzberger is in a difficult spot,” he noted. Sulzberger, who declined Nocera’s interview request, “appears to have accepted Thompson’s insistence that he knew nothing about the explosive allegations that became public literally 50 days after he accepted the Times job. Sulzberger is backing his man unreservedly.” <paragraph> “For the sake of Times employees — not to mention the readers who want to see a vibrant New York Times Company — let’s hope his faith in Thompson is warranted. Otherwise, the BBC won’t be the only organization being asked tough questions about its judgment,” Nocera wrote. <paragraph>
