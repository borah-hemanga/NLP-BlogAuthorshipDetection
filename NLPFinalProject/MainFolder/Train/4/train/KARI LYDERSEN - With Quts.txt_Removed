Chicago Passes Austerity Budget with Little Debate (But More Than Usual) | <PARAGRAPH> On Thursday the Chicago City Council passed Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s proposed 2013 budget, which—although it doesn’t include widespread layoffs and service cuts like last year’s—continues the trend of shrinking the city's government. Union analysts and other critics fear a harsh impact on residents who depend on public agencies for services and jobs. <PARAGRAPH> There was never any doubt the budget would pass: Chicago’s city council has long been known as a rubber-stamp body. The vote was 46-3 with one city councilman absent. What was notable was that three councilmen did vote against the budget and one, Robert Fioretti, spoke in strident terms about how cuts and privatization could hurt regular people. Last year’s budget passed unanimously despite deep job cuts, the closure of six union-staffed mental-health clinics, the privatization of primary-care clinics and other public-service cuts.  <PARAGRAPH> “We may not be generating the headlines of the parking meters,” Fioretti said, referring to the debacle in which former Mayor Richard M. Daley leased the city’s meters to a private company, "but we are eliminating middle-class jobs. For what result? What do we say to our constituents who are sold out, to the dedicated employees of mental health centers, to the police officers who are not seeing vacancies filled? ... This helps the city in the long run how?” <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Fioretti was one of a handful of city councilmen in the Progressive Caucus who hosted three evening community budget hearings for citizens to voice concerns, since the mayor broke with tradition in declining to hold any official evening community hearings. <PARAGRAPH> Fioretti concluded by saying he is confident the city can tackle its budget gap but the “lack of transparency and lack of public input gives me great pause." <PARAGRAPH> Pressure to be ‘all in’ <PARAGRAPH> The other councilmen seemed alarmed by Fioretti's dissent, or perhaps by rumors that up five members of the council were considering a "no" vote. Pushing for unanimity, the majority of the council went to great lengths to praise the budget and the mayor. <PARAGRAPH> “If last time was tough and we were all in, I’m at a little bit of a loss to find out why we aren’t all in today,” said Councilman Patrick O’Connor, who used the phrase “all in” several more times.  <PARAGRAPH> “I would like to see today that unanimity ring through this chamber again to demonstrate that the mayor and members of city council are acting together as one," said Ed Burke, arguably the council’s most powerful member. It is widely believed that Burke tried to prevent Emanuel from running for mayor in 2011, but he stressed his loyalty to the mayor's budget. He went on to rave about the heroism of local firefighters, seeming to mean that councilmen who opposed the budget were betraying firefighters—an odd implication given that the firefighters union has fought the Emanuel administration over cuts. <PARAGRAPH> Most of the councilmen who heaped praise upon the budget avoided mentioning the hot-button issues of clinic closures, lost jobs and privatization, which were the main concerns aired at the three community hearings and the one barely-publicized official public budget hearing. Instead, the councilmen focused on smaller issues, with many lauding city plans to ratchet up tree trimming—a service Councilman Leslie Hairston said is necessary because overgrown trees block street lights and create “a breeding ground for people to have their purses stolen." <PARAGRAPH> Numerous councilmen praised the “transparency” of the Emanuel administration and the budget process. This must have been frustrating for the hundreds of citizens who attended the various hearings only to have their concerns almost completely ignored on the day of the vote. Progressive Caucus member Toni Foulkes offered only praise for the budget, though she was at the alternative community hearings and heard hours of testimony about the closing of mental health clinics, among other issues. She did launch into a long rumination on the idea that mental health is a problem, noting that people cannot necessarily recognize the “face of mental illness” in their midst. At no point did she mention mental health clinics. <PARAGRAPH> While Councilman Howard B. Brookins allowed that he had received complaints from 34 water department call-center employees who lost their jobs due to privatization, he praised the mayor’s office for working with them to find other city jobs. (These efforts have not yet borne fruit.) <PARAGRAPH> Shirking responsibility <PARAGRAPH> Union analysts have pointed out that layoffs and cuts which are not immediately obvious may be embedded in the 2013 budget.  The voluminous document includes significantly increased funds for private contracting in the public health and family services departments, indicating privatization is likely in the works. It also includes many references to “efficiency,” a common rationale for job cuts and outsourcing. <PARAGRAPH> AFSCME, which represents Chicago librarians, clinic staff and other public workers, alleges that the city has repeatedly violated the constraints on privatization spelled out in its contract with the union. AFSCME’s contract gives the union the right to “bid” against private contractors when the city is considering privatizing a service. But the union alleges the city has turned services over to private contractors even when AFSCME could do the work more cheaply. For example, the union says the city hired a Japanese firm to take over the water department call center even though the union said city workers could do the job for $800,000 less. <PARAGRAPH> AFSCME says the city has also violated its contract by announcing and moving forward with privatization before notifying the union. For example, Emanuel announced the plan to privatize primary care clinics for a potential savings of $10 million before the union had been consulted.  <PARAGRAPH> Privatization has also made it much harder for unions, consumer groups and others to monitor the quality and equity of city services, the union says. Based on anecdotal reports, advocates doubt that all of the patients who used to depend on public primary-care clinics have been able to get care at the privatized clinics – a concern brought up in the community budget hearings. But it is nearly impossible to find out, since the Freedom of Information Act doesn’t cover private contractors. <PARAGRAPH> A leash on privatization <PARAGRAPH> Nearly all spectators and reporters left the chambers after the budget vote, missing the introduction of a privatization-oversight ordinance that could potentially be very significant for Chicago public employees and taxpayers. <PARAGRAPH> Thirty-two out of the council’s 50 councilmen co-sponsored the Privatization Accountability and Transparency Ordinance, which mandates that before privatizing any service, the city must study its cost-effectiveness. This might seem an obvious idea, but currently the city can and does wait to run such studies until after a contract is awarded. The study must also prove that the economic benefits of privatization outweigh the public benefits of city-run services. <PARAGRAPH> The ordinance mandates that the city work with public employees and union leaders to address quality-of-service issues before turning to a private contractor. This is an important provision to many union leaders, since it is widely believed that city governments allow public services to deteriorate intentionally or through neglect and then use the poor service as a reason to turn it over to the private sector. The ordinance also requires at least one public city council committee hearing be held on service-privatization plans, as it is for asset-privatization plans. <PARAGRAPH> In support of the ordinance, the Chicago Federation of Labor and AFSCME Council 31 issued a statement citing concerns over past privatization deals, including Daley’s parking meter leasing and Emanuel's health clinic privatization. “Any time the city considers taking jobs away from residents and outsourcing them to private companies, it owes those workers a fair chance to keep their jobs,” said CFL president Jorge Ramirez in a statement. <PARAGRAPH> The ordinance was introduced by South Side councilman Roderick T. Sawyer, and needs to pass a committee and then the full council to become city policy. <PARAGRAPH> “I don’t believe there are no good privatization deals,” said a statement by Sawyer, who praised and voted for the 2013 budget. “I just think we should be clear about which deals are in the best interest of the city and which are not. I have a concern about touting monetary savings if we haven’t thought about the people that will lose a job, the families that could lose a home and the local businesses that could lose a loyal customer.”
Activists Arrested Confronting Dick Durbin About ‘Fiscal Cliff’. Chicagoans dressed as Robin Hood staged civil disobedience at the Majority Whip’s office. | <PARAGRAPH> With hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to desperately needed federal safety-net programs looming and the future of Bush-era tax cuts to the rich up in the air, Chicago activists brought their case to U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) last week. <PARAGRAPH> In two days of action on Thursday and Friday, a coalition of Chicago grassroots and faith-based groups called Make Wall Street Pay Illinois demanded that Durbin use his leverage as Senate Majority Whip to protect crucial public services and programs such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare from the massive cuts ahead. <PARAGRAPH> Under the measure known as sequestration, the federal budget will be automatically slashed by $1.2 trillion in January 2013 if Congress doesn’t take action to delay the cuts or find other ways to drastically decrease spending. In the lame-duck session this week, Congress is trying to hash out a “Grand Deal” that would avoid sequestration, but the deal could itself entail significant cuts for safety-net programs. One option to help avoid cuts would be a tax increase; Senators are haggling over whether to restore taxes on the rich to the Clinton-era rate of 39.6 percent, or leave them at the 35 percent rate created by Bush’s tax cuts. <PARAGRAPH> Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke dubbed the potential impacts a looming “fiscal cliff,” and economists say it could mean the loss of more than two million jobs. <PARAGRAPH> On Friday, November 9, eight people entered Durbin’s office in the federal building in Chicago, asked for a meeting with the Senator, and within 15 minutes were arrested. Another six activists from different faith-based and community groups entered the office, but left when faced with a choice between leaving quietly and being arrested. About an hour later, 11 more activists who were holding a banner inside the building’s ground floor lobby were arrested, dragged or carried by officers to a detention center within the building after going limp in protest. <PARAGRAPH> “This says something about who the senator will meet with and when,” said Beth Lanford, chair of the group Northside POWER, who was in Durbin’s office but was not among those arrested. “[His staff was] not even willing to call him on the phone, they didn’t even want to know what we were there for. Meanwhile they’re probably meeting behind closed doors right now, or have been”–about a deal that would include massive cuts. <PARAGRAPH> Serving the rich or protecting the poor? <PARAGRAPH> The protesters challenged Durbin to live up to his reputation as an advocate of the people by blocking cuts to public spending and by raising revenue through higher taxes on the rich and a “Robin Hood Tax” on financial transactions. <PARAGRAPH> In the lobby of the federal building and pressed against the windows outside, several hundred protesters chanted “We are the 99%” and “People over profits.” Members of National Nurses United wore peaked green “Robin Hood “ hats with red arrows, an allusion to HR 6411, proposed by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), a version of the Financial Transaction Tax which has been embraced by a number of debt-ridden European countries including Greece and Spain. Jan Rodolfo, a registered nurse and union employee, noted that nurses in the county health system have already seen increasing numbers of needy patients in severe economic distress, a situation that will only get worse if the government slashes spending on services and entitlement programs. <PARAGRAPH> “We see cancer patients burst into tears because they haven’t eaten in three days,” Rodolfo said. “We see all kinds of stress-related ailments, high blood pressure, ulcers. The suicide rate is sky-high. The county [health system] is where people go when they fall through the cracks, and it’s only going to get worse.” <PARAGRAPH> The previous morning, Nov. 8, protesters visited Durbin’s office and smashed two “golden calves”—actually piñatas—filled with gold coins. “In the Hebrew Bible, Aaron made a golden calf for the Israelites to worship after they grew disenchanted waiting 40 days and nights for Moses to receive God’s commandments,” read a statement from the coalition. “This symbolizes that when we destroy our worship of the idols of excessive wealth and greed, we can find the resources to invest in the common good and build a future of shared prosperity.” <PARAGRAPH> Taking a risk <PARAGRAPH> Before heading to Durbin’s office for the Friday sit-in, members of groups including Northside POWER, Occupy, SOUL (Southsiders Organized for Unity and Liberation) and Illinois Indiana Regional Organizing Network (IIRON) gathered in a small room in a nearby office building to strategize. Those willing to be arrested passed off their valuables to friends for safekeeping. <PARAGRAPH> “[Durbin is] called a champion of the people, but if you’re not willing to take a risk and go against the grain, you’re not a real champion,” Rev. Marilyn Pagán-Banks, executive director of the hunger relief and economic justice group A Just Harvest, tells In These Times. “We’re taking a risk getting arrested today, so he needs to take a risk as well. Lives are at stake here.” <PARAGRAPH> Pagán-Banks was part of a small group of coalition members who met with Durbin in Washington, D.C. in May about the budget debates and were unsatisfied with his answers. They are demanding that he take a strong public stand in support of taxing the rich and protecting average Americans. <PARAGRAPH> University of Chicago student Jacob Swenson, who was arrested during the Friday action, notes, “They’ve been willing to rack up debt for 10 years on two wars, and now they are saying we have to get serious about the debt when it means cuts to programs that serve the poor and ailing.” <PARAGRAPH> He wishes the government would address the budget crisis by stimulating growth through a New Deal-type program that creates jobs, rather than a plan that “puts our communities on the chopping block” as he wrote in a piece for Truthout. After graduating from college in 2007, Swenson, like many people he knew, was unable to find permanent employment and took temp jobs for $10 an hour with no benefits. He's now a graduate student and instructor at the University of Chicago.  <PARAGRAPH> “Unfortunately the Obama administration and our own Senator Durbin are relatively immune to learning from experience,” he tells In These Times. “They talked about compromise for four years, and look what it got us. And it’s not a genuine compromise when 50 percent of the elected officials are arguing for the benefit of a fraction of Americans.” <PARAGRAPH> Sequestration and the fiscal cliff <PARAGRAPH> The Make Wall Street Pay coalition demands that Durbin support the “Robin Hood” financial transaction tax; allow no cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid; and oppose extending the Bush-era tax cuts currently set to expire at the end of the year. <PARAGRAPH> Durbin has voiced support for the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan as a solution to the “fiscal cliff.” However, economic justice groups say the plan disproportionately hurts low-income and working people, and doesn’t place enough burden on the rich. The plan, drafted by former President Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson, the co-chairs of Obama's Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, would include about $2.9 trillion in cuts, about half of which have already been made, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. <PARAGRAPH> In a 2010 op-ed, Durbin defended his position (in third-person): <PARAGRAPH> Why is a progressive like Dick Durbin voting for this deficit commission report? First, all politicians, left or right, Democrat or Republican, have to acknowledge the deficit crisis our nation faces. Borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar we spend for missiles or food stamps is unsustainable. And being indebted for generations to China and OPEC does not make American a stronger nation. <PARAGRAPH> As The Christian Science Monitor explained, there is no doubt that impending cuts will be extremely severe, but it is still unclear exactly what impacts they would have on different services and jobs. The likely cumulative effect has been compared to an austerity program similar to the measures that created massive public uprising and social distress in Europe in the past few years.  <PARAGRAPH> Outrage across Chicago <PARAGRAPH> As the Make Wall Street Pay Coalition targeted Durbin, the Chicago Federation of Labor held a press conference on November 8 urging outgoing Congress members, such as right-wing Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.), “not to slash vital programs” during the lame duck session. Since November 8, Chicago unions have funded a television ad that asks “elected officials to stand up for the middle class following the election,” according to a statement from the federation. <PARAGRAPH> Tom Balanoff, president of SEIU Local 1, which represents janitors, security guards and other Chicago workers, tells In These Times that the federal budget negotiations and other political and economic trends mean Americans are poised to lose the social safety net and the “American dream” that generations of unions and social movements have fought to preserve. <PARAGRAPH> “If we really want to raise standards in this country, we have to raise revenue through fair taxes and we need to raise people’s wages,” he says. “They want to eliminate Social Security and Medicare–these aren’t ‘entitlements,’ these are things we have worked for and paid for that they keep chipping away at. There’s already a huge gap between the haves and the have-nots. If they eliminate the safety net, what is the difference between us and a ‘third world’ country?”
At ‘Official’ Budget Hearing, Chicagoans Find Official Indifference and Empty Chairs | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO—During three community budget hearings this month, Chicago union members and other regular residents voiced their fears about the priorities of the city’s proposed 2013 budget, which many worry could spell privatization, layoffs and service cuts. Those hearings were unofficial events, however, hosted by a handful of city councilmen in the Progressive Caucus, since Mayor Rahm Emanuel declined to hold the customary evening hearings for the public to discuss the budget. <PARAGRAPH> Someone who attended Chicago’s only official public budget hearing at noon on October 31 might have thought they were in an entirely different city. Nearly every speaker praised the budget and thanked the mayor for creating jobs and making the city more business-friendly. A plumbers union business agent described Emanuel as “such a strong supporter of organized labor” (an unusual perspective). <PARAGRAPH> There were only a few critics, as most of the concerned residents who had flocked to the alternative hearings either didn’t know about the poorly publicized “official” hearing or could not leave work midday to attend. <PARAGRAPH> Perhaps it didn’t matter, since more than half the city’s aldermen didn’t bother to attend. Also absent was Mayor Emanuel himself. <PARAGRAPH> City Clerk Susana Mendoza kicked off the hearing by reading the official notice that had been published in The Chicago Sun-Times 12 days earlier: “The budget document is in pamphlet form and has been conveniently made available for inspection at the city clerk’s office and in the Harold Washington Library,” she recited, then left the room. <PARAGRAPH> Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce vice president of policy Mike Mini thanked the mayor for eliminating the “head tax” that makes it more expensive to hire employees and for promising not to raise taxes. He said, “It’s more important than ever we enact policies to position ourselves as the most business-friendly city in America.” Chicago Hilton general manager John Wells praised Emanuel on the same grounds and noted that the hotel business is picking up and should be offering more jobs. <PARAGRAPH> James F. Coyne, business manager of the of the plumbers union Local 130 UA, said the plumbers “wholeheartedly support Mayor Emanuel’s budget,” noting that jobs will be created by the city’s plans for badly-needed sewer and water system overhauls. Coyne also invited veteran alderman Ed Burke, whose grandfather co-founded the union, to sing a ditty about plumbers “protecting the health of the nation.” Burke recited the words: “So when your water is clear and bright, then you know your pipes are tight, and you know a union plumber put them there.” <PARAGRAPH> AFSCME Council 31 policy and legislative specialist Adrienne Alexander was the first critical voice, presenting the union’s recent report on the impacts of closing six city mental health clinics. She noted that about 500 patients had “disappeared” from city records, disproportionately black and Latino staff had been laid off, and the remaining staff had inherited much greater workloads. <PARAGRAPH> “Aldermen, at a point you’re not doing more with less, you’re just doing less,” Alexander said. “We ask you, don’t support this budget that continues the privatization and diminishment of public services.” <PARAGRAPH> Then came Jorge Castellanos, wearing a purple SEIU T-shirt saying “Chicago needs a responsible bidders ordinance.” In careful heavily-accented English, Castellanos read from a statement: <PARAGRAPH> “This summer I lost my job as a janitor at the water department when the city replaced my employer with an irresponsible contractor. When a new company took over they fired me and my five co-workers even though we had years of experience. The mayor’s office changed to a non-union contractor…That doesn’t make sense, we have good jobs with decent wages and have insurance. Now we are struggling. It has been four months and I still have not found a job. I’m worried about paying my bills and tuition for my son in college. The workers that replaced us are paid low wages and don’t have insurance. I don’t think that helps working families, to eliminate good middle-class jobs…It makes me sad that our mayor did this to hard-working Chicagoans. Some of us have been working at city buildings for five, 10 and even more than 15 years. This is why I’m coming here, you know…I tell Mayor Emanuel please don’t cut good jobs for the people. Thank you so much and God bless you.” <PARAGRAPH> Castellanos’s remarks were met with complete silence. In contrast, previous speakers touting domestic-violence programs and community-development agencies had received gushing support and game questions from the aldermen. <PARAGRAPH> Lonnell Saffold, institutional division director for SEIU Local 1, spoke next, pointing out that by hiring a cheaper contractor who laid off Castellanos and his coworkers, the city of Chicago would just be transferring costs to taxpayers in other ways. Deprived of their wages and health insurance, the laid-off workers will likely be relying on the county system for health care and collecting federal unemployment benefits.   <PARAGRAPH> “You don’t take people making $14 an hour and take their jobs, their health care to balance the budget,” Saffold said, calling for the city to pass the responsible bidders ordinance which would help protect union jobs under private contractors. “They did nothing wrong–they paid their taxes, they want to send their kids to school and have a good opportunity for the American dream. But their dreams have been shattered because someone decided it was a good idea to give their jobs to non-union contractors.” <PARAGRAPH> The number of aldermen in the room had dwindled even more by the time George Blakemore walked up to make his comment. For years Blakemore has been a constant fixture at public meetings of every sort, offering his opinions and proposals—often calls for more resources for the African American community. Blakemore respectfully thanked the council for holding a public budget meeting but noted that “most of your comrades do not feel the need to be present at this public process.” <PARAGRAPH> Dressed sharply in a brown suit and patterned tie, he noted that he used to wear ratty old clothes to the annual budget hearings, but he’d decided to start dressing up to lend a little more dignity to the process. “But it’s still the same thing, still this dog and pony show around the budget and still the same thing – the black community receives peanuts.” <PARAGRAPH> The next speaker, who had “endured indignities” making his way downtown from a poor African American neighborhood on the West Side, gestured ruefully at the “empty chairs” and the chatting aldermen who “don’t even want to hear what I have to say because they’re holding another meeting over there.” Then West Side resident Paul McKinley denounced “a Caligula-style mayor who refused to face the public, who refused to face society,” before getting into a shouting match with an alderwoman over his allegations that she allowed a convenience store to openly sell bullets. <PARAGRAPH> The aldermen were still muttering over McKinley’s outburst as the final speaker, Jeanette Hansen, made her points. A former patient at one of the shuttered mental health clinics, Hansen extolled the skills and compassion of her therapist, Eric Lindquist, and reminded the few aldermen who were paying attention that fellow patient Helen Morley had died after their clinic was closed. “There’s a stigma attached to mental illness, we know this,” she said. “But it’s an illness like any other, it’s a chemical imbalance in the brain and it’s not our fault.” <PARAGRAPH> Hansen noted that access to stable therapy and medication are key to giving mentally ill people a better chance to work and support themselves. She said she had worked for the city for 15 years writing parking tickets. She now relies on food stamps but hopes to become self-sufficient by making artistic trinkets and selling them with a peddlers’ license. <PARAGRAPH> Her conclusion about the budget: “All I can say is pennywise and pound-foolish. Thank you.” <PARAGRAPH> As soon as she finished speaking the moderator called on Ed Burke, the city’s most powerful alderman, to officially adjourn. But they had to wait, as he was on his cell phone.
Chicago Chicanos ‘Read Out’ in Solidarity with Tucson | <PARAGRAPH> Books can save your life. <PARAGRAPH> Especially if you are growing up in a rough area, faced with discrimination, racism, poverty, violence and a dominant culture that seems to belittle your family’s history and your very existence. <PARAGRAPH> That’s how celebrated author and community leader Luis J. Rodriguez described his youthful relationship with books. Growing up in a tough L.A. neighborhood where a gang attack left him with a damaged chin at age 11, Rodriguez was a young heroin addict and gang member. He eventually left that life and became an internationally-known writer, artist and youth advocate. The shift started with a book of Mexican murals given to him by a counselor who was also a Chicano activist with the radical Brown Berets. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Now, Rodriguez’s books are among those banned from public school curriculums in Tuscon, Ariz. as part of an attack on Mexican American studies by the city’s school board and a state law. On Sunday, at the Taller Mestizarte gallery in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, Rodriguez read from one of his own books and spoke about the larger importance of books dealing with politics, Chicano culture and popular movements. <PARAGRAPH> There was much attention last year to the removal of a long list of book titles from Tucson schools after the school board became afraid that ethnic studies violated a 2010 state law prohibiting courses “designed primarily for pupils of one ethnic group” that “advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals” or promote “resentment toward a race or class of people.” In These Times covered the efforts of Tucson student activists to organize their own ethnic studies classes, as well as a month-long “No History is Illegal” campaign to incorporate the banned Mexican American studies curriculum into classrooms across the country last February. <PARAGRAPH> But Chicano, Latino and other activists and educators in Chicago feel that the issue has now dropped off the public radar. They fear that attacks on free speech, education and ethnic studies will spread around the country if people don’t continue to fight the Tucson school board. <PARAGRAPH> That’s why Rodriguez – who previously lived in Chicago and founded Tia Chucha Press here – joined local artists, activists, students and teachers in the small Pilsen gallery to read from books on Tucson’s banned list. Appropriately, the event was held on 18th Street in Pilsen, a hotbed of Chicano organizing in decades past. <PARAGRAPH> Rodriguez remembered how, along with receiving the book from the Brown Beret, “an Anglo teacher opened up the world of books for me.” He also recalled how librarians would watch him with an eagle eye, suspecting he intended to steal books. At an independent bookstore owned by a Jewish-American man in his own rough neighborhood, Rodriguez said the owner would “watch me not because he thought I would steal but because he wanted to see what my interests were.” <PARAGRAPH> While homeless and living beside the Los Angeles River, Rodriguez would stow books in little “cubby holes” and other secret spots. “Books, man!” he reiterated. “They save your life … This is why the battle in Tucson is important.” <PARAGRAPH> On the gallery walls between bright abstract paintings were cardboard signs reading, “Save Ethnic Studies” and “History is not Illegal.” <PARAGRAPH> Antonio Zavala, one of the Pilsen event organizers, invoked Ray Bradbury’s famous Fahrenheit 451 as a cautionary tale. He paraphrased the Tuscon school board members’ contentions that the Chicano and other ethnic studies programs teach hatred toward Anglos and foster an “us versus them” environment. <PARAGRAPH> “They want to promote this idea that ‘Just work hard and you’ll make it,’” he said. “But that’s a big fallacy – just look at the African American community, they’ve worked hard through so many conditions and they’re still looked on as second class citizens … This is a designated attack on the rights of Mexican Americans and their culture and right to education.” <PARAGRAPH> Two participants read from Laura Esquivel’s book Like Water for Chocolate, pointing out the important cultural symbolism and mocking the fact that the school board saw such tales of food and desire as threatening. <PARAGRAPH> “What do they have against chefs … what do they have against love?” asked participant, after reading stanzas from the book. After reading a fragment about “punish[ing] Tita for her willfulness,” she said, “Ah! Maybe that’s it, willfulness.” <PARAGRAPH> Another participant read from 500 Years of Chicano History, pointing out that she could see why it might be seen as threatening in a state rife with anti-immigrant and racist dynamics…and that is all the more reason to make sure students have the chance to read and discuss the material. She pointed out how “Anglos put the label of bandit on our resistance heroes.” Several others read from Paoulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed and from Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States. <PARAGRAPH> The next step for Tucson organizers will be a three-day “Tucson Freedom Coalition” convergence in November, where they hope to unite a national movement around the battle for ethnic studies in Arizona. <PARAGRAPH> Dr. Teresa Cordova, director of the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said at Sunday’s event, “I had the opportunity to go to the university because of the Chicano movement…So I always felt like my education was not my own but belonged to the community.” <PARAGRAPH> “One of the reasons they’re afraid of the Pedagogy of the Oppressed is the idea of using education as a way for people to understand the context under which they live and the possibility for transforming it,” Cordova continued. “That we are not just victims but agents of transformation.”
At Alt Budget Hearing, Chicagoans Decry Privatization and Job Cuts | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO–Labor leaders and workers fear that the proposed 2013 budget, which the City Council will vote on November 15, could mean many job cuts as the city moves to increase efficiency, cut services and possibly introduce more privatization in various departments. <PARAGRAPH> Chicago union leaders say it is unclear exactly what the economic and job impacts of the proposed budget will be for public-sector workers and other residents, and there are not as many obvious job cuts as last year’s budget. In his budget address to the City Council on October 10, Mayor Rahm Emanuel promised no new taxes or fees in spite of the $298 million budget shortfall, and said 500 new police officers would be hired and 275 “unnecessary” administrative positions eliminated. But even union and community leaders who have parsed the recently released voluminous document say it is unclear what exactly it means for the city. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, residents feel they have been denied the chance to get more information and voice their opinions, especially since Mayor Rahm Emanuel has decided not to hold a series of evening neighborhood public meetings as has been the norm since former Mayor Harold Washington started them three decades ago. In response, city councilmembers of the Progressive Caucus are holding three evening community meetings of their own, including one at a high school the evening of Oct. 24 <PARAGRAPH> There, numerous residents—many of them public-sector union members—voiced their concerns about privatization, job loss, discrimination and the overall priorities of the city administration. <PARAGRAPH> “I was laid off from the Office of Emergency Management, I worked here for 16 years and now a contractor is doing my job,” said one woman, who proceeded to speak for much more than her allocated three minutes, reciting her resume and attributes in a desperate plea for work. “I am dedicated, dependable…I am job ready. I was born and raised in this city, I love this city and I love the people,” she said. <PARAGRAPH> Ben Joravsky of the Chicago Reader and other critics have noted that former Mayor Richard M. Daley was known to look bored, distracted and even leave the room as residents addressed him during budget hearings, but at least he attended the meetings that ran late into the evenings in diverse neighborhoods across the city. They have blasted Emanuel for not making even a half-hearted effort to hear public opinion first hand before the budget is finalized. <PARAGRAPH> “For an administration that’s pledged to openness and transparency, they shut the public out,” said Alderman Bob Fioretti, one of the hosts of the community hearing. “I’m concerned about the direction of our city and what this budget does.” <PARAGRAPH> “No es justo (it’s an injustice)," said Alderman Ricardo Muñoz, among the eight council members who promised to listen to community concerns and share them with the full council. <PARAGRAPH> Alderman Toni Foulkes said she’s concerned about constituents like an unemployed man who called her office, worried what would happen to his family if his wife lost her job at the water department through privatization or cuts. <PARAGRAPH> Loud clapping and cheering from the crowd of several hundred greeted each statement about privatization and Emanuel’s attacks on public unions. <PARAGRAPH> “Privatization is for political purposes only,” said Robert Stone. “If contractors want to get city work, they give donations to politicians who are all too willing to lay off public employees. But private contractors do not do as good a job as city workers.” <PARAGRAPH> Several speakers noted that employees of private contractors don’t need to live within Chicago like city workers do, so replacing city workers with contractors can mean the tax base in Chicago is essentially diluted. <PARAGRAPH> “Non-residents are taking our jobs,” said Caroline Broeren, a librarian who has seen first-hand the impact of cuts to the library system in last year’s budget—though much of those cuts were restored thanks to a campaign by the AFSCME union. “We want to be able to continue providing services to the people who live in our communities, but we’re having that taken away from us by privatization. And the low initial bids of contractors end up costing a lot more later – not just financially – as an employee of the city I care about what happens in the city. I don’t know that private contractors will.” <PARAGRAPH> Lula White, a member of AFSCME Local 505 and an employee of the city’s health department, said that last year’s cuts to public mental health and general care clinics have been devastating. She said that since six mental health clinics were closed and other clinics were privatized, needy patients have fallen through the cracks. <PARAGRAPH> “We or I should say the mayor and his budget have cut the health services,” White said. “My question for you all (aldermen) who voted for the budget last year” is have the patients displaced from the shuttered mental health clinics found their way to other clinics? “The patients are not there … where are they?” <PARAGRAPH> Sijisfredo Aviles, a volunteer with the affordable housing organization Bickerdike, noted “the loss of jobs keep many of my family and friends in poverty and many are homeless. I personally have to juggle my monthly social security check with paying my rent, healthcare and personal needs.” He said that even the affordable housing Bickerdike offers “is out of reach for dozens of people in my community because of the poverty wages they receive.” He called on the mayor to “make sure funds are used responsibly in our community and not downtown for corporate welfare,” highlighting the use of TIF (tax increment financing) taxpayer funds to subsidize the River Point Plaza outside a luxurious downtown office building. <PARAGRAPH> In his budget address, Emanuel said $25 million in surplus funds from the controversial TIF program would go back into general city coffers. The Grassroots Collaborative and other groups are calling on him to make sure those funds benefit people in the neighborhoods that need it most. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel also said the $298 million projected deficit is the smallest since the 2008 recession started. He said more than 4,000 jobs are being created by bringing new corporate headquarters and other employers to Chicago, and he thanked “Labor,” specifically the Laborers' Local 1001 union and SEIU Local 73, for working with the city to make reforms that will save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. In many cases these reforms are what concern workers and union leaders—for example the institution of competitive bidding (i.e., potential privatization) for airport janitorial work, tree-trimming and planting, recycling and other services—even city legal work, “starting with legal services for workers’ compensation.” <PARAGRAPH> At the community hearing, skeptical residents not only railed against privatization but offered some of their own suggestions. <PARAGRAPH> Joe Zefran called for city support of worker-owned cooperatives. Clearly referring to Walmart and Target, he said: “We really want to talk about what kind of jobs we want to attract and what kind of businesses we want to attract. Some of these companies coming in from northwest Arkansas and Minnesota are beneath our dignity – they’re not the kinds of jobs we want to see.” <PARAGRAPH> Long-time county government employee and activist Chris Geovanis called on the city council to pass measures to protect workers from privatization and job cuts. <PARAGRAPH> “We’ve asked the city of Chicago to do things like passing a (new, more comprehensive) living wage ordnance; we need to revisit that,” she said. “We need to see (city or state) legislation proposed that mirrors the (federal proposed) Employee Free Choice Act. … That would provide minimum safeguards for public-sector workers, and also these public workers being privatized out and brought back at slave wages. ... Those are the kind of ordinances we need to see from our aldermen, and we need to see a no vote on this budget.”
Chicagoans Give Rahm Emanuel Poor Grades | <PARAGRAPH> At an October 22 forum sponsored by Columbia College, three prominent Chicago political analysts gave Mayor Rahm Emanuel grades ranging from "C" to "D-" to "incomplete." Emanuel lost points because of his battle with the Chicago Teachers Union and his looming confrontations in negotiations with the transit workers, firefighters and police unions. <PARAGRAPH> The speakers—professors from DePaul University and from Columbia College, and Chicago Reader firebrand columnist Ben Joravsky—each speculated that Emanuel’s labor problems stemmed from the mayor's infamously combative personality. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Larry Bennett, a political science professor at DePaul who gave Emanuel an "incomplete" since the mayor is mid-term, offered three hypotheses as to why the mayor took “such an aggressive approach” with the teachers: <PARAGRAPH> Did Mayor Emanuel really think the Chicago Teachers Union was the devil and in order to improve public education in Chicago you have to break the teachers union? <PARAGRAPH> [Or] was Mayor Emanuel’s approach in some sense political—[as though] taking a hard line with the teachers union was going to endear him with certain constituencies which would be of use to him? <PARAGRAPH> Or was it possibly produced by a character flaw—a reflexive tendency to bully people who you ought to engage in a cooperative effort? <PARAGRAPH> Joravsky, too, raised the possibility that Emanuel’s stubbornness and impulsivity played a role in the showdown with the Chicago Teachers Union. He noted that tensions first rose when Emanuel insisted on demanding a longer school day—despite the fact that there was not money to pay teachers for their extra work and neither teachers nor parents cited school day length as a major problem. <PARAGRAPH> “A prudent wise view of public schools would somehow distinguish between all the contrasting needs and try to apportion what little money we have,” Joravsky said. “That would require working with your public, unions, principals, etc. Instead Mayor Rahm continued to campaign—he had campaigned on extending the day, he was going to extend the day no matter who got in his way—and we had debacle led to the teachers strike.” <PARAGRAPH> Joravsky gave Emanuel an “incomplete” for his performance as mayor but a "D-" in terms of his larger political career, blaming Emanuel not only for an anti-union ideology but also for grossly underestimating the power and popularity of the teachers union. He thinks this crucial mistake—on its face surprising from such an ambitious and intelligent politician—came because Emanuel “wasn’t born in Chicago, he hardly ever lived in Chicago, as far as I could tell he never thought much about Chicago, he’s learning what Chicago is as he goes along.” <PARAGRAPH> “He came to the conclusion that the Chicago teachers union was not important to him—that like unions in general they were losing power, losing membership, very unpopular among the rank and file, and he could probably advance his career by getting in a fight with them.” <PARAGRAPH> Dominic Pacyga, a history professor at Columbia College, gave Emanuel a "C" largely because of his embattled relationship with labor, including the police and firefighters unions. He said that given the city’s soaring murder rate, which has gained international attention in the past year, the city should be hiring 2,000 additional officers rather than trimming police budgets. <PARAGRAPH> Pacyga also thinks Emanuel’s administration should do more to bring in blue-collar jobs and build on Chicago’s existing manufacturing base, especially by utilizing land on the city’s vast Southeast side. <PARAGRAPH> “There are a lot of people here who need work, people who don’t want to go to college, who don’t want to be part of the digital revolution; they want good paying jobs so they can pay a mortgage,” he said. “Chicago is still one of the best manufacturing centers of the United States, we do produce a lot of things here and we can continue that if City Hall has a logical realistic plan.” <PARAGRAPH> When an attendee who had worked on Emanuel’s campaign requested that the panelists discuss the mayor’s successes, there was an awkward silence. Joravsky offered the only concrete response, praising Emanuel's recent decriminalization of marijuana. Bennett described Emanuel as “a lifestyle liberal [who] appeals to bike riders such as myself ... he’s developing a cultural plan, he will be attentive to gays and lesbians…there’s a way he carves out a liberal niche for himself even as he pushes forward a city government that is fundamentally business-oriented." <PARAGRAPH> The panelists discussed the Mayor’s penchant for privatization, and noted that in certain contexts it might be a smart move that can improve services and create jobs, such as in the privatization of garbage pickup. But Bennett warned against applying privatization as a catch-all to more complicated sectors like education: <PARAGRAPH> To me the issue with the business approach to city government is that while there’s no such thing as a public versus private sector way to collect garbage, things like running public schools are more complicated. In the United States the greatest social problem we confront is increasing economic and social inequality. One way I expect that to be further exacerbated is the collapse of the public education system where all kinds of consumers with all kinds of resources and ability to choose schools are set loose to choose schools and those people with what we social scientists so nicely call social capital and also real capital will get good educations and the others won’t…Too simply say we have to fix schools by privatizing them doesn’t even begin to address those problems.
Lessons From Essen: What the U.S. Rust Belt Can Learn From Germany | <PARAGRAPH> ESSEN, GERMANY—Stephan Haas has probably given this spiel hundreds of times, but he still sparkles with enthusiasm and mischievous wit as he tells the tale of the notorious Krupp family, the German magnates who helped make this area the heart of German industry. Speaking English for the benefit of French and Finnish visitors, Haas describes how Friedrich Krupp caused a scandal by reportedly seducing boys in Italy and how his wife Margaret was committed to a “madhouse” when her complaints about her husband became inconvenient. He shows visitors around the imposing Krupp mansion, slyly critiquing the architecture, and explains the company town known as Margarethenhöhe, which houses Krupp managerial workers. <PARAGRAPH> Krupp’s company, now the multinational ThyssenKrupp, is still based in Essen in the Ruhr region in northwestern Germany, where the smokestacks of steel mills, coal-fired power plants and factories still rise above the otherwise lush green fields and hills. But over the past decades, much of the steel and coal industries once located here have closed up, along with the underground coal mines that in the 1950s employed 470,000 and now employ only about 30,000. Of more than 200 underground mines that once supplied 125 million tons of coal a year, only a handful remain open and they are all scheduled for closure by 2018. Because of the offshoring of industry and the import of cheaper coal from Colombia, Poland and South Africa, the Ruhr region now has among the country’s highest levels of unemployment and economic distress. (Though it is still noticeably more prosperous than much of western Europe and the United States; Germany has weathered the economic crisis better than most.) <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> “It used to be that miners were the underground kings, everyone respected them, this whole region was built by coal,” says Haas. “But now if you say you are a miner, you wouldn’t get the same response you used to. The memory is fading, and the miners are disappearing like dinosaurs.” <PARAGRAPH> (A significant mining industry still remains southwest of the Ruhr region around the town of Duren, near Cologne, but that is the strip-mining of soft, dirty “brown coal” burned in nearby power plants run by the company RWE. Activists and local legislators who oppose the industry note that it employs relatively few people, because the massive strip mines are largely automated, and causes huge amounts of pollution that endanger public health and contribute to climate change.) <PARAGRAPH> Like some former industrial and mining areas in the United States, civic leaders in the Ruhr region have tried to rebrand the area as a mecca for arts, culture and tourism, celebrating the rich industrial history (and now-lower levels of pollution). Their plan got a major boost in 2010 when the European Commission named the area a “European Capital of Culture,” a designation created in 1985 as a means to promote European cohesiveness and boost an area’s tourism and economic vitality. Since then, millions of visitors from the rest of Germany, Europe and beyond have toured new modern art museums and historical sites in towns and cities like Essen, Mulheim, Dortmund and Duisburg. The idea was that the region’s new identity could create tourism-related and other service-economy jobs and attract new high tech and other businesses to locate while maintaining a role for the heavy industry that does still exist. The region has also gained tens of thousands of jobs related to renewable energy, according to regional Green Party elected officials, since solar power installation and manufacturing (and to a lesser degree wind power) has boomed in Germany in the past few years. It helps that the Ruhr region, in part because of its industrial heritage, is home to 20 universities, including top technical institutes. <PARAGRAPH> A massive former mine and coking plant called Zollverein is a prime example of the region’s transformation. Zollverein once consisted of almost 100 miles of underground tunnels and railroads that descended almost a mile deep, where tens of thousands of miners working in often horrifying conditions extracted many millions of tons of coal from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s. Much of the mine infrastructure and the central coking plant sprawling across the surface of the mine have been preserved. They now appear sculptural and surreal: soaring towers capped with wheels that pulled coal out of the earth; maze-like networks of conveyor belts and rail tracks; shining boilers, cylinders and cooling towers that are beautiful in abstract and geometric ways; even a carnivalesque contraption reminiscent of a Ferris wheel rising above the coking ovens, which were closed in 1993. <PARAGRAPH> The Ruhr Museum, depicting the region’s history from prehistoric times to the present, is housed in the old coal wash house, and events from alternative energy conferences to weddings are held in countless converted conference rooms and reception halls onsite. Another former mining structure houses the highly regarded Red Dot Design Museum, while old coal buildings are also home to smaller art galleries and studios and a revolving schedule of concerts and performances. <PARAGRAPH> Also tapping the Ruhr’s regional heritage is the Bergbau Mining Museum in nearby Bochum, which was founded in 1930 and got a major boost thanks to the Capital of Culture.  More than a million people annually peruse a vast and eclectic mix of mining paraphernalia, artifacts and art. The collection, hard to see in a single day, includes hundreds of different miners’ lanterns from over the decades, a plethora of quirky dioramas and several rooms packed with mineral samples from around the world. <PARAGRAPH> The high quality, efficiently run museums and tourism services in the Ruhr region provide an inspiration for U.S. Rust Belt towns trying to stimulate tourism and culture to replace the mining and manufacturing jobs that have disappeared. But the Ruhr region also shows that even a thriving tourism and culture industry provides a relatively small amount of direct employment, with the jobs directly created across a whole region unlikely to ever match the jobs lost at even one mass employer like acoal mine or steel mill. Jobs may be created in restaurants, shops and the like, but most tourists still move through the region in a matter of several days, so the economic ripple effects of popular museums and cultural institutions do not appear to be wide. Various people working in the area said that the European Capital of Culture designation brought a wave of attention and economic stimulus, but didn’t create significant lasting changes in the area’s identity or economics. <PARAGRAPH> And this is all in a place like western Germany where tourists from other relatively well-off countries can regularly and easily travel. Luring visitors to a remote former mining village in Colorado or a notorious post-industrial city like Gary, Indiana, is an entirely different story. <PARAGRAPH> A more realistic replacement for the lost jobs might revolve around clean energy. The German Green Party claims that in little more than a decade renewable energy has created 380,000 jobs, thanks to government policies like the feed-in tariff that promotes it. A significant portion of these jobs are located in the Ruhr region. For former U.S. industrial areas that still have infrastructure and skilled workers, such green jobs could be a better bet than tourism and culture in terms of employment, although, as in the Ruhr region, the two approaches can complement each other. <PARAGRAPH> But the well-being of a region or a city has to do with more than its employment statistics and economic indicators. Pride in place and history and the cultural, artistic and social resources that are available to local residents and draw visitors surely have benefits beyond the economic bottom-line. The Southeast Environmental Task Force in Chicago had tried to turn a former coking plant on the city’s far south side into a museum before the structure was ultimately demolished. The group had failed to get the adequate funds or political and institutional support for their project. Wandering the grounds of Zollverein, I couldn’t help but think of the shame that a similar (if smaller scale) opportunity in an economically struggling community in Chicago was squandered. But countless opportunities still exist; hopefully U.S. leaders and regular residents can take inspiration from places like Zollverein to create monuments that provide some economic stimulation and pay tribute to U.S. workers and industries of years past. <PARAGRAPH> Kari Lydersen is spending two weeks in Germany and the United Kingdom thanks to a Climate Media Fellowship from the Heinrich Böll Foundation North America. She'll be reporting on renewable energy, past and current coal mining regions, and the role of coal and renewables in these countries’ energy futures.
Lawsuit Sheds Light on Murky and Dangerous Warehouse Sector | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Working In These Times has frequently covered the warehousing industry and the way that complicated layers of different companies using, owning, operating and staffing warehouses make the sector ripe for labor abuse. <PARAGRAPH> A motion for sanctions filed August 23 in a workers’ class action lawsuit against southern California Wal-Mart warehouses sheds more light on this structure and alleges that defendant Schneider Logistics failed to provide legally mandated evidence to avoid culpability for workers’ wages and working conditions. <PARAGRAPH> Last October, workers affiliated with the group Warehouse Workers United filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. district court in California alleging labor law violations at Mira Loma warehouses operated solely for Wal-Mart stores. The lawsuit names Schneider Logistics Inc. (SLI) and its subsidiary Schneider Logistics Transloading and Distribution (STLD) along with the companies Impact and Premier, which hired people to staff the warehouses. Schneider took over operation of the warehouses in 2006. <PARAGRAPH> The initial complaint said: <PARAGRAPH> Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated to recover the wages that defendants stole — and are continuing to steal — from them in violation of federal and California law. Plaintiffs also seek redress for other consequences of defendants’ unlawful conspiracy, including defendants’ wrongful scheme to hide and then cover up the extent of their wrongdoing by failing to keep mandatory payroll records, falsifying records of hours worked and compensation owed, and concealing, denying and/or misrepresenting to the workers the amount of their earnings and on what basis these earnings were calculated. <PARAGRAPH> A key question is whether Schneider or STLD directly employed--and is therefore responsible for the working conditions of--the plaintiffs, including lead plaintiff Everardo Carrillo. The plaintiffs allege that Schneider is their “joint employer” along with the other defendants. <PARAGRAPH> Schneider Logistics initially argued that it had “no connection with or responsibility for the operation, oversight, or supervision” of the workers at the Mira Loma warehouses, as quoted in the recent motion. It notes that Schneider Logistics Secretary-Treasurer Amy Schilling signed a sworn declaration saying the company had “no business or contractual relationship” with co-defendants Impact and Premier. And the motion alleges that Schneider sought to continue this image by failing to turn over documents during the discovery process that would have indicated otherwise. <PARAGRAPH> In April Schneider attorneys responded to a discovery request without actually looking for the requested documents, according to the motion. In other words, they allegedly were either sloppy or intentionally avoided turning over evidence to which the plaintiffs have a legal right. <PARAGRAPH> This became clear when documents turned over by Impact and Premier included highly relevant Schneider documents which Schneider attorneys had specifically said did not exist. The motion notes: <PARAGRAPH> Schneider has now produced thousands of documents it previously claimed did not exist, including over 12,100 pages of personnel files it maintained for the Impact and Premier class members (whom it claims not to jointly employ), and the workplace rules and training requirements it imposed on all class members. <PARAGRAPH> The plaintiffs say the new documents show that “Schneider’s top managers knowingly made material false statements” to the court, including claims that the warehouse employees are not subject to Schneider employment policies and that Schneider does not keep personnel files on them or set productivity quotas. The documents showed that Schilling herself signed contracts with Premier and Impact, on behalf of STLD and “its affiliates.” Meanwhile, Schilling is also vice president and controller of Schneider National, the parent company of the other Schneider groups, which actually negotiated the contracts with Impact and Premier. <PARAGRAPH> Once it was clear that Schneider did indeed have contracts with Impact and Premier, General Manager Vince Redgrave told the court that the contracts gave Schneider no say over work terms or conditions. The court ordered that Schneider actually produce the contracts, and when it did, as the motion says, “they proved the exact opposite of what Vince Redgrave had testified.” <PARAGRAPH> The federal district judge, Christina Snyder, wrote in a preliminary injunction ruling that the “contracts dictate nearly every material term of plaintiffs’ employment including how Impact and PWV (Premier) must conduct pre-employment screening and new employment training.” <PARAGRAPH> The documents also showed that, contrary to Redgrave’s previous testimony, Schneider did set specific productivity quotas for the warehouse workers and in fact complained to Premier when the rate of cases unloaded per hour dropped. Schneider officials also talked about how to remedy Impact’s “low productivity levels.” <PARAGRAPH> Warehouse worker groups have long argued that unrealistic and escalating productivity quotas are among the things that lead to high chronic and acute injury rates in warehouses. In July, Warehouse Workers United filed a complaint with California’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration office. <PARAGRAPH> The recent motion also alleges that Schneider or its attorneys did not order employees to preserve emails relevant to the case, as is standard required legal procedure. It says the company has an automatic delete email function for emails from the Mira Loma warehouses, meaning emails are deleted automatically after a short period of time, and employees also have “absolute discretion” over whether to save or delete emails. The motion says Schneider was slow to issue a memo instating a “litigation hold”—meaning employees should preserve relevant communications. And it alleges even after such a memo was issued, Schneider never enforced it. <PARAGRAPH> The motion also alleges that Schneider destroyed and denied the existence of security camera footage that would aid the plaintiffs’ case. The motion demands that Schneider turn over video footage and also a log of any video that has been destroyed since October 2011. <PARAGRAPH> The motion asks that the court make note of Schneider’s alleged misconduct, tell Schneider that further misconduct will result in sanctions, and provide relevant attorneys’ fees and costs to the plaintiffs. It notes that the court could also decide to inform a jury of Schneider’s false statements and other discovery violations, and asks that the court establish a “rebuttal presumption” that Schneider is indeed a “joint employer” of the plaintiffs. <PARAGRAPH> Overall, the lawsuit is part of WWU’s and individual workers’ ongoing campaign to improve conditions in warehouses and shed light on the complicated employment structure that allows major companies like Wal-Mart to benefit from the low-paid, dangerous work of a largely temporary workforce.
City Janitors Are Latest To Feel Sting of Emanuel’s Cost-Cutting | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO—Pam Broughton worked for eight years as a janitor at the Fifth District police station on the city's far south side. As of this spring she was making $15.45 an hour with benefits. But then as a cost-cutting measure, the city accepted a bid from a different contractor that offered to clean the station more cheaply than Nationwide Maintenance, the contracting company that employed Broughton. <PARAGRAPH> The new company, Dayspring Janitorial Services, told workers that if they wanted to keep their jobs they would have to agree to $12 an hour, no benefits and more part-time work, Broughton says. She said the workers, members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 1, accepted the conditions “because we needed jobs.” <PARAGRAPH> Even so, Broughton’s last day of work was June 29. <PARAGRAPH> Broughton says she never got a straight answer from the city or Dayspring about whether she would be able to keep her job. About 50 union janitors were laid off as the city granted contracts to Dayspring to clean south side police stations, health clinics, senior centers and administrative satellite offices. Others were rehired by Dayspring, but will see their pay drop from $24,100 to $31,000 a year currently, depending on their seniority, to a maximum of $23,800 per year with Dayspring.  It is also unclear whether the rehired workers will have health insurance; the union said Dayspring is still negotiating with the city on this point. Many of those laid off had been in their jobs for decades. <PARAGRAPH> Broughton and seven other janitors at the fifth district station were laid off despite a letter from Station Commander Patricia Walsh saying they were “dependable and conscientious in fulfilling their daily responsibilities…also very responsive to the special maintenance requests and cleaning needs of the 5th District personnel.” <PARAGRAPH> Union leaders say the janitors’ situation shows how the city bidding system lends itself to union-busting. Hence Broughton and other janitors and supporters rallied at Chicago City Hall on Wednesday to demand that the city council hold a hearing on the Responsible Bidders Ordinance, which would mandate contractors doing business with the city prove that they have not violated federal or state labor law and that they are paying the prevailing industry wage. <PARAGRAPH>They note that Dayspring has a history of alleged and proven labor law violations under past county contracts, including citations from the National Labor Relations Board for “intimidating, coercing, discriminating and illegally terminating its employees in order to prevent them from speaking with and joining a union,” as summed up in a union press release. (The NLRB settled with Dayspring on those charges.) Dayspring was also charged with violating state policy by not paying prevailing wage rates while working under a 2007 contract cleaning county health clinics. The company paid $11.15 per hour, while prevailing wage was set at $11.40 for new employees and up to $14.80 for longer-term workers. <PARAGRAPH> “For eight months we were corresponding with the city about Dayspring’s record,” says SEIU spokesperson Izabela Miltko “Either a) they made a huge mistake or b) they sought out this contractor ultimately looking to get rid of the union.” <PARAGRAPH> The ordinance would apply to all contracts over $50,000 for window-washing, security and janitorial services, and would require companies pay a prevailing wage, comply with labor law and carry workers compensation and other crucial insurance. It would disqualify companies with past labor law violations or multiple violations of the prevailing wage standard. It would also mandate that no existing employees be replaced by a new contractor during a 45-day transition period; and if people are laid off during this period, it must be done on the basis of seniority. <PARAGRAPH> The ordinance has the support of 31 out of the city’s 50 aldermen, according to the union, but it needs to be called for a committee hearing in order to go to a full Council vote. So far that has not happened, and the way things go in Chicago it also needs the mayor’s support. <PARAGRAPH> “We’ll deliver our message to Mr. Emanuel, we’ll tell him to look for savings elsewhere, not in our pockets because our pockets are almost empty,” says Ewa Miklewicz, a janitor and union member for more than three decades. <PARAGRAPH> Unions see the ordinance as especially important as the city is under intense budget pressure and expected to privatize more city services, meaning more contractors will be hired. Currently union janitors at the city’s two airports are also worried about losing their jobs. A contract for janitorial services at O’Hare International airport recently expired and a leading bid by the company United Maintenance Company Inc. would reportedly mean about 340 SEIU Local 1 janitors lose their jobs. Union president Tom Balanoff told the Chicago Tribune that company officials told him they would hire their own, likely non-union workers. <PARAGRAPH> “Every time you look up, a little part of the city workforce has been chopped away,” says Charles Brown, a former police officer who lives in the Englewood neighborhood on the city’s south side and who attended the janitors’ rally. “Chicago has a wonderful tradition of valuing hard work. Public contractors should not be leading the race to the bottom, the public workforce should set the standards…These (janitors) had good jobs and they were nice ladies and gentlemen. This irresponsible company hired replacement workers and didn’t honor the terms of their contract. And so far the city hasn’t done a D-A-M-N thing.” <PARAGRAPH> The union charges that based on their research, even with the low wages, Dayspring will not be able to fulfill the terms it promised the city in its bid. The union says the company also didn’t follow the law in considering prevailing wages in its bid proposal. On June 8 the union filed a Freedom of Information Act with the city for documents related to the bid. Though FOIAs must legally be answered within seven working days, the union says they have still received no response. <PARAGRAPH> “It’s obvious Mayor Emanuel is not going to do the right thing on his own, so we have to push him,” says organizer Laura Garza. <PARAGRAPH> The letter to the mayor cited the plight of Catalina Bojorquez, a janitor for three years at the city’s 63rd Street police station who lost her job and her health insurance with the contract switch. She recently discovered she has an ovarian tumor and may need surgery. <PARAGRAPH> Broughton is now surviving on $167 a month in disability payments—or barely surviving, since she has diabetes and no health insurance. <PARAGRAPH> “We’re asking the mayor to pass this ordinance so I can get my job back,” she told the crowd outside city hall. “I like my job.”
Chicago Teachers Move Toward Strike (Updated) | <PARAGRAPH> Update: On Wednesday, August 29, Chicago Teachers Union president Karen Lewis filed 10-day notice of a strike. <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO–There was palpable excitement in the air as teachers in red union T-shirts streamed into the formidable stone-and-brick structure that is Chicago's Lane Tech College Prep High School on the evening of Aug. 22. <PARAGRAPH> Inside, delegates from schools across the city would vote later that night to give union president Karen Lewis the authority to give the 10 days notice required for a strike. The majority of schools start the day after Labor Day, Sept. 4, so a first-day strike would require notice almost immediately. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> An advance battle has already begun at the district’s “Track E” institutions, which are back in session despite a sweltering heat wave and a lack of air conditioning in many classrooms. This week the union has been printing up strike posters in preparation and holding informational pickets at the Track E schools. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, district administrators distributed a memo to principals asking them to report union activity such as work slowdowns, “sick outs” and “other job actions that undermine supervisory authority and deleteriously affect the mission and goals of the Chicago public school system.” On Aug. 22 the Board of Education voted to authorize spending $25 million on “student safety” and student meals in case of a strike, with programming offered at non-school locations such as libraries and churches. <PARAGRAPH> The fight over a longer school day for Chicago students has largely been resolved. To lengthen the school day without requiring teachers to work longer hours, the district will rehire teachers who had previously been laid off. But contract negotiations are still not going well, according to the union, with the two sides at loggerheads over issues such as salary, class size and teacher evaluation by student performance. <PARAGRAPH> “This has been really hard, because none of us want to go out” on strike, says bargaining team member Susan Hickey, a clinician. <PARAGRAPH> Xian Barrett, who teaches law and Chicago history at Gage Park High School in a rough neighborhood on the city’s South Side, says, “From day-to-day working with kids, I hope there’s not a strike.” <PARAGRAPH> But he sees the struggle in a bigger context. “In terms of caring about these students’ long term futures, and the future of their kids and their kids’ kids, I think a strike is a necessary step in taking the schools back.” <PARAGRAPH> Like many teachers, Barrett sees the fight over contract issues as part of a larger battle over the whole shape of public education in Chicago, including whose voices are heard and whose interests are served. In Chicago, as in many cities, union teachers and many parents are speaking out against the growth of non-union charter schools, the evaluation of teachers based largely on student performance on standardized tests and the closing of “under-performing” neighborhood schools. Union leaders and progressive education experts say that the Chicago school system has become more corporate and top-down and less responsive to teacher and parent concerns ever since 1995, when the mayor’s office was given control of the system.  <PARAGRAPH> Barrett was a founding member of the progressive group CORE (Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators) that won leadership of the Chicago Teachers Union in a hotly contested 2010 election. Since then the union has pushed back hard against city plans to close schools and increase the number of charters. <PARAGRAPH> According to Barrett and many other teachers, tensions intensified after Emanuel took office in May 2011. <PARAGRAPH> “He is ridiculous,” said Jeanine Trize, who has worked as a teacher’s aide in the schools for 22 years. “How can you come into a system you know nothing about and without working with the teachers and students just start changing things? We don’t have money to put our kids in private school like he does. We should be the ones deciding what happens in the public schools, not him.” <PARAGRAPH> Barrett grew up around the labor movement. His mother was a National Education Association organizing director in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois and his father is a labor historian. He got his first taste of teaching in the JET program in Japan, where he taught English and human rights. He started at the Chicago public schools in 2006 and became quickly disillusioned with the union leadership. When other young progressive teachers invited him to participate in what would become the founding meeting of CORE--“just 10 people sitting around a small table, where we chose the name and everything"--he was excited that “I had found a cool group of troublemakers who could help offer something new to students.” <PARAGRAPH> In 2009 he was chosen as a Classroom Teaching Ambassador Fellow by the U.S. Department of Education; in 2010 he was fired by the Chicago schools. He says the principal told him it was because his students were skipping class–of their own volition–to attend Board of Education meetings about planned school closings. So Barrett turned his energies to working for the union. <PARAGRAPH> Barrett was one of the last to believe that CORE taking leadership of the union was a possible or a legitimate goal. But as CORE members became increasingly vocal in union business, the group rapidly gained popularity and converts. Their victory in the 2010 union elections was seen as a sign that teachers were hungry for leadership more willing to stand up to the city administration and the Board of Education. Now, they are possibly on the cusp of the union’s first strike in a quarter century, with nearly 90 percent of union members voting in June to authorize one. <PARAGRAPH> “I was just in Europe–in Belgium and England–and people were talking about this, it’s international news,” said special education teacher Sarah Chambers outside the delegates meeting. “I was also in New York, and lots of teachers were talking about it. And in Puerto Rico. They say if we go on strike, they will be here to support us.” <PARAGRAPH> After about two hours, teachers started walking out of Lane Tech into the packed parking lot. They seemed energized and determined. When Lewis appeared toward the tail end of the crowd, teachers clustered around her and cheered. <PARAGRAPH> The delegates had voted to grant her the authority to give 10-day notice for a strike. Whether she will do so in coming days remains to be seen, depending how contract negotiations go. Teachers leaving the meeting refrained from talking about what happened inside or the vote, but they unanimously expressed the sentiment that they are being driven to extreme measures by an administration they believe is intentionally picking a fight with the union rather than trying to resolve challenges facing the schools through a democratic process. <PARAGRAPH> “I don’t think [Emanuel] has the city’s and citizens’ best interest in mind,” said Tom Brady, an elementary school English teacher on the city’s far South side, who has worked for 24 years in the public school system. “Ultimately [former Mayor Richard M.] Daley did not want labor unrest. Emanuel is more willing to have labor unrest… It’s not just teachers, it’s also the librarians, and then the police and firefighters’ contracts are up next.” <PARAGRAPH> Chambers said other unions in the public schools and citywide are watching the teachers' struggle as a bellwether of things to come. <PARAGRAPH> “If they take us down, they take everyone down,” she said. “There are 19 unions in the schools. Our contracts affect the working conditions and contracts for everyone else.” <PARAGRAPH> Other public-sector unions and community groups have rallied behind the teachers, and surveys have shown that parents strongly support the teachers’ position. <PARAGRAPH> Barrett said, “People call Rahm the best union organizer we ever had.”
Rahm Emanuel’s ‘Leaky Jobs Pipeline’ Exposed | <PARAGRAPH> During Rahm Emanuel’s first year-plus as Chicago mayor, his office has issued a steady stream of press releases about corporations moving to downtown. Emanuel’s office says 20,000 new jobs will be created by eight major companies shifting their headquarters there and 28 more companies significantly expanding downtown operations. <PARAGRAPH> But on August 19 the Chicago Tribune deflated many of Emanuel’s jobs claims with the front-page story “Mayor Emanuel’s Jobs Pipeline Somewhat Leaky.” <PARAGRAPH> As the Tribune reported, in several prominent cases the shift of jobs from the suburbs to downtown Chicago actually meant serious net job cuts for the region. The paper explains: <PARAGRAPH> While about 60 percent of [Emanuel’s] job pledges are for new positions, the remainder likely will be transfers—good for the city but not providing direct opportunities for the 1 in 10 Chicagoans who are out of work and looking for jobs in a soggy economy. Moreover, of the new jobs, more than 1,700 of the positions the mayor counts are construction jobs, which aren't permanent. Of all the announced jobs, 2,200 are with companies that failed to provide a definitive date on when they would finish the hiring, and about 3,600 are on phased timetables that could stretch beyond 2015, raising the question of how firm those pledges could be. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The Tribune, In These Times and other outlets have reported the details of some of these "leaky" transfers: <PARAGRAPH> In 2011 Emanuel used between $5 and $6.5 million in TIF money to convince Sara Lee Corporation to bring the headquarters of its North American Meats company back to downtown Chicago after six years in the suburbs. But with the move, the company cut almost half of the meat division's staff–from a total of about 1,000 at its suburban headquarters to between 500 and 650 at the new downtown location. In July 2012 Google Inc. announced it would move its Motorola Mobility division with 3,000 employees to Chicago from suburban Libertyville. Then in August, Motorola Mobility reported it was slashing its international payroll by 20 percent, including eliminating about 650 to 700 jobs that had been expected to move from Libertyville to Chicago. Libertyville workers said they were confused and stunned by the mixed messages, especially since just a year earlier Illinois governor Pat Quinn had offered the company $100 million in tax incentives to stay in Libertyville. The Tribune also featured the case of Lawson Products, which in late 2011 promised to relocate its headquarters from suburban Des Plaines to Chicago. Emanuel called it "a significant commitment to the city,” but the Tribune noted that “the move amounted to shifting the company from one side of the Tri-State Tollway to the other.” Lawson, which makes hose fittings, hydraulics and other industrial supplies, transferred about 400 employees to the new Chicago headquarters in spring 2012. But a few months later, it laid off about 100 employees, including many at the Chicago headquarters. Nationwide, media and industry report that companies are opting to locate their headquarters downtown instead of in suburbs because of the growing popularity–especially for young professionals–of living in previously industrial or downtrodden “inner cities” now blooming with rehabbed lofts and new galleries and sidewalk cafes. <PARAGRAPH> Perhaps this was part of the logic–along with about $31 million in tax increment financing (TIF) dollars from Chicago taxpayers–when United Airlines decided to move its corporate headquarters from the suburbs to Chicago’s Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower). <PARAGRAPH> But when companies like United Airlines move huge operations including many long-time employees from the suburbs to downtown, many of those employees will continue to live in the suburbs. And they likely will usually commute straight home after work, without patronizing Chicago stores or restaurants where they theoretically would stimulate more job creation. Even when these commuters do hang around after work and spend money in Chicago, in such an upscale area they will likely be spending money at high-end and chain establishments that do little to augment the fortunes of regular Chicago workers or mom-and-pop store owners.
Not-For-Profit Hospitals Make Billions—and Provide Little Charity Care | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Not-for-profit hospitals, including some of the country’s biggest and best-known institutions, are almost entirely tax exempt, in part because of the expectation they will provide free or low-cost “charity care" to those in need. But a report released this week by a research arm of California Nurses Association / National Nurses United found that California not-for-profit hospitals are reaping huge tax benefits while providing minimal charity care. <PARAGRAPH> Many people don’t realize that not-for-profit institutions can accumulate profits. They can; the profit cannot be disbursed to individual owners or stockholders but rather is supposed to be reinvested for the good of the community. With hospitals, that is generally assumed to include the provision of charity care to uninsured or low-income people. But while 11 states, including Texas and Alabama, mandate specific levels of charity care, California and the federal government do not. <PARAGRAPH> As a result, not-for-profit tax breaks for well-known California hospitals–including Cedars Sinai, Kaiser Permanente and Stanford University--dwarf the level of charity care provided. Overall, the 196 hospitals surveyed received $3.3 billion in 2010 state and federal tax exemptions and spent only $1.4 billion on charity care--a gap of $1.8 billion. Three-quarters of the hospitals got more dollars in tax breaks than they spent on charity care. Half spent less than 2.46 percent of their operating expenses on charity care. <PARAGRAPH> The tax breaks hurt financially strapped counties and towns; according to the report, California counties and municipalities lost about $1 billion in tax revenue they would have otherwise collected in 2010. Public budgets suffer when large institutions don’t pay taxes, and budget crunches are often taken out on public workers, as well as those who rely on the services they provide. Counties or cities also end up essentially picking up the tab for health care when impoverished patients can’t pay and hospitals either deny care–diverting the patients elsewhere–or insist on billing. The report notes that California counties and towns paid $450 million in 2010 to for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals for care for people who could not pay their medical bills. <PARAGRAPH> All of these spillover effects concern National Nurses United, whose mission includes patient advocacy and "accessible, quality healthcare for all." Spokesperson Chuck Idelson told In These Times, “Nurses see what happens to their patients and their communities when these giant corporate hospitals behave more like Lehman Brothers or JP Morgan than a community service. For example, Sutter Health has engaged in widespread slashing of mental health services, women’s services, children’s services–cuts that will make them profits." <PARAGRAPH> The nurses' union proposes California legislation that would force not-for-profit hospitals to beef up their charity care if they want to maintain their tax exemptions. It wants hospitals to spend at least 8 percent of revenues on charity care, echoing a proposal made by the state attorney general in 2006. The nurses are also demanding more transparency in how hospitals report and define their charity care, to exclude the "promotional activities or cost containment (interpreted by many hospitals as cutting services)" that are currently counted. Violations of charity care obligations could be punished by fines and/or the revoking of tax exempt status. <PARAGRAPH> To those who wish to support NNU's efforts, Idelson says, "You can contact your legislator to insist they pass legislation, and tell the non-profit hospitals to cease their practices of putting profits and executive pay over charity care." <PARAGRAPH> While California relies more heavily than most states on not-for-profit hospitals, which take in 70 percent of California patients, the nurses union says that similar situations exist nationwide. In 2004 I wrote for the Chicago Reader about the religious, not-for-profit chain Advocate denying charity care to people in need–billing them for their care, and then suing them and garnishing their wages when they couldn’t pay bills that were actually larger than insured people would have been given for the same service. <PARAGRAPH> Earlier this month scores of union nurses, in their trademark red garb, attended the release of a report by the state auditor on charity care. At the hearing, State Board of Equalization member Betty Yee noted that not-for-profit hospitals actually often provide less charity care than for-profit institutions. <PARAGRAPH> Many for-profit hospitals have taken a hit during the economic crisis, in part because of rising numbers of uninsured and desperate patients whom they are legally obligated to treat. (One exception, as The New York Times reported this week, is the HCA chain owned by Bain Capital, which has made huge profits largely through cutting services and staffing.) <PARAGRAPH> Idelson stressed that the debate shouldn’t be about the merits of for-profit versus not-for-profit health care systems, but rather public versus private ones. “If you look at the level of charity care and other community benefits and pricing practices, the difference between private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals is very small," she says. "But the difference between private and public systems is massive. The institutions that are really acting in a way people think hospitals should behave are the hard-pressed county and public hospital systems.” <PARAGRAPH> Idelson noted that while the union’s recommendations are necessary for the immediate future, the overall crisis just underscores the need for revamping the country’s entire private, profit-based health care system. <PARAGRAPH> “No one should have to worry about getting access to medical care. You should not see services arbitrarily cut because they are not profitable services. In the long term the only solution is transforming our healthcare system into the type most countries have–which is a national single-payer system.”
Chicago: Occupiers of Mental Health Clinics Face Trial | <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO--On Tuesday, N’Dana Carter and others arrested for occupying the now-shuttered public mental health clinic in Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood headed to court on charges of criminal trespassing. The bench trial was postponed until October. Meanwhile, Carter’s rage at clinic closings--and what they say about the city’s priorities--continues to grow. <PARAGRAPH> Six of the city’s 12 public mental health clinics were closed this year and scores of union staff laid off, including disproportionately high numbers of Black and Latino workers. <PARAGRAPH> Carter and others say the impacts on low-income, minority South and West Side neighborhoods have been severe. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> “The city of Chicago made a hit on the African American community when they decided to fire every African-American male therapist," Carter tells In These Times. "Who is the first to be arrested in the city of Chicago? African-American males. And upon release from prison, there’s often a requirement to seek mental health therapy. Therapy is successful because you develop a healthy relationship with your therapist. These are people who have been displaced, disrespected, locked up for some years; do you really think they’ll be able to relate to white women, white men?” <PARAGRAPH> As part of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s inaugural 2012 budget, the clinics were closed to save a reported $3 million. Just before Christmas last year, The Chicago Reporter revealed the details: planned layoffs of 208 workers in the city Department of Public Health, due to both the menta-health clinic closures and the privatization of public primary care health clinics. <PARAGRAPH> Carter told In These Times, "Some of the people laid off had been on the job 20 or 25 years. They had substantial relationships with their patients. People could call their therapists at any hour. Therapists that would buy food out of their own pocket for their clients. It wasn’t a casual relationship, they were loving intense relationships. Now [many of the patients] won’t even come outside, they won’t talk, it’s painful to see. We’re looking at people who are literally falling apart while the city is saying, ‘That’s your problem–you shouldn’t be sick, you shouldn’t be mentally ill.’” <PARAGRAPH> (Read AFSCME’s reports on the impact of the closures here.) <PARAGRAPH> The clinic cuts are among the most high-profile public service cuts and privatizations being undertaken by the Emanuel administration in order to address the city’s gaping budget hole. But grassroots groups point out that while cutting public services, the city continues its tradition of doling out millions in taxpayer dollars to wealthy corporations under the tax increment financing (TIF) program. <PARAGRAPH> TIFs are meant to stimulate “blighted” neighborhoods by setting aside a portion of property tax dollars to subsidize local business growth. But for years, critics have charged the federal program is grossly misused in Chicago, with subsidies going to major corporations in already-thriving and upscale areas that could hardly qualify as “blighted.” Last week In These Times reported on Chicago union members protesting TIF dollars given to United Airlines and Coors/Miller Lite in the downtown “LaSalle Central” district. <PARAGRAPH> The city is also spending a total of $20 million in TIF dollars for commercial redevelopment around the University of Chicago, not far from the now-shuttered Woodlawn mental health clinic that members of the Mental Health Movement occupied in April. Clinic patients and their supporters can’t help but notice that just a fraction of this TIF subsidy could theoretically keep all six mental health clinics open. Meanwhile, residents of the adjacent low-income, largely African American neighborhoods such as Woodlawn say that they are being pushed out by the university’s development policies. <PARAGRAPH> It is unclear whether TIF money could legally be diverted to public services like clinics. But critics suggest simply cancelling inappropriate TIFs so the property tax dollars can be used as usual for public resources.
Global Hyatt Boycott Heats Up | <PARAGRAPH> On July 23 unions and other labor and community groups called for a global boycott of Hyatt hotels, citing problematic working conditions and employment practices that they say violate labor laws and workers’ rights. The boycott is part of the Hyatt Hurts campaign centered around housekeepers, who suffer high rates of  injury and often make around minimum wage working for contractors with few or no benefits.  Indianapolis hotel cleaner Elvia Bahena, fired last week after speaking out at a community hearing, is just one of the workers who say they’ve been mistreated and retaliated against by Hyatt or its contractors. <PARAGRAPH> Bahena had worked for United Services Co., a company that contracts with Hyatt hotels to provide cleaners. On average, cleaners work on 24 rooms a day, with the contractor of course taking a cut of what Hyatt pays for their services. Hyatt and other Indianapolis hotels and contractors allegedly conspired to protect this system through a “black-listing” arrangement wherein the contract workers would not be directly hired by hotels even when direct-hire jobs became available. UNITE HERE says the blacklisting kept about 1,000 local workers trapped in minimum-wage jobs with no hope of advancement. Bahena made $8 an hour after 11 years in the industry. She previously worked at the Westin and Marriott hotels, where she also worked for a contractor. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> On July 16 the Indianapolis city council passed an ordinance outlawing the blacklisting practice. Bahena had spoken in favor of the ordinance at a community hearing where top hotel managers were present, and two weeks later she was fired. <PARAGRAPH> United Services later said Bahena was fired for performance issues and missing work, but UNITE HERE Indianapolis organizer Sarah Lyons says Bahena, 36, had only missed one day of work, when her son was sick, and had never been written up for performance reasons. <PARAGRAPH> “My three kids are all about to go back to school, there are a lot of supplies and uniforms to purchase, and I’m afraid I won’t be able to pay the rent,” Bahena says. <PARAGRAPH> Lyons says United Services has started “backpedaling,” saying Bahena is still on their roster, a sign local pressure around her case is having an effect. Bahena says she would rather work directly for the Hyatt, “for the benefits, to make a little more money and have real raises.” <PARAGRAPH> “The (direct-hire) hotel jobs tend to pay $1 or $2 more an hour – they’re not great jobs, but they do pay a little more at least,” Lyons says. <PARAGRAPH> Hyatt workers and their supporters held demonstrations across the country last week around the boycott announcement. In many cities there have been boycotts and one-day strikes at Hyatts for several years, including at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, which houses a unionized Hyatt hotel. Last summer the Hyatt Park Hotel in Chicago turned on heat lamps over striking workers on a sweltering June day, a move hotel managers said was a mistake and workers said was an intimidation tactic. <PARAGRAPH> The global boycott coincides with a social media campaign to vote Hyatt the “worst hotel employer in America.”  In addition to being supported by the AFL-CIO and Change to Win coalition, the boycott and social media campaign are also backed by the NFL Players Association—whose members presumably have stayed in countless hotels during their careers—and other groups, including the National Organization of Women, MoveOn.org, Netroots Nation, American Rights at Work, the Courage Campaign, the United Farm Workers, Making Change at Walmart and the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs. <PARAGRAPH> Regarding the NFL Players’ support, the Hyatt Hurts website notes: <PARAGRAPH> [NFL Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice] Smith emphasized that NFL players know what it’s like to work in pain, and that they recently faced their own “speedup” when the owners wanted them to play an extra two games per season. He noted that only by joining together were the players able to defeat the owners’ proposal: “We’ve learned the same lessons that these housekeepers know. That if they stick together and fight for what’s right, they have a chance. If they try to fight by themselves, if they let a corporation divide them, it will be worse for everyone.” <PARAGRAPH> About 30 percent of Hyatts in major markets are unionized, according to UNITE HERE, compared to about 40 percent of Hilton and Starwood hotels. As relationships with the company have deteriorated, most of the unionized Hyatt workers have been working without a contract for up to three years. Lyons says that Starwood and Hilton have offered thousands of their workers “a fair process to unionize” recently, whereas Hyatt has “allowed only about 500 workers that right.” <PARAGRAPH> Indianapolis is the largest U.S. city without a union hotel, according to UNITE HERE. The boycott does not include two Hawaii Hyatts that have contracts with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and a number of Hyatts with UNITE HERE contracts. <PARAGRAPH> The use of increasing use of contractors has dovetailed with increasing workloads for cleaners, increasing their risk of injuries and attracting the attention of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration. <PARAGRAPH> “The worst days are Sundays and Mondays when people have just checked out and the rooms are really messy,” says Bahena, who is also a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in January against Hyatt, other Indianapolis hotels and the contractor Hospitality Staffing Solutions.  “After a Sunday, I feel really, really tired. After a long day my feet and my knees hurt.” <PARAGRAPH> UNITE HERE says that Hyatt’s practices are particularly harmful to women, who make up a majority of the cleaning workforce and allege they are often retaliated against and discriminated against. Ten thousand people worldwide have signed a petition in support of two Santa Clara Hyatt cleaners who were fired after they complained about digitally altered photos of them in bikinis posted on a hotel bulletin board. <PARAGRAPH> Academics in gender and women’s studies (and other fields) wrote a letter casting this incident in the context of widespread abuses of women workers at Hyatt hotels, saying: <PARAGRAPH> The sexualization of housekeepers by Hyatt management is an appalling expression of power that has no place at work. It has tangible physical as well as psychological impacts. It belongs to a long list of well-documented abusive and unsafe practices that Hyatt housekeepers, many of them women of color, all over the country endure. <PARAGRAPH> Cathy Youngblood, a 61-year-old housekeeper at the Hyatt Andraz on the Sunset Strip, sees the working conditions of housekeepers as a clear-cut women’s rights issue. (Click here to learn more about Youngblood and other Hyatt workers.) <PARAGRAPH> “The way Hyatt treats its women housekeepers is like an unidentified, unspoken attack on women, immigrants, and minorities,” Youngblood says. “I came through the Civil Rights era—that taught me how to speak up, especially when I think a workforce is being abused. Hyatt doesn’t like the word abuse, but that is what they are doing to women, immigrants and minorities.”
Hyatt Worker Cathy Youngblood: We’re Not Going To Stop “Until We Get What We Need” | <PARAGRAPH> Cathy Youngblood refers to herself as a “late bloomer.” She got two associate degrees earlier in life, but went back to school and obtained two bachelors degrees in Anthropology and African Studies in her late 50s. She graduated just as the economy was collapsing, however, and her dreams of finding work in her fields were dashed. She got a retail job but when her hours were cut to four per week it became unsustainable. <PARAGRAPH> A friend told her about an open house for jobs in the hospitality industry, sponsored by Hyatt Hotels and the UNITE HERE union, which is now calling for a global boycott of Hyatts as part of its Hyatt Hurts campaign. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood says she found out the hotel chain was looking for more “diversity” in its workforce, and as an African-American woman she was covered. She went to a one week “boot camp” connected to the initiative, and then was hired as a housekeeper at the Andaz West Hollywood on the Sunset Strip just as her unemployment benefits were running out. She noted that many people don’t realize the chain of Andaz “boutique luxury” hotels around the country are actually owned by Hyatt. With 239 rooms and about 33 housekeepers, the Andaz West Hollywood is smaller than most of the Hyatt hotels. <PARAGRAPH> It didn’t take long for Youngblood, 61, to become disillusioned with the work. Not surprisingly it was physically taxing, cleaning 13 rooms a day at a fast pace and lifting heavy mattresses because the hotel chain has resisted buying fitted sheets which could make the job much easier. <PARAGRAPH> But it wasn’t the physical hardship that upset Youngblood most. Rather it was the way she thought the company treated its workers, particularly the immigrant women who make up a large portion of the housecleaning staff. She says she got the impression the hotel chain had avoided hiring African-American workers because managers figured immigrants would be a more “docile” workforce. <PARAGRAPH> “Most black people in this country will speak up on the job because they’re citizens and know their rights, they know the labor laws and what they mean,” she says. <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood wasn’t afraid to speak out, and neither were many of her immigrant coworkers. Workers at their hotel are among the roughly 30 percent of Hyatts where housekeepers belong to the UNITE HERE union; many of them have been working without a contract for three years. At non-union Hyatts, Youngblood and other workers and union staff say, workers are expected to clean more rooms per day, as many as 40. <PARAGRAPH> One day in March 2011 at the Andaz West Hollywood, workers were ordered to clean 15 rooms a day, two more than previously. But they wouldn’t take it. <PARAGRAPH> “We protested, we voiced our opinions, we marched up to the general manager’s office single file to show solidarity,” Youngblood says. “One of the people from HR came out and said if we didn’t go back to work and do what we were told we might face severe discipline, including  termination. We didn’t like that, but we went back to work that day because we didn’t want to be fired.” <PARAGRAPH> They filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, which resulted this January in a settlement in the workers’ favor leading to a 13-room cap and other protections reinstated from their expired contract. <PARAGRAPH> “It was really quite a feat for 30 women to go to the Hyatt and manage to get them to lower the room count, ” Youngblood says. “It sent a strong message to Hyatt, it scared them. That’s monumental.” <PARAGRAPH> If management were cowed by that experience, they likely did not know what else was in store. On July 23 UNITE HERE and other labor, community and interfaith groups – including the NFL Players Association -- called  for the global boycott of Hyatt hotels until they improve their labor practices. Youngblood thinks “the timing is right,” and notes that Hyatt workers in the United States already were communicating and organizing with Hyatt workers in India, Israel and the Philippines even before the global boycott. <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood hopes the international attention will persuade Hyatt higher-ups to meet with regular workers. <PARAGRAPH> “I would love to have a meeting with (Hyatt family heir, board member and Chicago philanthropist) Penny Pritzker, but then I’m a woman of color and I’m lower wage, maybe she thinks I don’t have enough education,” says Youngblood. “They’re a billionaire company, they have a different mindset. I think it’s ignorant. They should know by now there is worker dissatisfaction within the Hyatt family. They could get on a plane and come in here and say ‘Ok ladies, what’s going on?’ But instead they just talk about all their awards and accolades and diversity, and don’t want to hear the real story.” <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood says the solutions to many of their problems are not complicated—for example, buying fitted sheets and a wider range of cleaning equipment with shorter or longer handles appropriate for workers of different heights. <PARAGRAPH> “The tools are out there on the market – it’s not like you have to go out and invent them. But maybe some of the tools are more expensive than others.” <PARAGRAPH> She says most guests don’t realize how taxing it is to make a hotel bed lifting the 100-pound-plus mattress to tuck in flat sheets. “It’s not like making your bed at home. When you’re done with your sixth room your back is out of whack.” <PARAGRAPH>  Youngblood notes that the work has a mental impact along with the physical effects: <PARAGRAPH> “Like the other workers I do pride myself on how well we do our work, how clean a room is,” Youngblood says. “And there are inspections. Because you have to go so fast, you pray you won’t forget to leave soap or do something in the room. You’re working at such an incredible fast pace, it takes an emotional toll. When you consistently have to rush rush rush, it has a psychological effect.” <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood says hotel managers seem surprised that she is working as a housekeeper given her educational achievements and goals. She usually doesn’t tell them that she is now planning to get a doctorate in women’s studies, with her experience at the Hyatt, and her interviews with fellow workers, as the centerpiece of her thesis. But aside from the “field work” she is able to do related to her job, Youngblood is determined to stick with this fight until the end. <PARAGRAPH> “If I quit who’s going to take my place, another woman? And then the problem of abuse on the job will not be solved. I think if you can get through this life and make it a little easier for your children and grandchildren and other women and men coming behind you…I in all good conscience just can’t quit because of the way other women have shown love toward me. I do not want to leave housekeeping until we get what we need. I’m talking worldwide. I don’t want any housekeeper to suffer like we have suffered.”
Making Health Care Reform Work: A Perspective from California Doctors | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> LOS ANGELES—At a conference convened by the organization Reporting on Health at the University of Southern California this week, doctors and health care experts shed light on labor-related aspects of the health care field as the sweeping health care reform legislation is set to take effect after being upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. <PARAGRAPH> They provided a window into the workplace stresses and challenges doctors themselves have faced in our tumultuous and trouble-plagued health care system, and also the health care needs and challenges of low-income workers. <PARAGRAPH> Marcia Sablan, a doctor in the tiny northern California town of Firebaugh, embodies both of these narratives. Marcia is one of many doctors who depended on a federal program that helps people afford medical school in exchange for working in under-served rural districts. After her residency at the University of Hawaii, she was assigned to Firebaugh, in the agricultural valley of Fresno County, with a population then of just over 3,000. She was accompanied by her husband, also a doctor and the first native of Saipan to graduate from a U.S. medical school. <PARAGRAPH> Panelists at the conference noted that such programs will be increasingly important if the government wants to encourage more doctors to go into general primary care rather than becoming specialists. Specialists make an estimated $3.5 million more over their lifetimes, yet there will be an estimated shortage of 30,000 primary care doctors in coming years especially as more people become insured under the new health care law. <PARAGRAPH> Sablan arrived in Firebaugh in 1981 and eventually founded her own private practice there, where she primarily serves low-income Latino farmworkers, about half of them immigrants, including many uninsured people who may or may not end up insured under the health care bill reforms. Doctors and experts at the USC conference echoed the widespread concern that due to the way the health care reform bill and Supreme Court decision played out, people living under the poverty line may not get insurance under the new law. That’s because the insurance exchanges and subsidies the law mandates are designated for people who make more than the poverty line, while people making below the poverty line (including childless adults —a change from the past) are all supposed to be covered by Medicaid. <PARAGRAPH> States are ordered to expand their Medicaid programs to cover people making up to 133 percent of the poverty line, but the mandate doesn't have strong teeth since it is unclear if or how the federal government can punish states that don't expand their Medicaid programs to cover the newly eligible people. Many states say they cannot afford their share of the expansion plus the extra costs expected when currently eligible but un-enrolled people “come out of the woodwork” thanks to the publicity around the reform law. <PARAGRAPH> Sablan notes that she never asks her patients about immigration status—she is not required to under California’s Medicaid law—and she typically charges a $50 fee which most patients pay out of pocket. <PARAGRAPH> “Undocumented workers know not to leave a trail, not to leave bills,” she said. <PARAGRAPH> But when her patients need specialty care, the seasonal nature of farm work can cause serious problems. Many of them do have insurance during the months they are employed, but not during the off-months, she said. In her early years in Firebaugh, many of the locals were migrant workers living in labor camps who returned to Mexico or otherwise left Firebaugh for half the year. But the labor camps have been demolished and now many farmworkers have bought homes and live year-round in the town with their families, even as they continue to depend on seasonal agricultural wages. Hence an illness or injury that keeps them away from work for days or weeks during the crucial seasonal employment period is especially devastating financially. <PARAGRAPH> “What does an agricultural-based seasonal economy mean to a doctor practicing there?” Sablan asked, noting that Firebaugh’s population now numbers 6,741: 88 percent Latino, 22 percent living below the poverty line, more than a third unemployed and almost two-thirds without a high school diploma. “It means people have insurance and Medi-Cal (California’s version of Medicaid) at certain seasons of the year. But we know diseases don’t work like that. So this is a huge problem for us—seasonal workers have a very difficult time keeping up with chronic diseases.” <PARAGRAPH> From a health perspective, Sablan is glad to see the valley’s once-thriving cotton industry decline, she said, since it involves heavy pesticide use that raised serious health problems for workers and other residents. Once she treated victims of what was known as the worst pesticide-poisoning case in state history—28 workers critically poisoned after being ordered to return to a field too soon after it had been sprayed with phosphates. Now almonds and pistachios are the main crops in the area, grown mostly by huge industrial farms. (Meanwhile a sustainable cotton project has been in the works.) <PARAGRAPH> Sablan hopes the health care reform law will indeed result in better preventative care for low-income and currently uninsured people. She cites the case of one patient, a 54-year-old farmworker who had a heart attack and was prescribed medication which, at $400 a week, he could never afford. Also suffering from diabetes and lacking medication, he eventually had another heart attack and ending up needing permanent dialysis by age 60. <PARAGRAPH> “When you think about the Obama plan, think about [the farmworker] – do we want to be upstream or downstream?” in health care spending, she asked. “Someone paid for him to be in the hospital two times and on dialysis, which costs about a million dollars a year. He’s totally disabled now, unable to work, from what should have been a preventable situation.” <PARAGRAPH> Despite such challenges, Sablan and her husband feel lucky to work in an environment where they have treated three generations of patients —it gives them a sense of personal connection and continuity that other doctors say they lack when forced to see up to 30 patients a day, in the common “fee for service” health care model. <PARAGRAPH> Dr. Ken Kim described the challenges of working in a typical profit-driven, urban system. He and other internists were disgusted to see how badly many of their patients were faring under the standard health care model. He described multiple diabetic patients with legs amputated because they were shuffled between specialists, waiting for months for appointments, while a “pin-sized” wound became infected and festered. And he described elderly patients unable to comply with a doctor’s orders because they lacked a ride to the clinic or couldn’t open medicine bottles with arthritic hands or ate high-sodium meals as shut-ins. Doctors and nurses want to help such patients with personalized care, he indicated, but the fee-for-service model and other aspects of the traditional insurance system create so much time pressure that patients fall through the cracks. <PARAGRAPH> So Kim and other doctors formed an “accountable care organization” (ACO) wherein insurance companies like Blue Cross pay the organization a flat fee to provide care for a certain group of the insurance companies’ enrollees. Kim said that after floundering at first, the company, CareMore, where he now serves as chief medical officer, was able to provide holistic, preventative care to a patient base of mostly ailing senior citizens by subverting the fee for service model, focusing on prevention and making sure the various nurses and doctors working with a given patient communicate and develop a cohesive plan. He said that under their organization rates of hospital readmissions, amputations, mortality and other indicators have decreased drastically. Many hope this type of accountable care organization will become more common under the health reform law. <PARAGRAPH> While the general public is obviously confused about the implications of the health care reform bill, doctors and health care experts are also uncertain about how the law will play out and what it will mean for their own work lives and those of their patients.
Complaint Filed Against California Walmart Warehouse | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Workers stacking heavy boxes and driving forklifts in the dark. <PARAGRAPH> Thick black dust that causes nosebleeds and vomiting. <PARAGRAPH> Broken hand carts that give workers the choice between carrying heavy boxes by hand or struggling with carts so slow that they could be fired for not meeting strict piecework quotas. <PARAGRAPH> Emergency exits blocked by stacks of boxes and pallets. <PARAGRAPH> Workers stuck in stifling trailers for up to 30 minutes after heavy loaded pallets are stacked in front of the doors. <PARAGRAPH> Filthy bathrooms and water fountains, and no time to fill up water bottles while working in 95-degree temperatures. <PARAGRAPH> These are among the conditions documented at an Eastvale, California Walmart warehouse and outlined in a formal complaint filed with the California Department of Occupational Safety and Health on July 18 by the group Warehouse Workers United (WWU). <PARAGRAPH> The complaint demands a “wall-to-wall on-site inspection” of the warehouse, which is run by the same company—National Distribution Centers of Delaware, Inc.—that operates the four California warehouses charged with scores of serious health and safety violations and fined $256,000 by the state in January 2012. <PARAGRAPH> The violations and workplace policies described at the Eastvale warehouse are very similar to problems described at the other Walmart warehouses. <PARAGRAPH> “We’ve talked to hundreds of workers and inevitably the Walmart warehouses have the same types of working conditions—problems around wage and hour, health and safety violations and ongoing pressure to lower costs,” WWU organizer Guadalupe Palma told Working In These Times. “Inevitably that gets pushed down onto the workers. These warehouses are trying to keep up with what Walmart is asking for just to compete in the industry.” <PARAGRAPH> The complaint notes a July 12 incident involving worker Apolniar Rojas, who was seriously injured as he was backing a forklift out of a shipping container and the ramp he was backing onto slipped away. A passing manager told him not to go to the office until he had finished his job, according to the complaint, and then he was told to go to a Concentra Urgent Care Clinic affiliated with the warehouse 2.5 miles away. He had no car and could not find a ride on his own, so he walked in pain to the clinic, where he was diagnosed with a lumbar sprain, strained neck and shoulder sprain. <PARAGRAPH> The complaint notes that workers are regularly sent home after injuries without being told of their rights to be examined and covered under workers compensation laws. It says workers are told they will be laid off if “they cannot be counted on” to work with an injury. It also says workers are forced to drive forklifts and trucks without the proper training, and cites one worker—Miguel Gonzalez—who was seriously injured and then suspended for three days after a supervisor ordered him to drive a forklift without training. The complaint also notes that speed limits on forklifts are not enforced, and workers are forced to drive them dangerously at top speed or risk demotion. <PARAGRAPH> Like Gonzalez, many workers apparently find themselves in catch 22 situations. Palma said: <PARAGRAPH> There’s definitely a lot of pressure that gets placed from Walmart to move more boxes at higher rates of speed, and that leads to injuries. It’s not sustainable for a worker to continue to work at that pace without getting injured. Whether they report the injury or not, there’s retaliation. If they don’t report the injury they’ll try to keep up but they could be terminated or retaliated against if they’re not keeping up with the pace. And by continuing to work, they exacerbate the injury. If they do report the injury, there’s also retaliation and they often don’t get adequate medical care. <PARAGRAPH> The complaint also notes that workers are forced to pay for safety equipment out of pocket, with a photo of a price list showing $5 for a safety vest, $11 for an extra large vest, $4 for gloves and even $1 for four pens. The document includes many photos of obviously broken—even mangled—handcarts, ramps and other equipment. <PARAGRAPH> The Eastvale warehouse does not actually store goods on site, but rather receives them by truck from the ports of L.A. and Los Angeles and redistributes them for shipping to Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. About 60 workers are on duty at a time at the 24-hour facility, with most of them loading and unloading boxes and some driving forklifts and tractors, the complaint notes. Like most warehouses, it involves a complicated ownership and staffing structure. Industry critics note that such structures allow major companies like Walmart to avoid responsibility for the working conditions and pay rates in their warehouses, and facilitate a heavy reliance on temporary staffing without job stability or benefits. <PARAGRAPH> The complaint is on behalf of 17 specific workers, 16 of whom are referred to as “joint Employees” of Walmart Stores, Inc., National Distribution Centers of Delaware, and staffing companies SCI Companies Inc., Warestaff, LLC and Select Staffing. Offering a glimpse of the tangled structure, it says: <PARAGRAPH> Both Warestaff and NFI managers often tell floor workers to move faster and punish workers for not meeting their quotas. NFI appears to be responsible for the maintenance of the facility, industrial trucks and other equipment. The property itself is owned by Swift. Workers who report injuries are given workers’ compensation forms labeled with the name SCI Companies, a Professional Employer Association, a subsidiary of which, PEO Management Group of Lawrenceville, GA, is also named on workers’ paychecks. At the same time, a Walmart Manager has been witnessed talking to the managers and workers about the facility’s production. <PARAGRAPH> Last month WWU caught an employee of a high-powered public relations firm posing as a college student and a reporter to infiltrate the group. The company, Mercury Public Affairs, advertises itself as specializing in “Latino Communications.” <PARAGRAPH> “That was pretty outrageous but unfortunately it’s not surprising,” said Palma. “We know that Walmart plays dirty.”
Chicago Coal Gasification Plant: Good Jobs or Bad Gas? | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO—“Governor Quinn, these construction boots we’re wearing are made for working. Governor Quinn, we put these boots to work to get you elected. Governor Quinn, put these construction boots to work and sign this bill.” <PARAGRAPH> So said Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters business representative Daniel McMahon, standing outside the State of Illinois building on July 9, wearing a hard hat and surrounded by burly union members brandishing signs reading “We Need Jobs and Investment.” <PARAGRAPH> McMahon and local elected officials were calling on the Illinois governor to sign SB 3766, a bill that will allow the company Leucadia National Corporation to recover 100 percent of construction costs for a coal gasification plant it wants to build on the city’s southeast side. (As things currently stand, it can recover 84 percent of construction costs by charging customers with Nicor Gas and Ameren for the synthetic natural gas the plant will produce.) The company says the plant will not be built without the bill's passage. Critics argue that the plant is a bad deal for ratepayers, who will be committed to purchase the gas for 30 years at rates which could end up significantly above market rates. <PARAGRAPH> The plant is projected to create 1,000 temporary construction jobs, 200 permanent jobs and 600 to 700 indirect jobs in Chicago, plus about 200 coal mining-related jobs downstate. Under legislation signed last summer, the plant would use at least 50 percent Illinois coal and up to 50 percent petroleum coke from oil refineries, turning it into gas that can be used instead of natural gas for residential and industrial customers. <PARAGRAPH> “This bill not only benefits the city of Chicago, it benefits downstate,” said State Sen. Donne E. Trotter, referring to the state's mining industry. “We’re using our natural resources.” <PARAGRAPH> McMahon and Millwrights business rep John Dunne said the jobs created in Chicago would almost surely be union and would be an economic salvation for the struggling southeast side. He said the unions would make sure local residents were trained in the kind of skills needed for the jobs. <PARAGRAPH> Hoyt Hudson, a representative for the Chicago Clean Energy project (as the plant is known), said that if the bill is passed, jobs will be created next year to carry out the $25-30 million brownfield remediation the company has promised to do on the site, a former coke plant. Actual construction of the gasification plant still depends on many uncertain factors including permitting, financing and the construction of a pipeline to carry carbon dioxide to the Gulf Coast. <PARAGRAPH> McMahon accused opponents of the plant of being “special interest groups” from outside the community. But on July 10, scores of local residents turned out to urge Quinn to veto the bill, presenting 11,250 petitions to that effect. They say the gasification plant offers the wrong kind of jobs for an area that is already heavily polluted from decades of heavy industry, much of it now closed up. Even though the plant’s emissions of toxic pollutants would be low, critics note that residents and workers would be exposed to harmful diesel emissions from trucks and machinery and dust from the transportation and storage of coal and petroleum coke. <PARAGRAPH> Environmentalists also oppose the creation of coal mining jobs, pointing to reports like the recent investigation by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity blaming unethical coal companies and lax government oversight for continued high rates of black lung disease. (The United Mineworkers of America, by contrast, is pushing for development of more so-called “clean coal” projects like the gasification plant.) <PARAGRAPH> “We want jobs, but we want jobs that won’t kill us,” said Robert Garcia, 35, a student who lives on the southeast side and is looking for work. “If more polluting industries come in, it will be harder to attract the kind of clean jobs we want.” <PARAGRAPH> “This is the wrong kind of investment,” added Rev. Zaki L. Zaki, superintendent of the Northwest District of the United Methodist Church. “We need to be intentional about creating a green energy hub. The south side of Chicago presents itself as the perfect place. There are a whole range of green technologies we could see here, research centers, actual energy generation, solar and wind production. If anyone can dream big, it’s we as Chicagoans.”
Rio Tinto Smelter Workers, United Steelworkers Reach a Deal | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> On July 5, the United Steelworkers ratified an agreement ending the six-month-plus lockout of about 780 union workers at Rio Tinto’s Alma smelter in Quebec, a struggle that gained widespread international solidarity and became emblematic of labor struggles in the modern metals industry. Though details of the settlement have still not been made public, on its website the union called it “a great victory for the workers and their supporters around the world.” <PARAGRAPH> USW President Leo Gerard was quoted saying: <PARAGRAPH> We were forced to take on the third-largest mining company in the world and we won… Many thought this was impossible, given the power imbalance, but we sent a message to the resource industry throughout the world that workers and their unions can take on huge multinational corporations to stop unjust demands. <PARAGRAPH> The stand-off started last fall around issues including the company’s intention to replace retiring union workers with non-union contractors. According to the USW website, this was addressed in the settlement, which applies through 2015: "The new contract rejects Rio Tinto’s demand. Contracting out will be strictly managed and limited for the collective agreement’s duration." <PARAGRAPH> Since the lockout, the plant has been operating at about two-thirds capacity, but that reportedly has not been a major blow to Rio Tinto—which acquired the smelter as part of its acquisition of Alcan in 2007—since the economic crisis has driven down demand for metals. The agreement apparently comes just in time for the company, as demand may now be picking up again, despite the Eurozone crisis. <PARAGRAPH> The smelter lockout had been a centerpiece of an "Off the Podium" campaign, which argues that by supplying metal for 4,700 medals from its Utah and Mongolia mines, Rio Tinto is sullying the ideals of the Olympic Games beginning soon in London. Reportedly more than 13,000 people signed a petition demanding Rio Tinto not be part of the Games. <PARAGRAPH> USW Quebec director Guy Farrell was previously quoted as saying: <PARAGRAPH> Locking out its workers in Quebec is a violation of Rio Tinto's obligations to fair play under the Olympic Charter. The effort by this company to drive down living wages at one of the most profitable aluminum smelters in the world is a dangerous precedent for workers and families everywhere. Rio Tinto is not Olympic calibre in its behaviour towards its own workers and their families. The company demands unrealistic concessions from employees, and locks them out when they don't concede. It pollutes the air and water in communities around the world. It has no place alongside the world's greatest athletes – it's time to get Rio Tinto off the Olympic podium. <PARAGRAPH> Activists have also opposed the Games' sponsorship by BP and Dow Chemicals, part of the Greenwash Gold campaign launched by a former sustainability director for the Games, Meredith Alexander. The group’s website quotes Alexander saying: <PARAGRAPH> The Olympics are meant to be about so much more than how fast Usain Bolt can run or how many medals Britain's finest athletes score. The modern Olympics was founded here in the UK to promote peace and understanding between the peoples of the world. The Olympic values are all about celebrating our common humanity. <PARAGRAPH> Even with the settlement, the union expects more acrimonious disputes with the company. On the USW website, USW Canadian national director Ken Neumann says: <PARAGRAPH> The USW will continue working with unions around the world to demand that Rio Tinto respect workers' and human rights and the environment…We know there will be new attacks by Rio Tinto on trade unions and communities. The Steelworkers will be there to help them resist Rio Tinto's assaults.
Our Kind of (Torturing) Town Journalist John Conroy’s first play chronicles a police brutality scandal in Chicago. | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Dan Breen seems to undergo a diabolical transformation as he speaks from the podium. The wise-cracking garrulous police officer who collects old coats for the homeless takes on a chilling fascistic visage as his speech crescendos: “God bless Jack, God bless you and God bless the city of Chicago!” <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile Otha Jeffries undergoes a transformation of his own before our eyes, from a sensitive if rebellious boy to a man pulsing with violence and rage, handcuffed but ready to burst “like a bomb” in his mother’s words, kicking over chairs and foaming at the mouth with impotent anger. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries and Breen are characters in My Kind of Town, a riveting play by veteran Chicago journalist John Conroy depicting the police torture scandal that he spent two decades chronicling. It plays through July 29 at the TimeLine Theatre in Chicago. <PARAGRAPH> Conroy’s stories for The Chicago Reader, including 1990’s “House of Screams,” told horrifying tales of African American men subjected to suffocation, electric shock and other certifiable torture meant to induce confessions under the watch of Vietnam veteran Jon Burge. Conroy’s dogged reporting helped bring to light the systematic and racist injustice that people at all levels of power, including then-state’s attorney and former Mayor Richard M. Daley, seemed determined to ignore. <PARAGRAPH> But as the scandal might otherwise be fading from public consciousness a year after Burge was sentenced to federal prison (on counts of obstruction of justice and perjury), the play confronts viewers in a way more visceral and raw than is possible in newsprint. It lays bare the multiple layers of pain, suffering, terror and despair meted out to men and their families by the coldly calculated methods of obtaining near-100 percent “clearance rates” in homicides at the Area Two police district. <PARAGRAPH> Breen (not a real name) is a Chicago cop under the Burge-like figure Jack Gunther, who never actually appears on stage. As played by David Parkes, Breen is a rich character with a trademark Chicago accent who exemplifies the line toed by Burge and his supporters: that police in the city’s toughest districts were dedicated servants doing what it took to protect African-American communities from bloodthirsty gangsters and thugs. Breen’s aforementioned speech is at a fundraiser for Gunther, who, like Burge did in real life, flees to Florida after the department has finally fired him. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries is a composite of a number of real men who were allegedly tortured by Burge or his underlings, some of them later released from prison after their convictions were deemed wrongful. <PARAGRAPH> Conroy came to write the play “almost by accident,” after a local producer suggested the scandal would be perfect for the stage. “I didn’t want anybody else to do it so I said yes,” he says. Though he had decades of reporting under his belt, including books about 1980s Belfast and about the police torture, Conroy had never written a play. <PARAGRAPH> “I didn’t know what I was doing, that’s why it has nine characters,” he says, noting the original draft had 13. “But I didn’t want to write a two- or three-character play. I really wanted to indict the city, and I couldn’t do that with two or three characters.” <PARAGRAPH> The play does indeed indict Chicago—the culture of political corruption, racism, segregation and cronyism which allowed the House of Screams to flourish—while at the same time it manages to celebrate the city with spot-on references to north side-south side rivalries and video clips of historic events like the 1967 Big Snow that briefly bridged racial divides. <PARAGRAPH> The sin of looking the other way is embodied in the fictionalized composite state’s attorney Maureen Buckley, who is demoted to the city hall basement after asking too many questions but nevertheless stands up for her “tribe” when it comes to the witness box. Conroy plumbs the complicated social dynamics that can arise when families are torn apart by violence, poverty and incarceration. He paints Jeffries’ parents as disturbingly but understandably ambivalent about their son’s release from prison, given his mental breakdown—“something snapped,” his mother says—and the danger he likely poses and faces if he is released. <PARAGRAPH> “I speculated that was something I might feel if my son had gone crazy, he might be homicidal or suicidal,” Conroy says. “It was actually something that came from Northern Ireland, where I met mothers who said, ‘I’m glad my son is inside because at least he won’t get killed there.’” <PARAGRAPH> Conroy says writing a play was much different from journalism, and he had to struggle to “divorce himself” from strictly portraying the facts. “I had it in my mind the script should be faithful to certain things and one of those was the years,” he notes, but director Nick Bowling eventually convinced him of the importance of condensing a complicated chronology down to two discrete time periods. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries (played with stunning intensity by Charles Gardner) throws viewers for a loop at the end of the play—SPOILER ALERT!—with a cryptic comment indicating he may be guilty after all. Conroy says this twist was Bowling’s idea to add more drama, and he initially balked. “I felt like he’d kicked me in the gut, and Nick said that’s exactly the response we want from the audience. It boils down to the question of is it right to torture anybody regardless of what they’ve done?” <PARAGRAPH> With Burge in prison, most of the officers and prosecutors linked to the scandal (including Daley) retired or deceased and a number of tortured men released from prison, the torture scandal could be fading into the past. But Conroy is adamant that should not happen, and he hopes his play will help keep alive this history and an ongoing struggle for justice. <PARAGRAPH> “There are still a dozen guys in prison on the basis of suspect confessions,” he says. “All they’re asking for is a new hearing, but they’re having to fight this battle on their own. Everyone now knows this torture took place at Area Two, so what does it cost society to examine this small group of cases? Not much! It needs to be done. It’s immoral not to give them a new hearing.” <PARAGRAPH> He adds that people tortured at Area Two who have finished their sentences still cannot seek compensation, since the statute of limitations on filing a civil suit expired long before the evidence of systematic torture came to light. And Conroy notes that the code of silence is still alive and well in the department, as evidenced by the city’s refusal in recent years to release the names of officers with multiple misconduct complaints. A majority of city councilors have demanded such records to help root out “bad apples” and relieve taxpayers who are subsidizing millions of dollars in legal settlements against these officers, but the city has resisted. <PARAGRAPH> “Burge did not act alone,” Conroy said. “It’s good there’s been some public recognition in terms of one guy going to prison. But what about the other 30? The system has not changed.” <PARAGRAPH> Conroy never meant to become so focused on a single, ongoing investigation, he says, and he sometimes regrets that he became so publicly associated with that story to the exclusion of his other journalistic interests. But knowing that people’s lives were literally on the line, he couldn’t back off. After the tumultuous changes in the journalism industry Conroy is no longer working as a staff journalist, and it is unlikely today that any Chicago reporter would be paid to cover an investigative story to the dogged extent Conroy did. It makes you wonder what injustices may be occurring now without journalistic scrutiny. For his part, Conroy is focusing  less on the foreclosed possibilities of journalism, and more on liberating potential of theater. <PARAGRAPH> “You can do something in theater that you can’t really do in journalism, which is point the finger at the broader society,” he said. “How everybody looked the other way and no one cared.”
Shafted: Reflecting on Miners, Media and Margaret Thatcher | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Many coal-fired power plants in the United States are closing because of cheap natural gas prices, and while the closings are cheered for environmental and health reasons,  some unions lament the loss of jobs. Many who are happy to see coal plants close are also frustrated that the change is driven by a rush for gas that could curb investment in clean wind power and the "green jobs" mass wind farm construction could create. Others mourn waning interest in the development of "clean coal" technology that arguably could let the United States tap its vast domestic coal reserves more responsibly. <PARAGRAPH> Three decades ago, Great Britain had its own "Dash for Gas," during which coal power plants and coal mines were closed as the country turned to natural gas to generate electricity. But the primary motive then was neither cheap and abundant natural gas nor environmental concern. Rather, it was then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's determined campaign to smash the powerful National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the labor movement in general, and to privatize public industries. <PARAGRAPH> Given current conversations about our energy futures in the United States and worldwide —not to mention scandals in British media and U.S. battles over public union rights—I think it is worth revisiting the 2009 book, Shafted: The Media, The Miners Strike and the Aftermath. <PARAGRAPH> Edited by Granville Williams, this compilation explores the role of spin, solidarity and strategy in the bitter 1984-1985 strike by miners and sympathetic union members as the Thatcher government and police acting on its behalf moved to gut the miners union and close many coal mines. Chapters written by prominent journalists and others detail the seedy ethics of many mainstream media outlets; the role of alternative media; early examples of community and "citizen journalism;" and the power of propaganda and popular organizing wielded by various parties to the conflict. <PARAGRAPH> There are juicy and shameful examples of media outlets' questionable ethics and bald partisanship, juxtaposed with the solidarity stands of union journalists and printers who refused to publish slanderous propaganda or who invoked equal-time policies to demand the miners be given a chance to tell their side. <PARAGRAPH> The book notes The Sun's plans to publish a photo of union leader Arthur Scargill cropped to make it appear he was doing a Nazi salute, The Daily Mirror's claims that union leaders paid their mortgages with Libyan cash when they didn't even have mortgages, and the BBC's manipulation of camera footage to make it appear miners rather than police were the first to become violent in the seminal clash at Orgreaves. <PARAGRAPH> Regarding the Libyan story, which was supplied by a union staffer who approached the tabloid, author Robin Ramsay notes wryly, "Ah, the logic of the tabloid journalist: he didn't ask for money, so he must be telling the truth." <PARAGRAPH> Shafted, published with a grant from the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom, criticizes journalistic laziness and the lack of context that plagued even the less-abhorrent coverage. For example, the Tory government's statements about the "uneconomic" nature of certain union mines and the wisdom of burning up limited North Sea gas reserves in lieu of coal went unquestioned, according to Shafted, and the conflict was too often portrayed as a battle between colorful adversaries (namely Thatcher and Scargill) than a showdown that would determine the well-being of working people for many years to come. <PARAGRAPH> As a counter to most of the mainstream media's performance, Shafted celebrates the role of the grassroots alternative media, the NUM's own journal, and documentaries and articles by miners and community members, produced with the help of grassroots media organizations and the public Channel 4. <PARAGRAPH> The book notes that journalists at alternative outlets with names like Leeds Other Paper, Islington Gutter Press and Sheep Worrying could personally relate to the DIY mentality and sense of mission and passion of the union miners and their supporters. Along with print media, the book also examines music, poetry and major movies like Billy Elliott and The Full Monty. It catalogues the use of music to raise funds and awareness, from local punk shows to benefits by the likes of Chumbawumba and Billy Bragg. <PARAGRAPH> One chapter about movies and plays in decades after the strike describes how popular pieces like Billy Elliott furthered the Thatcherite idea of individualism triumphing over collectivism, and the glossing over of the impacts on depressed "pit villages" where to paraphrase sources, now heroin instead of coal runs in the veins of youth. <PARAGRAPH> Perhaps the most insightful chapter is a soul-searching essay by former BBC journalist Nicholas Jones, who looks back with dismay at how he and other journalists unquestioningly bought into the Thatcher narrative of militant trade unions as the "enemy within." He takes a more nuanced view than other contributors of mainstream media's performance, and notes that union leader Scargill's portrayal of the media as the enemy was counter-productive since it meant journalists were often received with scorn or violence in pit villages, and thus understandably less likely to tell the people's stories. (Other chapters also describe how police brutally attacked and arrested journalists trying to report objectively on the conflict.) <PARAGRAPH> Jones also describes how the birth of the 24-hour highly competitive news cycle contributed to flawed coverage of the strike, and dissects why media coverage of mass protests against more pit closures in the early 1990s was by contrast highly sympathetic to the miners. Jones writes: <PARAGRAPH> With the benefit of hindsight, and subsequent evidence of a vindictive pit closure programme which continued during the decade which followed the strike, perhaps the news media should own up to a collective failure of judgment comparative to that during the buildup to the Iraq war.
Chicago Teachers Union Takes the Upper Hand with Overwhelming Strike Vote | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The Chicago Teachers Union lost an important skirmish with Mayor Rahm Emanuel last year when the state legislature passed Emanuel-backed legislation requiring a 75 percent vote to authorize a strike – a high number seen as a blow for teachers unions in Illinois. <PARAGRAPH> But the attack apparently helped energize and mobilize the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), as a whopping 89 percent of teachers voted on June 11 to authorize a strike come fall (actually late summer) as highly contentious contract negotiations stretch on. Chicago teachers last went on strike in 1987. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel acknowledged the overwhelming vote but tried to minimize its significance by asking the public and media to focus on other numbers – the increased hours he wants kids in school. Teachers have repeatedly said they are not against a longer school day or school year, but demand appropriate pay raises in return. Emanuel rescinded a contractually obligated 4 percent raise for teachers during his first year in office, and now his administration is proposing a contract with a 2 percent raise while lengthening the work day from seven hours to seven hours and 40 minutes. <PARAGRAPH> Many parents have pushed for a compromise, with more time in school but not as much as Emanuel and Chicago Public Schools CEO Jean-Claude Brizard are demanding. Critics of the longer day cite oppressive heat in many non-air conditioned buildings, other demands on students’ time and the inescapable fact that Chicago schools’ problems go much deeper than the number of hours in class. <PARAGRAPH> At five hours and 45 minutes, Chicago students have one of the nation’s shortest days. But teachers say the actual amount of instruction in Chicago schools is on par with other schools nationwide. There is no easy fix for the systematic economic and social problems that impact Chicago students, but more resources and smaller class sizes would likely do more than extended days to improve student engagement and performance. <PARAGRAPH> The union says the administration’s contract proposal will result in larger class sizes. Jackson Potter blogged on the union website: <PARAGRAPH> Like Republican candidate Mitt Romney, they make the argument that class size doesn’t matter…The Board has reserved the right to change class size policy at any time and merely notify the union and it has eliminated any funding of positions to lower class size in the district; the previous contract committed $2.25 million to lower class sizes. These changes will concretely increase our class sizes throughout the district, even though many kindergarten and primary grade classrooms throughout the city have class sizes that approach 50 students in a room. <PARAGRAPH> The union blasts the administration’s proposal for increasing the focus on standardized test-based student performance in evaluating teachers, including an emphasis on “merit pay.” Nationwide, teachers have long complained that evaluating their performance based heavily on standardized testing is unfair to dedicated teachers in under-funded, low-income and immigrant-heavy schools and curbs their ability to teach creatively. <PARAGRAPH> Potter summarizes other reasons the union opposes the administration’s proposal: eliminating teachers’ ability to bank sick days, increasing health insurance costs and requiring teachers to work 10-hour-days during report card pickup. <PARAGRAPH> In the wake of the strike vote Emanuel also touted the fact that 60.6 percent of Chicago Public Schools students who were freshmen four years ago graduated this year – the highest rate since at least 1999. But the insinuation that this improvement is because of measures pushed by his administration comes off as disingenuous when one considers that these measures have only been rolled out in recent months and not in all schools. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel said the strike vote does not affect ongoing contract negotiations with the teachers union, but the union has noted that taking the vote several months before they might strike was meant to provide leverage in the negotiations and allow 1,500 retiring teachers to vote. With more than 25,000 unionized teachers, CPS is the third-largest school district in the country and the CTU is the largest member of the American Federation of Teachers. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel has portrayed teachers as putting their interests before students’ well-being, and professed his dedication to Chicago students – framing his battle with the teachers as a fight for opportunity and equality for low-income students. But many parents and students have spoken out in support of teachers, who often already put in many unpaid hours and often spent money out of their own pockets to buy supplies. <PARAGRAPH> There has been much intrigue around efforts to generate community support (or the appearance of it) for the Emanuel administration’s reform policies, including revelations last year that politically connected ministers had paid church members to show up at community meetings in support of administration proposals to close so-called failing schools. Around the strike vote, many parents received robocalls attacking the teachers' decision to hold an early strike vote. The calls and other efforts against the teachers have been linked to national astroturf "education reform" groups also active in California and other states where public sector unions have squared off with city and state officials. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, it turns out that Obama strategist David Axelrod’s former public relations firm AKPD Media and Messaging is behind ads attacking the teachers union. Long-time progressive school reformer and small schools advocate Mike Klonsky noted in a blog post about this revelation that Emanuel “seems hell-bent on destroying the city's public employee unions.” Klonsky also questioned the motivations of American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten sharing the podium with Emanuel in support of his massive new infrastructure plan – with a heavy focus on privatization – just weeks after she marched with Chicago teachers calling for a strike vote. (The infrastructure plan’s marketing is spearheaded by another of Axelrod’s former outfits, ASGK Public Strategies.) <PARAGRAPH> Chicago Sun-Times columnist – and former teacher – Carol Marin noted: <PARAGRAPH> Teachers in this town have been demonized, demoralized, and disrespected. No profession is beyond criticism and no public school system is without significant problems. But taking a sledgehammer approach to CPS teachers and their union has backfired on the Emanuel administration and his schools CEO, Jean-Claude Brizard. And all the radio ads and robo calls funded by out of town, union-busting billionaires doesn’t alter that fact. <PARAGRAPH> While longer days and closing schools are the prominent issues in Emanuel’s battle with union teachers, the conflict has much deeper significance in terms of ongoing battles for the future of public employees unions. And while Emanuel and others who figure into the administration’s plans are considered far to the left of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the battle promises to continue nearly as polarized and hard-fought. Stay tuned.
Unhappy Father’s Day! Paid Paternity Leave Far From Reality in United States | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Many of the young fathers who celebrated Father's Day on Sunday are more interested than ever in taking an active care-giving and social role in their children's lives, according to studies cited in a new report by the National Partnership for Women and Families. But especially in the tight economy, relatively few fathers have access to paid family leave after the birth of a child or when a child is sick, and too few fathers even have unpaid job-protected leave to deal with family emergencies and responsibilities.  <PARAGRAPH>  The Partnership's report, "Dads Expect Better: Top States for New Dads," evaluates state laws beyond the federal requirements of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) implemented in 1993, which guarantees a certain amount of unpaid leave for employees with more than 1,250 hours of service at workplaces with at least 50 employees. In May, the Partnership released "Expecting Better: A State-by-State Analysis of Laws that Help New Parents."  <PARAGRAPH>  The report on fathers paints a dire picture of the paltry paid and unpaid leave afforded parents. It also makes the case that more family leave for fathers helps women and children and even society as a whole, citing studies that show when fathers (and mothers) get better leave, families are less likely to need public assistance.   <PARAGRAPH>  It notes that fathers are better able to share household and caregiving duties with women when they have more leave and job protection, which can lessen the work and earning inequities between men and women and help children have closer relationships with their fathers and better role models for gender equity. The report cites longitudinal evidence that fathers who could take paid leave immediately after a child's birth remained more involved in their lives down the line.   <PARAGRAPH>  Family leave is of course also especially important to single working fathers, who like single mothers can often be in the painful and terrifying position of losing a badly needed job or wages when a child is sick. The report found fathers report more conflict between their work and family life than before, in fact at higher rates than women report conflict, perhaps because of men's increasing desire to be involved with their children.  <PARAGRAPH>  The report notes that only the District of Columbia and Connecticut guarantee workers the right to earn paid sick days. It says the United States ranks among the middle of 21 highly competitive countries in the amount of leave granted to new fathers, with 12 unpaid weeks mandated under the FMLA.  <PARAGRAPH>  However, on average, men take only 10.4 weeks of unpaid leave, and many cannot afford unpaid leave at all. Even the best employers typically don't offer more than three weeks of paid paternity leave, with the amount declining since 2005. That compares to 31 countries that guarantee or offer 14 weeks or more of paid paternity leave.  <PARAGRAPH>  After California implemented the nation's first paternity leave insurance program in 2005, the amount of leave fathers took almost tripled from three to eight weeks, and the likelihood they would take leave at all more than doubled to three-quarters. Ratings for the social acceptability of taking paternity leave also climbed. Along with California, New Jersey also has a family leave insurance program covering mothers and fathers. Studies show a significant majority of Americans support expanded paternity and maternity and family leave rights.  <PARAGRAPH>  The report ranks the District of Columbia and the 14 states that do offer guaranteed family-leave rights for fathers on factors including the amount of paid and unpaid job-protected leave, whether leave laws cover small businesses or newer employees not covered under the FMLA  and whether fathers can take leave to care for a same-sex or domestic partner's child. The District of Columbia ranked first, followed by Connecticut and New Jersey in second place, then California. Maine, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Tennessee, Maryland and Minnesota also joined the list.  <PARAGRAPH>  "Despite the imperative -- for workers and families, for businesses and for communities -- to adapt our nation's policies to the realities of the  21st century workforce, progress is painfully slow," the report notes. "The arrival of a child should be cause for celebration. For millions of parents throughout the United States, however, a child's birth or adoption means stretched finances and unsettling concerns about whether caring for their child will cost them their jobs and jeopardize their families' financial security."
Black Days for the Irish Economy | <PARAGRAPH> TULLYCROSS, IRELAND—Ten days after Irish citizens voted to ratify the proposed European Union fiscal austerity treaty, the sense of resignation about the gloomy economic situation seems heightened, especially in light of recent news that the vote will not mean an imminent re-entry to bond markets. Meanwhile, some expect Spain's bailout will make Ireland's prospects even worse. <PARAGRAPH> In a May 31 referendum, voters approved the treaty 60 to 40 percent, with voter turnout at about 50 percent. For the treaty to take effect, 12 Eurozone ccountries need to ratify it—a condition still in doubt given opposition in Greece, France and other countries. <PARAGRAPH> The treaty says a country's deficit cannot exceed 0.5 percent of its GDP; in 2011, Ireland's deficit equaled 9.4 percent of its GDP. Still Ireland has been considered the "poster child" or "good boy" for compliance with austerity measures previously mandated in order to receive bailouts—measures that treaty opponents blame for Ireland's 14 percent unemployment rate and ongoing economic stress. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Opponents—most notably the nationalist party Sinn Fein—had accused proponents of using fear to push for a yes vote, and they said that, contrary to treaty proponents' rhetoric, loans and bailout funds would still be available had voters refused the treaty. <PARAGRAPH> Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the treaty and Ireland's participation are key to European economic recovery and stability. But the days after the vote did little to bolster citizens' confidence and were described as an embarrassment for Kenny after his promises that a yes vote would ease woes. Credit agencies, including Fitch, announced that, despite the vote, Ireland's credit rating would not be upgraded and its ability to re-enter the bond markets remains unclear. <PARAGRAPH> Some had hoped that the yes vote would lead to a deal that would reduce Irish bank debt that taxpayers are mandated to repay, but Merkel and the European Central Bank denied that possibility. <PARAGRAPH> "This lady Merkel is just crazy about money," the owner of a pub, store and inn on a rural road in County Mayo told me, noting his business has suffered greatly since the economy crashed. He thinks Ireland's compliance with austerity measures from the 2008 Lisbon Treaty did nothing to help, in the face of crippling bank debt. "They should just wipe the slate clean and start all over again, let us have a boom for another 20 years." <PARAGRAPH> A number of people I talked with described the crippling levels of debt that most residents live with, even as the country appears relatively prosperous. <PARAGRAPH> "It's a facade, like a movie set," said the owner of a bed and breakfast in the town of Westport. "People started building two and three houses, and now they can't pay for them ... so many were put up so fast they are terrible quality." <PARAGRAPH> Indeed, there are many spacious, upscale large houses standing empty or unfinished throughout the lovely countryside, though it appears they are largely never-lived-in second homes or upgraded homes not carrying the specter of painful foreclosures and families thrown out on the street. <PARAGRAPH> It seems unclear to everyone exactly what the economic future holds, but residents do not feel optimistic and think they will get a raw deal under the fiscal treaty. On the social media politics site, Political World, one participant wrote: <PARAGRAPH> "If the Irish government could grow some balls in the very short week ahead, and close ranks with others in the same boat, they might learn a trick or two and possibly even get somewhere. [T]hey should know by now that trying to be teacher's pet isn't working. [T]hey're not even getting a pat on the head anymore." <PARAGRAPH> Leaders on both sides of the treaty debate have invoked the importance of the free market, with treaty proponents saying a no vote would kill private investment and opponents saying private investment—in pharmaceutical manufacturing, information technology and the like—would continue even if Ireland refused the treaty. But there was bad news on the jobs front in the days after the vote. <PARAGRAPH> Pfizer  announced it would cut 177 jobs at two plants in County Cork, and the major public-private bus company Bus Éireann revealed plans to slash allowances, sick days, and holidays for 2,500 workers in an attempt to reduce payroll costs by €9 million annually and save €20 million annually. <PARAGRAPH> Another large bus company, Dublin Bus, announced similar cuts, and Irish Rail announced 450 voluntary redundancies. Bus Éireann said fuel costs and the loss of €6 million in state subsidies necessitated the cuts. The National Bus and Rail Union promised a standoff, saying the union would not accept the cuts. <PARAGRAPH> As for Pfizer, the Irish Independent quoted SIPTU union shop steward Gerry Sharma  saying: "The mood is very somber at the moment. Pfizer is a very good company to work for and these kinds of jobs won't come around again. There are a lot of people being made redundant who would have big mortgages and the jobs market is very bleak at the moment. It's just another black day in the Irish economy."
Ireland Amidst Turf Wars, Literally | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> COUNTY MAYO, IRELAND — On the fog-enshrouded, windswept Atlantic coast of Ireland in County Mayo, the treeless bluffs where sheep ramble are dotted with odd pyramids of bricks of rich black sod arranged in neat rows. This is the "turf," or strips of peat from ancient bogs, that for centuries rural residents have dried and burned to heat their homes. <PARAGRAPH> This is turf-cutting season, and turf has taken on special political and social significance related to everything from Ireland's battle for independence a century ago to the recent vote on the proposed EU austerity treaty. <PARAGRAPH> Under pressure from the European Union, Ireland banned cutting turf in certain "raised bogs" that are protected areas for environmental and historical reasons. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, reducing the burning of turf, considered a fossil fuel, is also central to Ireland's efforts to reduce carbon emissions as part of the EU's combined commitment under the Kyoto Protocol. Ireland has committed to reducing its emissions 20 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and peat—created by the decomposition of vegetation over hundreds of years—is highly carbon intensive. <PARAGRAPH> But the 53 areas designated as protected bogs are on land where families have cut turf for centuries, and many see the limits as a violation of their rights and of Irish sovereignty, as well as an impingement on their economic well-being. A recent survey of 21 of the protected areas found that turf was being cut illegally in 17 of them. <PARAGRAPH> Turf-cutting has become symbolic of the escalating resentment of the goverment among rural dwellers, and of divisions between rural and urban residents. Rural residents are also incensed about new taxes for septic tank inspections and other measures that they say threaten their traditional ways of life. Defending turf-cutting is part of the Standing Up for Rural Ireland campaign that nationalist party Sinn Fein invoked to rally opposition to the EU austerity treaty, which a majority of voters approved in the May 31 referendum. Treaty vote results aside, these stances helped Sinn Fein's popularity climb significantly in the past year. <PARAGRAPH> The Irish government has offered compensation to farmers for ceasing to cut peat on their family lands or offered them access to alternative unprotected bogs. But many have apparently found this solution unsatisfactory, doubting they will be adequately compensated and saying that they harvest turf in sustainable amounts developed over centures. Environmentalists counter that mechanized turf-cutting has changed things in recent years, and created large-scale commercial enterprises out of what used to be sustainable family activities. Turf-cutters oppose moves to demand commercial licenses for turf-selling among rural neighbors, and say turf is merely sold door to door by youths for pocket money. <PARAGRAPH> According to its website, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association fights to "defend the right of the Irish people to cut their own turf, for their own use, on their own turf banks, as our people have done for over 500 years and still our raised bogs remain some of the best protected in all of Europe." <PARAGRAPH> The association proposed a reform plan of its own, which the government did not adopt, leading the association in March to call for its members to break off contact with the government and to vote no in the May 31 referendum on the austerity treaty with the turf-cutting limits in mind as "evidence of the anti-Democratic and dictatorial nature of the EU." <PARAGRAPH> The integration of turf in the rural household and farming economies is evident when traveling through the country. Many roadside stands or gas stations sell turf as a home fuel, along with coal (much of it from Poland) and gas. In cozy pubs, many a fireplace is full of rich peat waiting to be burned. The air is often ripe with the acrid, loamy smell of burning peat. And in the bogs along the western coast, the land is furrowed  and carved in surreal shapes from turf-cutting. <PARAGRAPH> Over the Easter week in April, farmers cut turf in protected areas in a movement they referred to as a strike and commemorative of the Easter Uprising of 1916, when the Irish fought for independence from British rule. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, many government officials and urbanites say the turf-cutting limits and new taxes are only fair and necessary given current economic and environmental realities. <PARAGRAPH> A recent op ed by Dublin Institute of Technology economics lecturer Sean Byrne in the Irish Times said rural farmers should be held accountable for the extra infrastructure costs they create that are picked up by all taxpayers, and said it is a deluded notion that rural living is somehow more ecologically-friendly than dense urban living. He critiqued farmers for resisting environmental protections even as, he wrote, much of their income is ensured by EU farm policies. <PARAGRAPH> While government leaders say much progress has been made in reaching a compromise over the decade or so that turf-cutting has been controversial, the protests of turf-cutters during a meeting with EU officials in March shows the deeper issues involved are not going away any time soon. Protesters held signs saying "Sod Off EU" and told reporters that they don't need "men in suits" in Brussels or Dublin telling them what to do.
Austerity Debate in Ireland Heats Up as EU Treaty Vote Nears | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CORK, DUBLIN AND BELFAST—In such a lush, green, rainsoaked country, the huge color poster of cracked dry earth on a bridge in Dublin looks incongruous. But to opponents of the European Union fiscal treaty that Irish citizens are voting on May 31, it represents a bleak future committed to austerity policies limiting the size of the country's deficit and debt. Next to the cracked earth is an image of lush tropical plants, representing the "growth" the poster says is possible if citizens turn down the treaty and don't curb government spending on social services and public jobs. <PARAGRAPH> The week before the vote, the bustling streets of Dublin, Cork and other cities are plastered with posters both for and against the treaty, with polls saying the treaty is expected to gain majority approval though support for a "no" vote is growing, as is approval for the nationalist party Sinn Fein, which is leading opposition to it. <PARAGRAPH> Trade unions and other groups have recently demonstrated in Brussels, Madrid and The Hague in support of Irish citizens opposed to the treaty, and as of this writing, a demonstration is planned in Copenhagen the week of the vote. <PARAGRAPH> In Dublin and Cork, ads produced by opponents of the treaty appear much more prevalent and from a wider variety of sources than pro-treaty advertisements. Opponents frame the measure as an "austerity treaty" and include images of bread lines, a ball and chain, a large fish devouring a smaller one, a yellow sign warning "Danger: Permanent Austerity Ahead" and so on. The parties and groups producing anti-treaty materials include Sinn Fein, the Socialist Party, the United Left Alliance, the Workers Party and Libertas, whose posters say "Cut Bank Debt or No Deal." Fliers for meetings and demonstrations against the treaty are ubiquitous. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, posters supporting the measure call it a "stability treaty," promising it will increase investment and jobs, and feature images including a tattered Irish flag, presumably representing Ireland's future if it does not ratify. Treaty proponents threaten that Ireland will be "isolated" from the EU and unable to obtain future bailouts, loans or investment if voters reject the treaty. <PARAGRAPH> During a nationally televised address from Sinn Fein's annual party meeting in Killarney on May 26, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams called on voters to refuse the treaty, saying people "need to ask themselves if recent budget cuts led to jobs and growth...The answer is obvious. The answer is No — if you accept that, you should vote No.” <PARAGRAPH> Adams had called for Taoiseach Enda Kenny to debate him on the treaty. Kenny refused, but was given an amount of television time May 27 equal to the time Adams spent discussing the treaty to make his points. <PARAGRAPH> Instead of cutting government spending, Adams echoed the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' call for a stimulus program to create jobs—a 13-billion-Euro, three-year plan that Adams said would create 130,000 jobs. <PARAGRAPH> The Irish Times reported that Sinn Fein's popularity has climbed coinciding with its stance on the treaty, it now being the second most popular party in Ireland behind Fine Gael, and Adams being the most popular party leader. The Labour Party's support has dropped significantly since it has been supporting the treaty. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, Kenny reportedly also backed the idea of a stimulus package in EU talks over the weekend (in that case, a European stimulus package being promoted by new French president Francois Hollande). However, the Irish Independent reported that Kenny does not want a stimulus introduced into a renegotiated financial treaty, as some European leaders have proposed, in part because that would bolster opponents' claims that the treaty can be changed after the Irish vote. <PARAGRAPH> The Independent notes that Kenny is also skittish about a Financial Transaction Tax  being implemented in the Eurozone countries, as some have proposed, since such a measure (widely backed by progressives) would put the Irish financial industry at a comparative disadvantage if London's investment industry were not subject to the tax. <PARAGRAPH> In his televised speech, Adams also called for the reunification of Ireland with Northern Ireland—Sinn Fein's central platform—as a way to increase investment and create jobs, saying: <PARAGRAPH> A united Ireland makes sense, a single island economy makes sense...It does not make sense on an island this size and with a population of six million to have two states, two bureaucracies, two sets of government departments and two sets of agencies competing for inward investment. <PARAGRAPH> The Workers Party of Northern Ireland opposes the treaty. Though Northern Ireland citizens can't vote in the May 31 referendum, many unions and labor leaders see the struggles of those in Ireland and Northern Ireland as one and the same, as evidenced at the Belfast May Day parade several weeks ago. <PARAGRAPH> Irish members of Parliament have time off the week of the vote to canvas voters about the treaty, according to the Irish Independent, which humorously warned residents to "lock your doors" in anticipation of the visits. An anti-treaty Op Ed by David McWilliams in the Irish Independent said the treaty defies basic logic regarding the economic behavior of individuals versus economic systems, noting that it might be wise and valorous for any given individual to cut spending and save money, but if everyone does that at once, the economy freezes up. McWilliams wrote: <PARAGRAPH> The vast majority of employed Irish people are employed in the domestic sector. This means that we buy and sell stuff to one another. This implies a golden rule, that many business people fail to grasp: your spending is my income, and my spending is your income. <PARAGRAPH> Paul Krugman made a similar argument in The New York Times, writing that "spending cuts in a depressed economy just make the depression deeper."  Like treaty opponents, Krugman attacked Irish leaders' claims that Ireland's economy has been recovering since instituting a previous round of austerity measures. <PARAGRAPH> It seems the numbers do show Ireland is severely struggling economically. But in two weeks traveling around the country, I personally could not help but be struck by how prosperous Ireland appears compared to the U.S., where drastic cuts in public spending have also been hotly debated. In a wide variety of Irish cities, towns and rural areas, I saw few vacant buildings or signs of homelessness, extreme poverty or decaying infrastructure; by contrast, energetic and apparently effective public campaigns to eliminate litter and improve road safety were obvious everywhere. <PARAGRAPH> It was evident that many struggle to make a living in Belfast in Northern Ireland, where Protestant residents still throw bricks and bottles over the wall that separates Shankill from the Catholic neighborhoods. Paddy Campbell, who leads famous (and excellent) Black Cab tours about the Troubles, noted that Belfast is only now developing a tourist museum about the Titanic as well as other investments expected to create jobs that two decades ago would have been unthinkable given the violence and inequality. But even in the neighborhoods where Catholics have suffered extreme marginalization and repression for centuries, there were not the outward signs of economic desperation that one would find in New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago or countless other U.S. cities. <PARAGRAPH> These observations don't mean I doubt the seriousness of Ireland's economic crisis or the significance of the treaty decision. Rather the trip has driven home for me just how dire things have become in the U.S., which was once the place many thousands of immigrants from Ireland fled escaping famine, repression and poverty to pursue and often achieve the American Dream.
As Mines Develop in Michigan, a Reminder of Copper’s Complex Past | <PARAGRAPH> ALLIHIES, IRELAND—Last week, as I was catching up on U.S. news from Allihies, a small town perched on rugged cliffs on Ireland's west coast, I read reports from Michigan's Upper Peninsula of the latest developments in Rio Tinto's in-the-works copper and nickel mine. Many in the economically-struggling area hope the mine will bring badly needed jobs and investment. Others think new mining in the area will destroy the outdoor recreation and tourism that have been a major part of the economy since historic mines closed up decades ago. Among the opponents is the Huron Mountain Club, an exclusive group whose early members include East Coast and Midwest industrial titans, which recently filed a lawsuit attempting to block the mine. <PARAGRAPH> As in the Upper Peninsula, copper mining was once the lifeblood of Allihies. And when Allihies’ underground mines were tapped out and closed in the late 1800s, many of the Irish and Cornish miners left for mining jobs in the U.S., specifically in the Upper Peninsula and Butte, Mont., where they became famous for radical labor and anti-war activism. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The bravery and strength of Irish miners in Butte who went on strike opposing World War I, and U.S. support of the British, are not surprising, given the conditions they had labored under in the Irish mines. As I learned while visiting the excellent Allihies Copper Mine Museum, miners (including many children) toiled underground for 12-hour shifts and were paid no wages—only a sum for the actual copper extracted from the ore they hauled out (minus payments to the mine company for their equipment and supplies). The concentration of the copper in the ore was a matter of chance—it might bear none at all. <PARAGRAPH> Miners had a one-in-two chance of contracting deadly silicosis from breathing in the rock dust, and were also at great risk from explosions, gassing and other disasters. The museum includes logs listing those killed, including one worker who died from an infection following a fracture of the skull, and a 13-year-old who died from leg injuries after suffering for hours. It also notes that after the death of one worker in a mine, his widow received only a small pension for one year. <PARAGRAPH> The miners worked in teams, with light from candles stuck to their helmets with lumps of clay. One would hold a spike to the rock while others slammed it with massive hammers. During blasting, miners ran for their lives. "You hold your ears," notes text from the exhibit, "but some of you don't have to because you are already deaf." <PARAGRAPH> One display describes the innovation of the "man engine," a crude escalator that carried men up and down the deep shafts so that they weren't exhausted by the time they reached bottom—a dangerous, hour-long descent for which they received no pay. Wealthy mine owner John Puxley had calculated how much more he could profit if miners moved in and out more efficiently, noting that the man engine would also "keep the miners quiet." Puxley imported food for miners during the famine of 1845, but the exhibit notes that it was not for "purely humanitarian reasons," as he knew the mine would close if miners starved to death like so many Irish did during those years. <PARAGRAPH> Miners from Cornwall often served as managers in the Irish mines, and once the Irish mines closed, they, like the Irish workers, fled to Michigan, California and Montana in search of new jobs. Many of the people hoping that a resurgence of mining in the Great Lakes region will create more jobs are descendants of these Cornish and Irish immigrants, as evidenced not only by their surnames, but also by the doughy meat-and-vegetable pasties sold in roadside shops around the U.P.  An impressive multimedia presentation at the Allihies museum depicts the lively St. Patrick's Day parades and Irish dance festivals in Butte—where Joe Hill often sang for striking miners—and notes that today, fifth-generation Irish Americans in Butte, most of whom have never been to Ireland, celebrate a culture "frozen in time" when their predecessors emigrated. The exhibit also describes the labor history of Butte, including the U.S. Army’s occupation of the town from 1917 until 1921, when it "broke the back of the labor movement and secured the interests of the Anaconda copper company." <PARAGRAPH> Today, copper is mined in ore that has exponentially lower concentrations than in the 1800s, given modern mining, refining technology and high prices. During the 1950s, a Canadian company hired locals to explore mining again around Allihies but ultimately decided it wasn't worth it. Now, Allihies’ rich mining history is part of the town's appeal to tourists; in addition to the museum there is a heritage trail winding by old mine shafts, crumbling stone engine houses and reservoirs used to provide hydropower for the operations. There are dreams of opening the underground shafts for tours, or even holding concerts in one of the cavernous "stopes," where sunlight filtering in from the fractured rock creates an ethereal effect. <PARAGRAPH> The photos and descriptions of the horrifying labor conditions and payment arrangements in the Allihies mines reminds one just how much things have changed since those days, thanks largely to the efforts of union immigrant miners. When those Irish mines opened two centuries ago, no one could imagine the iPads, car batteries, skyscrapers and precision machinery that are now driving demand for copper and other metals. But people are still fighting to balance the economic incentives and harmful effects of mining, struggling over where and how it is mined, by whom and for whom.
Will More Austerity Work for Ireland? | <PARAGRAPH>  ALLIHIES, IRELAND—Life appears peaceful and idyllic on the famous green hills above white-capped seas and plunging cliffs on Ireland’s west coast. Woolly sheep graze on impossibly steep slopes; people chat inside prim pubs, walk dogs along ancient stone walls or tend immaculate gardens outside cute cottages. Aside from a scattering of vacant newish McMansion-style homes, there are no obvious signs of the economic distress that has clutched the country since the "Celtic Tiger" economic boom crashed and burned several years ago.  <PARAGRAPH>  But Ireland is indeed hurting economically, and the country is now center stage in the bitter controversy over how to ease Europe’s economic woes and decide the economic future of the European Union. On May 31, citizens will vote on whether to accept the European Union austerity treaty that played a significant role in recent political upheavals in France and Greece. Proponents say the treaty is essential to Ireland’s economic future, including its ability to get international loans and bailouts and attract private investment.  <PARAGRAPH>  <PICTURE>  <PARAGRAPH>  Opponents, including the Sinn Fein party, say the treaty would curb the country’s chances for economic growth and job creation, and sacrifice Ireland’s independence. "Austerity Isn’t Working – Stand Up for Ireland," read the "Vote No" banners along narrow country roads in coastal villages between the River Shannon and the Berea peninsula. In larger towns and cities in the region like Tralee and Ennis, "Yes" banners saying "Integrity, Stability, Recovery" and "Working for Ireland" far outnumber "No" banners.  <PARAGRAPH>  Contrary to some Irish pundits who indicate that the referendum’s results are up in the air and that Irish citizens may say "no," people I talked with over a week along the western coast feel that the treaty’s ratification is inevitable. Opinions varied on whether or not the treaty is actually a good thing for Ireland.  <PARAGRAPH>  An innkeeper on a tiny harbor on the Berea peninsula, where sheep and mussel farming are the main economic activities, is angry and exasperated that regular citizens have to pay for the malfeasance of politicians and big banks who got Ireland into its current dilemma. She thinks people will suffer because of the austerity measures, but she says the government is dead-set on passing the treaty and she believes it will get its way. A cab driver in Ennis said, "It has to pass; we don’t have a choice." The proprietor of a gift shop in the bustling town of Killarney plans to vote "no," saying, "We’ve given enough away already. You don’t get out of a recession that way."Sinn Fein politicians, including party president Gerry Adams, have been holding town hall meetings around the region – advertised on hand-lettered posters saying "all welcome" – to drum up support for a "no" vote. They are framing it as part of the party’s Defend Rural Ireland Initiative, and they stress that they are not against the EU or Eurozone and that Ireland can continue its membership without ratifying the treaty. They are also framing a "no" vote as part of a larger resistance movement to "big bullies," which includes opposition to fracking for natural gas in Ireland, ire over new household taxes and controversy over bans on cutting turf in bogs for environmental reasons (many small farmers cut their own peat to burn for heating and cooking).  <PARAGRAPH>  Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny was among the 25 European leaders who signed the treaty earlier this year, but each country still needs to ratify it through their own legislative procedures, with 12 ratifications out of 17 Eurozone countries needed for it to take effect in January 2013. The treaty limits the size of the deficit and debt a country is allowed to accrue, which opponents say will gut their potential for important government spending and hence economic growth in these tough times. So far, only Portugal, Slovenia and Greece -- under the former government -- have ratified the treaty.  <PARAGRAPH>  Newly elected French leader Francois Hollande said the country would not ratify, and the political turmoil in Greece means its ratification there is also highly in doubt. Now there is much talk of a "Grexit" – Greece's leaving the EU and the Eurozone altogether -- and Germany has canceled its own scheduled May treaty ratification vote, given the developments.  <PARAGRAPH>  At a press conference on May 15, Sinn Fein jobs spokesperson Peadar Toibin said:  <PARAGRAPH>  Only Government led investment in job creation will tackle the unemployment crisis and lead to growth and recovery….The fact is the government can’t have it both ways. You cannot have a twin track approach. The choice is austerity or investment in jobs. This Treaty would prevent the type of government led investment which is needed for economic recovery in this State.  <PARAGRAPH>  In March, Ireland's unemployment rate was at 10 percent, with its youth unemployment rate among the highest in Europe and many young people planning to emigrate. (Its unemployment rate is still notably lower than Spain and Greece, which were at 24 and 21 percent, respectively.) A recent report by the group Social Justice Ireland found that more than 700,000 citizens are living in poverty, a 13 percent increase from two years ago.  <PARAGRAPH>  The Irish parties pushing the treaty say it will mean less austerity in the long run because it will give private investors and lenders confidence in Ireland. Joining the treaty is essential to securing loans or other financing through the intergovernmental European Stability Mechanism (ESM), an in-the-works and trouble-plagued successor to similar international lending bodies.  <PARAGRAPH>  In an address Fianna Fail TD Michael Martin said:  <PARAGRAPH>  Voting Yes will ensure that Ireland has access to the cheapest and most secure funding for our public services - and it is an essential part of the agenda to restore growth and job creation to Ireland and Europe. In two years’ time Ireland will need to raise at least €18bn from somewhere. We want Ireland to be able to borrow that money at affordable rates on the open market.  <PARAGRAPH>  Ireland is the only country putting the treaty to a popular referendum, with the results playing a significant symbolic and pragmatic role in the overall outcome of the treaty. Other countries’ parliaments need a simple or super majority to ratify.  <PARAGRAPH>  A website about the treaty published by the Institute for International and European Affairs says that Ireland will not be forced to leave the Eurozone or EU if it votes "no" on the referendum, but that "a 'no' vote risks diminished influence for Ireland and potentially a second tier status for Ireland within the Eurozone."  <PARAGRAPH>  There were calls for the EU to relieve some of Ireland’s bank debt to help build support for the austerity treaty in the referendum, and a group of Irish TDs (members of Ireland’s lower house of parliament) called for the vote to be delayed until fall to see how events on the world stage shake out and to see if economic growth measures could be added to the treaty. Meanwhile, treaty proponents are calling for a second vote if the treaty is voted down on May 31.  <PARAGRAPH>  Some have argued that Ireland can survive on its own without bailouts, in part because of its attractiveness to U.S. and other high-tech companies. This is how Fintan O’Toole described the debate over the austerity treaty in an editorial in the Irish Times:  <PARAGRAPH>  One way of putting the referendum that I like is that Brussels and Germany are the mother and father of the EU and the rest of the countries are kids. And some kids spend the money wisely but some, like Ireland, spend it on crazy things. "So the mum and dad keep giving the kids more and more money. But eventually they put their foot down and say, ‘Right, you can keep borrowing our money – if you sign this form to let us know what you’ll use it for.’" This, apparently, is what we’re teaching our kids now – that we are all children, subject to our strict but benign parents in Brussels and Berlin.  <PARAGRAPH>  Like Sinn Fein, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has called for a massive government investment in creating jobs. This month, Congress general secretary David Begg called for a "New Deal" instead of the European austerity treaty. He also pushed for the delay of the ratification vote, given developments in France and Greece. A press release from the Congress quoted Begg saying:  <PARAGRAPH>  Ireland has been a poster child of globalisation and, more recently, a poster child for austerity. Let us seize the opportunity to be a beacon of something good for a change.  <PARAGRAPH>  It is of course widely believed that the best hope for "change" lie in a country’s youth, but since the economy crashed Ireland’s youth have been leaving the country in droves, with the number of young emigrants increasing three-fold since 2008, according to the April report by Social Justice Ireland. (That report also chronicled the country’s income inequality, noting that "the poorest 10 per cent of households have an average disposable income of €210 a week, compared to an average of €2,276 a week for the richest 10 per cent.")  <PARAGRAPH>  The Irish Times quoted Social Justice Ireland director Father Sean Healy on the likely impact of increased austerity measures on Ireland’s youth:  <PARAGRAPH>  The austerity programme is contributing to Ireland’s loss of young people, the implications of which are stark as this loss will pose significant problems for economic recovery…The emigration ‘brain drain’ which in some quarters is being heralded perversely as a ‘safety valve’ is in fact a serious problem for Ireland and may well lead to a skills deficit in the long-term.
New Chicago Air Cargo Center: More Chinese Imports, and More Jobs? | <PARAGRAPH> Chicago is often billed as the nation’s top destination and departure point for Chinese imports and exports. The city’s capacity for trade with China is supposed to get a big boost in the coming years because of a planned new $200 million cargo handling center at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, which was announced by Mayor Rahm Emanuel last week. <PARAGRAPH> The center drew praise from both labor and business leaders, as it is projected to create “more than 11,000” jobs—actually 1,200 temporary construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs, while indirectly sparking the creation of 10,000 jobs regionally. While the jobs are sorely needed and the Chicago Federation of Labor endorsed the plan in a joint statement with the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, skeptics question how great the jobs will actually be and, in principle, whether facilitating more imports of Chinese goods is a positive thing for local U.S. workers. <PARAGRAPH> The plan involves $62 million of city airport funds and a $130 million investment by the private firm Aeroterm LLC. The construction jobs will likely be filled by union members, but it is unclear from media coverage and the mayor’s announcement whether the permanent jobs at the center will be union or exactly what types of jobs are expected to be created indirectly. <PARAGRAPH> According to Crain’s Chicago Business, Aeroterm will act as the property manager and lease the cargo-handling facility out to customers. The story says there are no certain clients identified yet, but Aeroterm feels confident enough about prospects to put its money on the line. To anyone familiar with the logistics industry (essentially another form of cargo handling) often explored on this blog, the arrangement should raise some concerns. <PARAGRAPH> Warehouses where goods are received and restaged for delivery to big box stores and other facilities are typically owned by one company, operated by another and staffed and run by several more layers of subcontractors. The workforce is disproportionately made up of temporary contractors with no benefits or job security, and complaints of health impacts, sexual harrassment and discrimination are rampant. On the surface—albeit without a specific understanding of how the center will operate—it seems the O’Hare cargo handling center might raise similar problems. <PARAGRAPH> Labor’s support for the cargo center is interesting given that the service employee (SEIU) and UNITE-HERE unions have been trying to organize passenger service workers and concessions workers, respectively, at Chicago airports, and they say Emanuel’s policies are directly jeopardizing airport jobs and degrading working conditions—as David Moberg wrote for In These Times in March.   <PARAGRAPH> The center will tap graduates of the Chicago City Colleges enrolled in the aviation training program, one of the new job-focused programs the Emanuel administration is instituting at the City Colleges. Crain’s said the City College connection means it is likely that cargo center workers would be paid at least in part with TIF (tax increment financing) funds for six months before the private employer takes over their payroll. <PARAGRAPH> Based on the preliminary details so far available, it seems like this could, in the best case, be a way of leveraging public funds for significant private job creation and augmenting Chicago’s central location as a transit and trade hub…or, in the worst case, be another example of taxpayer funds being used to subsidize a private venture that creates largely temporary and nonunion jobs. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile the Rockford Register Star reports that the Chicago cargo center may compete with cargo expansion plans by the airport in Rockford—a working-class town 80 miles west of Chicago. The paper reports: <PARAGRAPH> In Rockford, airport officials continue to pursue cargo airlines. The airport says air cargo operators can save thousands of dollars per flight by landing here and trucking cargo to operations near O'Hare. The airport is also working to lure a company that provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services for cargo and passenger jets. <PARAGRAPH> I also wonder whether Chicago's new cargo center will affect the small airport and job prospects in hard-scrabble Gary, Ind., where civic leaders have long talked of expanding the airport and increasing its cargo handling to spur economic development. The Gary airport currently has almost no passenger traffic, instead relying largely on cargo.
Exiled Mexican Union Leader Wins Standoff With Govt. After Court Decision | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Union steelworkers and miners across North America celebrated last week as the Mexican Supreme Court dropped all criminal charges against Mineros (miners) union leader Napoleon Gomez Urrutia. Urretia had been living in Canada since 2006, subsidized by the United Steelworkers (USW) union, which has a formal partnership with the Mineros. <PARAGRAPH> The government had lodged serious corruption charges against Gomez in 2006 in what labor leaders in the U.S., Canada and Mexico saw as part of the government’s war on independent unions. Labor conflicts in Mexico include the high-profile strike at the Cananea copper mine and other mines in Mexico. Cananea, owned by Grupo Mexico, was shut down for three years by the strike until police ousted strikers and re-opened the mine (illegally, the union alleges) in 2010. <PARAGRAPH> Among other things, the government charged that Gomez had embezzled $55 million from the union. Supporters have always said the allegations were trumped up for political reasons, and the funds are now accounted for. The Canadian government refused to extradite Gomez and granted him legal residency. <PARAGRAPH> In a 3-1 vote, the Mexican Supreme Court’s Second Chamber ruled that the Mexican labor ministry had acted illegally when it revoked recognition of Gomez as General Secretary of the National Union of Mine, Metal and Steelworkers (aka Los Mineros). The court decided that only the union itself can decide whether a leader’s election and tenure is legitimate. <PARAGRAPH> Gomez’s supporters had said he has had “one foot back in Mexico” since late April, when a federal court granted an injunction that prevented his arrest. Now, all charges are dropped. <PARAGRAPH> USW President Leo Gerard said in a statement: <PARAGRAPH> Today's decision should sound the death knell for the Mexican government's vicious and illegal persecution of Napoleon Gomez and Los Mineros. <PARAGRAPH> A dissident group within the union has said it will file a complaint with the Organization of American States alleging that Gomez’s election to head the union was illegal, and that he should not head the union. <PARAGRAPH> Gomez’s supporters note that the Supreme Court decision does not mean he will be safe from further persecution and intimidation by state, federal or private actors in Mexico, which of course is wracked by violence, chaos and corruption related to the drug war that many argue has also facilitated attacks on organized labor and other activists. <PARAGRAPH> The government of Vicente Fox, elected in 2000, was known for attacking the independent trade union movement—specifically, the miners union. USW called for an international tourist boycott of Mexico after Fox’s government removed Gomez from leadership of the Mineros in 2006, with Gerard calling the move “naked aggression” and a “blatant attempt to stifle the voice of workers and all progressive unions in Mexico.” <PARAGRAPH> The government’s long-simmering animosity toward the progressive, independent miners union was exacerbated by the union’s high-profile opposition to the government’s decision to seal the Pasta de Conchos mine without recovering bodies or possibly survivors after a devastating Feb. 19, 2006, explosion. That mine, like Cananea, was owned by Grupo Mexico, which has close ties to the government. <PARAGRAPH> Persecution of Los Mineros continued under current president Felipe Calderon. Mexico’s presidential election on July 1 could see the PRI party, which had ruled for 71 years until 2000, reclaim the presidency from the conservative PAN. <PARAGRAPH> Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who lost by a narrow margin and refused to accept the results in 2006—swearing himself in and declaring an “alternate government”—is the candidate of the leftist PRD party. <PARAGRAPH> AMLO, as he is often known, is casting himself as more pro-business than last time around. He has promised not to nationalize private industries, but he is still considered much more pro-labor than the other candidates: the PAN’s Josefina Vazquez Mota and the PRI’s Enrique Pena Nieto, who propose loosening labor laws and courting more foreign investment. Lopez Obrador’s chances are slight, with polls showing only about a fifth of Mexicans support him.
A Shout-Out to GlobalPost’s Labor Series ‘Worked Over’ |  <PARAGRAPH> In its special report and ongoing series "Worked Over: The Global Decline of Labor Rights," the online news outlet GlobalPost offers up a rich and insightful diversity of stories about complicated labor struggles and situations around the world. <PARAGRAPH> A May 3 piece details the lack of opportunities and jobs for youth in South Africa, who face a 51-percent unemployment rate and see trade unions standing in the way of government programs to create more jobs for youth, since unionists fear employers will use youth to replace older workers and undercut the power of unions. <PARAGRAPH> The story notes that South African young people are as a whole highly educated, and this, combined especially with the legacy of apartheid—which relegated almost all black people to manual labor —means they are loathe to take even skilled labor jobs because of the "degrading ‘hoers and tillers’ image their parents acquired under apartheid." <PARAGRAPH> One story in the series highlights Spain’s overworked, underpaid and under-appreciated "army of one million waiters" as a symbol of the way labor law reforms billed as making Spain more competitive and reducing unemployment have backfired and divided workers: <PARAGRAPH> With food and drink so integral to Spain’s culture and services so important to its economy, waiters play a key role in society. But, [long-time water Mario] Castellanos explains, the relative drop in the profession’s wages, its unforgiving hours and the lack of opportunities to rise up through the ranks have undermined its social cache. And in many respects, the devaluation of waiting is representative of much broader changes in the Spanish labor market. <PARAGRAPH> Another recent story—the one that GlobalPost says was the impetus for the special report—talks about Bangladeshi workers suffering deadly fires and other dangers in factories where luxury American clothing is made for Tommy Hilfiger and other retailers. The story notes that workers are unionized in just 10 or 15 of the country’s thousands of garment factories. <PARAGRAPH> Bangladeshi garment-makers got international media attention after a December 2010 fire that killed 29 workers, and the industry and government promised sweeping changes. But, in fact, little has changed in terms of safety precautions or labor rights since the fire, according to GlobalPost, and repression of unions and worker organizing continues, as shown by the April murder of a prominent worker-leader. <PARAGRAPH> While China has continued to make news for sub-par labor conditions and child labor, the GlobalPost story posits that the situation is actually far more dire in Bangladesh. That’s where some of the most heated battles over future global labor rights likely lie. The May 1 story by Maher Sattar says: <PARAGRAPH> Finding that competing countries like China, India, and Vietnam are now too expensive, foreign brands are flocking to Dhaka to take advantage of the lowest wages in the world — less than half of the new minimum wage expected to be implemented in Cambodia, its closest competitor in terms of cheap labor. The typical Chinese wage minimum wage is now four to five times that of Bangladesh. <PARAGRAPH> "Bangladesh," said industry veteran Zia Ahad, "is the cheapest place under the sun." And according to labor activists, local factory owners, international retailers and the country’s government want to keep it that way. <PARAGRAPH> Several pieces in the report deal with labor rights in Colombia, including the lack of implementation of labor protections passed as a side agreement to the bilateral free trade pact that takes effect May 15; the ongoing violence against Colombian unionists; and the insidious role of so-called "labor co-ops." <PARAGRAPH> The co-ops are a major point of contention because they often serve as glorified temp agencies providing cheap labor to farms and businesses. Yet their members are considered small-business "owners" and are therefore banned from joining unions. <PARAGRAPH> The explosive growth of the palm oil industry in Colombia—driven in part by demand for clean-burning biodiesel and cooking oil without transfat—and the industry's dominance by the non-union co-ops has seriously undermined the union movement as a whole in the country, the report explains. <PARAGRAPH> Sweating in the mid-morning heat, Eusebio Rodriguez leads an oxcart between towering palm trees to gather their purple-and-orange fruit, which is used to make palm oil. Rodriguez, who earns about $15 a day for harvesting a ton and a half of palm fruit, would like to sign up with the local union. That would mean perks, like sick leave and paid vacations, as well as a helmet and gloves to protect his body from the porcupine-like spines protruding from the fruit. Instead, Rodriguez belongs to a cooperative which offers almost no benefits or job security. <PARAGRAPH> GlobalPost describes its special report Worked Over thus: <PARAGRAPH> It's been called a "race to the bottom." The hyper-accelerated movement of capital, jobs and resources from the world's international corporations — manufacturing, agriculture, service — to the lowest bidder. GlobalPost explores the human cost of such a race in an era of diminished expectations, broken promises and sleight of hand between governments, employers, unions and their workers. <PARAGRAPH> GlobalPost was founded in 2009 with the mission of producing web-only high-quality objective international news. It is a for-profit venture where every employee and correspondent is a "shareholder," and funds are raised through advertising, syndication and subscriptions to exclusive content. I don't know what kind of pay, support or job security GlobalPost offers its employees and correspondents;like most new experiments that have arisen since the journalism crisis, it is probably too early to tell how it will fare in the long run. <PARAGRAPH> But the Worked Over series, which mixes concise and hard-hitting analysis with colorful writing and beautiful slide shows, provides an encouraging example of how "new media" digital journalism can improve coverage of otherwise overlooked, important international and labor issues—rather than eroding the depth and quality of coverage, as often seems to be the case with the shift to instant, hyper-local and celebrity news driven by the never-ending quest for web traffic.
Chicago Lunch Ladies Push for Fresh Food for Students…and Job Security |  <PARAGRAPH> School cafeteria food is the butt of many jokes. Despite national attention and student activism aimed at making school lunches tastier and healthier, and federal regulations mandating more fruits and veggies that take effect July 1, word on the ground is that it still leaves much to be desired, to say the least. Prepackaged highly processed salty and sugary foods still make up a disproportionate part of the menu. And ironically, students, teachers and “lunch ladies” around the country have reported, many of the healthier new additions to cafeteria menus are going uneaten. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The union UNITE HERE Local 1, which represents 3,200 cafeteria workers in Chicago public schools, says this is the case in the more than 600 schools where they work. And they say school officials could have much more success with adding healthier options to the menu that students will actually eat if they consider more input from the cafeteria workers who talk with and observe the kids on a daily basis. <PARAGRAPH> Such worker input is now enshrined in a contract agreement signed between the union and the Chicago Board of Education this week, a measure the union is calling “landmark.” It also addresses the school district’s plans to increasingly replace actual cooking in many schools with “warming kitchens” where pre-made food would be warmed up. <PARAGRAPH> The union says that according to the school district’s 2008 bid solicitation for pre-made food, 178 elementary schools currently have only warming kitchens and – as of that time – that was the plan for all new elementary schools. UNITE HERE says pre-made food is bad for kids and also for cafeteria workers' job security. UNITE HERE senior research analyst Kyle Schafer said that hundreds of jobs could have been at risk if the school system went through with its previous plans for more warming kitchens. <PARAGRAPH> Schafer told me: <PARAGRAPH> We’ve lost a number of jobs in recent years – obviously it takes less folks to heat a meal than to make a meal from scratch. That’s how the history of institutional food service in schools has been going -- the move to more and more processed foods has largely been one to cut labor costs, not because anyone thought the food was better for the kids. This is both a more traditional labor issue and also a food issue in terms of how it affects the kids. <PARAGRAPH> The new five-year contract agreement stipulates that no full kitchens will be replaced by warming kitchens in existing schools, and the school board must consult with the union—giving them a chance to organize an opposition campaign—if they plan to build a new school with only a warming kitchen. <PARAGRAPH> Barbara Collins, a union member with more than 20 years working in school cafeterias, told me the provisions for worker input in the new contract are crucial to letting workers give kids food that is both healthy and that they will actually eat. She noted that recent switches for health reasons – like a shift from fried to baked potatoes – have been  nearly pointless since many kids won’t eat baked potatoes. Baked chicken has fared better among students, she noted. Such input from the workers who cook 77,000 breakfasts and 280,000 lunches for Chicago students each day will now be considered in developing new menus. <PARAGRAPH> “It’s kind of hard to feed children nowadays—it’s hard to please them,” Collins told me. “Our committee is going to come together and see if we can come up with some good ideas for the children.” <PARAGRAPH> The contract agreement capped a months-long campaign including rallies in January and April and two reports: "Feeding Chicago's Kids the Food they Deserve" in January – based on a survey of 436 school kitchen workers, and “Kitchens Without Cooks." As Collins indicated, the “Feeding” report found that 42 percent of workers thought students were not eating the new healthier menu items. <PARAGRAPH> Half of the respondents also said principals never eat cafeteria food – a finding that is not surprising but nonetheless is a bad sign. Perhaps most disturbingly, that study found that only 39 percent of cafeteria workers felt they could report concerns about food quality or safety to parents or others without fear of discipline, meaning almost two-thirds would likely stay silent even when they observed potential problems. <PARAGRAPH> A Chicago public schools teacher and parent, Sarah Wu, blogged anonymously -- fearing for her job -- for a year about horrendous cafeteria food. The Chicago Tribune described the offerings she consumed, often feeling sick as a result: <PARAGRAPH> …the surprising parade of plastic-wrapped, processed foods that appeared on her tray each day — from bagel dogs, popcorn chicken and Salisbury steak to green gelatin, peanut butter and jelly bars, and blue raspberry ice pops… <PARAGRAPH> Kitchens Without Cooks noted that nine out of 11 new elementary schools built since 2006 under a $1 billion program for modern schools include only warming kitchens. That means, the report says, that 81 percent of new elementary schools compared to 36 percent of older elementary schools serve frozen re-heated food. <PARAGRAPH> The report also quotes workers in various schools that have switched from cooking to “warming,” saying that students used to eat the food more when it was freshly-cooked. They say kids are more likely to throw away the food that resembles “TV dinners” – even if these meals are theoretically healthier “improvements” on the old fare. <PARAGRAPH> The Kitchens Without Cooks report quotes Tiffany Guynes, who is a kitchen worker at and also has a son attending the new Langston Hughes elementary school on the city’s south side. The study  says Guynes often packs a lunch for her son instead of letting him eat the food she serves the other students. <PARAGRAPH> The first day I walked into the cafeteria two questions came to my mind. Where is the stove? And where are the cooks? We don’t have either at Langston Hughes…I wouldn’t eat a lot of this food. If it’s not good enough for me, it’s not good enough for my son. <PARAGRAPH> The reports jibed with other media reports, including a November 2011 report by The Chicago Tribune that participation in school meal programs had dropped to 70 percent since healthier options were added, even though 82 percent of students were eligible for subsidized meals. <PARAGRAPH> Collins—whose four kids and 20-plus grandkids went to or are going to Chicago Public Schools —thinks the new contract is a start in helping both cafeteria workers and kids. She said: <PARAGRAPH> My crew, we take good care of the children. If a child is hungry they really can’t learn. If we feed them properly breakfast and lunch, they’ll do better. I want to see a smile on their face.
