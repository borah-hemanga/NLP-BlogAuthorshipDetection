Campaigns look past the polls | <paragraph> This year's polling data gets more confusing by the day. <paragraph> Barack Obama supporters trash Gallup's methodology as biased and skewed. Mitt Romney partisans seem to attack ANY poll that shows their candidate down — especially in Ohio. Like many in the news business, I spent the past few days on the phone with leaders of both campaigns to get a better grasp on how the final stretch will play out. <paragraph> The contrast in the two camps' thinking was striking. <paragraph> All the president's men believe they have built a turnout machine over the past five years like no other in American political history. Team Obama has been on the ground for five years in Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Iowa, New Hampshire and every other swing state that matters. They have reached out and touched more voters personally than Romney, the Republican National Committee and local party leaders combined. And they believe that five-year head start will lead to victory on Election Day. <paragraph> The Romney campaign is now relying more on the intangibles of the political trade. Boston expects to be swept to victory on Election Day because of debate momentum, partisan passions and that evergreen emotion voters always carry with them into the voting booth called "Change." The great irony for the Romney camp is that their candidate, who has been driven by data and numbers his entire life, now has to rely on the most unpredictable and maddening force of all — human emotion — to carry him over the top and into the White House. <paragraph> Still, neither side dared predict an outcome, and both campaigns are as clueless as to the election's final outcome as you and me. <paragraph> That means the last 10 days are going to be a wild ride for the campaigns, the candidates and the country they both want to run.
A narrow Obama win or a Romney landslide | <paragraph> Mika, Willie and I have spent the past few weeks answering the same question from viewers, family members and friends. "Who's going to win the election??" <paragraph> After the first debate, that question was asked in the form of a plea from Democrats. Before that, Republicans grimly asked for their prognosis, resigned to the fact that the answer would not be satisfying. <paragraph> I spent most of the year telling those who asked that the dynamics of the race suggested a narrow Barack Obama win. But that all changed after the president's Denver debacle. After that meltdown, I am the first to admit I have no idea how this will turn out. <paragraph> But I do know this: Mitt Romney will win the presidency if he wins Ohio. That's because the Republican candidate is nailing down the Southern swing states that he has to win. With Florida, North Carolina and Virginia moving his way, the battle now moves to the Midwest. <paragraph> If Romney's momentum is strong enough to erase the 10-point deficit he once faced in Ohio, expect him to carry other swing states like Nevada and Colorado. <paragraph> That scenario would have been far more plausible had Mr. Romney turned in a stronger performance at last night's debate in Florida. As things stand today, Ohio is still a heavy lift for the GOP candidate and that means President Obama should still be considered a slight favorite to win reelection. <paragraph> But my gut tells me there are two likely scenarios: (1) President Obama will squeak out a narrow Electoral College victory or (2) Mitt Romney will carry Ohio and be swept into office by a comfortable margin. <paragraph> After practicing politics for 20 years, I suppose I would rather be in Mitt Romney's shoes than Barack Obama's. Incumbents who are under 50 percent two weeks out usually go down to defeat. <paragraph> But who knows? Maybe Barack Obama will bend history once again.
Romney's Electoral College gains | <paragraph> Is Mitt Romney surging ahead of Barack Obama in the battleground states that will elect the next president? USA Today says "yes" and insiders in the Democratic Party are growing more concerned by the day that the President's built-in advantage in the Electoral College has all but disappeared. <paragraph> A new USA Today/Gallup poll has Romney leading President Obama by 4 percentage points among likely voters in 12 battleground states. The reason? USA Today says women in these swing states are moving Mitt's way. Time Magazine's Mark Halperin is also reporting tonight in an Electoral College update that a top Democratic source is worrying for the first time that Ohio may be slipping out of the Obama column and moving toward the tossup pile. <paragraph> Halperin explains: “This doesn't mean Romney has the upper hand right now. But it is no longer at all  implausible that he could take the three Southern battlegrounds and Ohio. If he does that,  he sure as heck would have the upper hand.  And that leaves at least some Democrats with the shakes.” <paragraph> Just yesterday, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll had President Obama surging ahead of Mitt Romney and breaking past the 50 percent mark, so who knows what the next poll brings. But one thing is certain, the tightening race does give us all one more reason to tune into Tuesday night's presidential debate.
39 percent? | <paragraph> It was a startling announcement that got too little attention: Earlier this month the Federal Reserve issued findings showing that the median U.S. household lost nearly 39 percent of its wealth from 2007 to 2010. <paragraph> If you're looking for a missing decimal point--surely it's 3.9 percent, you might think--you're looking in vain. <paragraph> Anyone who cares about America's place in the 21st Century economy should find this 39 percent figure depressing for all the obvious reasons.  But that shocking statistic also makes our task all the more clear: we must grow our way back into confidence and prosperity. And we get to decide whether Obama or Romney has the best chance of achieving that. <paragraph> That's a hell of a debate. But the Fed numbers show that the winner of that battle will have a historic task on his hands come next January.
Swing-state math breaks for Obama | <paragraph> Ronald Reagan's run to the White House was quickened by sluggish economies throughout America's most important political swing states in 1980. Those states' downturns doomed the then-sitting Democratic president. <paragraph> Three decades later, a different swing state dynamic may end up helping the current Democratic president living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. <paragraph> A quick look at the latest labor statistics actually shows surprising strength in America's most vital political swing states. <paragraph> Ohio's unemployment rate has been dropping steadily for a year now, and currently sits at 7.3%. Florida's unemployment rate is now 8.6%, a full two percentage points below where it was just one year ago. And Virginia's unemployment rate remains stubbornly low, as that state's Republican governor lines himself up as a possible VP choice. <paragraph> Add the lift that Barack Obama will surely get from Michigan and other Industrial Midwest states aided by the auto bailout and suddenly this year's swing state math seems to break President Obama's way. <paragraph> Of course, it is only June. And as any good Red Sox fan knows, the games don't really start to count until after Labor Day.
The next great depression? |   <paragraph>  If the world slides into a global depression over the next year, consider yourself forewarned by the Wall Street Journal. Yesterday's edition was packed with so many grim headlines that one could be forgiven for believing that we could be seeing cash-filled wheelbarrows by the end of the summer.  <paragraph>  In what could have been called the Black Friday issue, the Journal reported on: - an Asian slowdown brought on by European woes - India's economy sputtering to a nine-year low - a continued economic slowdown in China - weakness coming out of South Korea and Australia - a growing banking crisis in Spain - a deepening of Greece's economic collapse - increased economic problems across Africa - the desperate plea of European bankers for a unified rescue fund   <paragraph>  Yet another WSJ story reported that President Obama was aggressively weighing in on the European debt crisis, urging EU leaders to make tough choices to prevent the kind of crisis that propelled him into the White House four years ago. The Journal wrote of a growing concern in the White House that a similar crisis could be responsible for his defeat four years after the September 15th meltdown.  <paragraph>  Adding to the grimness of Friday's morning edition was a jobs report that landed on Wall Street with a thud at 8:30 a.m.. Yesterday's depressing jobs report was terrible news for the president and the millions of Americans who are still struggling to find a job.  <paragraph>  The economic data released this week was not much better for some of the U.S.'s top employers.  <paragraph>  The screaming headline "Business Braces for Europe's Worst" was splashed across the top of the Journal's Marketplace section. Companies like McDonald's, Carnival and Goodrich are sure to see their earnings hit hard by a sagging European economy.  <paragraph>  That is bad news for U.S. workers and for a president who has five months left to prove that his policies have reversed an economic slide that he inherited in 2008. Chicago's argument keeps getting tougher to make every month, with the backdrop of an economy that seems to be growing weaker by the day.
An enduring sacrifice few can understand |   <paragraph> I remember moving past the generals and politicians to greet grief-stricken family members who lost a loved one at Khobar Towers. The 1996 terrorist attack killed 19 U.S. servicemen stationed in Saudi Arabia and several of those killed in the attack were stationed at Eglin Air Force Base in the heart of my congressional district.  <paragraph>  I quietly shook hands with the parents who lost their sons, the wives who lost their husbands and the sisters who lost their brothers. And as is usually the case when military tragedies curse families, one can do little more in their presence than pray for the fallen and offer assistance for those family members left behind.  <paragraph>  I slowly made my way down the receiving line until I was stopped by the sight of a young boy who was staring ahead vacantly across the room, past the generals and politicians who were walking by to pay their last respects to his dad. My eyes began to well up at his sight and I moved quickly to hug the boy. All I could whisper was that I was so sorry for his loss. I moved away just as quickly to hide my eyes from him and go outside for the ceremony.  <paragraph>  The fact that the boy was the same age as my oldest son in 1996 is why I still remember that jarring encounter on this Memorial Day 16 years later. This morning I recall all I shared with my sons over those 16 years: the Little League games I got to coach, the birthday parties I got to attend, the Christmas Eve candlelight services I enjoyed with my family, the prom pictures I forced Joey and Andrew to endure while their dates smiled and they just stood there squirming in their misfitting tuxes.  <paragraph>  All these years later, I still pray to God every night that I will be around to see them graduate, get married, have children and move safely into middle age -- all the things this young boy would endure without his dad. I also pray that children of the fallen have loved ones to pick up the pieces and move them forward toward a fulfilled life, but I know that is not always the case.  <paragraph>  When we talk about the American heroes who give their all for their country, I wonder how many people realize that their sacrifice continues being paid every day. Then I wonder why Washington refuses to treat those heroes who come home with the respect they deserve.  <paragraph>  On this Memorial Day, let us hope that one day soon they will. May God bless our fallen heroes and their family members today and far into the future.
Time again for Obama to lead from behind |   <paragraph>  Today, Sunday morning newspapers around the world screamed with headlines announcing yet another tragedy out of Syria. Journalists inside the war-torn country report that forces aligned with Bashar al-Assad massacred at least 90 Syrians with indiscriminate mortar attacks on civilian targets; more than 30 children were among the dead.  <paragraph>  The massacre in Houla is another example of how deadly Kofi Annan's Syrian cease-fire has been for civilians who still believe the international community will actually do something to prevent further slaughter. After yesterday's attacks, Syrians have reason to become increasingly bitter at the United States for sitting back over the past year and doing very little while Assad murdered 10,000 of his own citizens.    <paragraph>  Imagine how difficult it must be for the mother of a Syrian child killed by Assad's bloodied hands to grasp the geopolitical complexities that compelled the United States to launch air attacks against Muammar Gadhafi's Libya (in the name of protecting civilians) while the same superpower has sat idly by while its enemy indiscriminately kills his fellow countrymen. The reality is that the Administration's Libya and Syria policies cannot be squared in a way that makes sense to even the most gifted foreign-policy analyst.   <paragraph>  It would be depressing to believe that the greatest sin 10,000 dead Syrians had on their heads before being killed was to have the bad luck of not being born in an oil-rich country like Libya. And yet I am not cynical enough to believe that such crude calculations enter the minds of American presidents.   <paragraph>  But with every unanswered massacre that Assad launches, Americans and members of the international community can be forgiven for possessing a healthy dose of skepticism.  <paragraph>  That's why it is time once again for Barack Obama to lead from behind. His patience toward Libya last year angered neoconservative hawks who would've preferred the president launch attacks first and ask questions later. But he wisely chose instead to give the Arab League and our European allies enough time and space to take the lead against Gadhafi's ruthless regime. It was then left, of course, to American men and women in uniform to help drive the Libyan dictator from power. They did just that, and the president was rightly praised for his shrewd handling of the crisis.   <paragraph>  The growing crisis in Syria calls for a similar approach. Fortunately, the president has already declared that Mr. Assad must go. His administration has also wisely continued to ramp up pressure on Russia.   <paragraph>  But the president must do more, by focusing intense pressure on allies and unbearable pressure on enemies to drive Bashar al-Assad from power. That outcome is not only a moral imperative. It is also in the United States long-term strategic interest.  <paragraph>  That is why it is time for a repeat performance from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
Are we all big government conservatives now? |   <paragraph>  Every year, liberal bloggers and talk show hosts become unhinged when polls are released that suggest conservatives outnumber liberals by a 2-to-1 margin. This past year left-wing bloggers became particularly unhinged when a fact-checking organization declared it "mostly true" that the majority of Americans were conservative. Apparently, Politifact's opinion on the semantic difference between  "plurality" and "majority" was of such great import to American liberals that this fake controversy warranted weeks of ideological screeching.  <paragraph>  Hold on to your Cheetos sports fans, because Gallup just <hyperlink> released its annual poll on voters' ideological bent, and once again self-described conservatives outnumbered liberals by a 2-to-1 margin. In fact, 46% of Americans now call themselves "economic conservatives" while only 20% describe themselves as "liberal".  <paragraph>  Predictably, fewer voters labeled themselves "conservative" on social issues.  <paragraph>  So let the screaming match begin between ideological camps. But for those interested in how voters' attitudes will impact the 2012 presidential election, the Gallup poll's trend line suggest that voters are becoming more economically conservative as a reaction to George W. Bush and Barack Obama's big bailouts in 2008 and 2009, and the never-ending debate over health care.  <paragraph>  The obvious irony is that while Americans like to think of themselves as rugged individualists who are perfectly capable of pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, these same cowboys would tar and feather any leader who tried to curb spending on Medicare, Social Security, farm subsidies, defense contracts, student loans or any other part of America's $4 trillion budget.   <paragraph>  So perhaps we are dealing with the self-delusion of citizens who are every bit as addicted to massive government spending as their European cousins. Still, delusional voters are allowed into voting booths on election day. That means Barack Obama had better learn to channel Bill Clinton sooner rather than later-- and praise the glories of small government individualism while running a federal government whose debt is racing toward $20 trillion.
Chicago books mayor for telling truth |  <paragraph>  Only Nixon could go to China, only Clinton could pass welfare reform and only Cory Booker could draw blood by  <hyperlink>  calling out Barack Obama. <paragraph>  That's because Republicans have called President Obama every name in the book over the past four years --from Marxist to fascist to racist. During that time, the right-wing noise machine spewed out such a steady stream of insults toward Mr. Obama that most swing voters simply don't pay attention to those howlers who keep crying wolf.  <paragraph>  Enter <hyperlink>   Cory Booker.  <paragraph>  The formerly fast-rising Democratic star and Obama surrogate went on "Meet the Press" Sunday morning to blast his candidate's populist attacks on venture capitalism. In so doing, the Newark mayor committed a terrible gaffe by Washington standards.  <paragraph>  He told the truth.  <paragraph>  Now he will surely pay a steep political price for his honesty. Never mind the fact that many of the big money contributors who made Barack Obama's historic election possible four years ago continue to practice the same brand of capitalism that made Mitt Romney rich. And many of those contributors are being asked once again to support Barack Obama's campaign.  <paragraph>  Cory Booker may have been forced to  <hyperlink> produce a hostage video last night, but it is Barack Obama who remains handcuffed today to the same big money capitalists that he still blames for ruining America.
These are not the Times to be biased | <paragraph>  Maybe I shouldn't be so tough on those I love. God knows I would have more friends in my own political party if I had kept my mouth shut while George W. Bush was running up trillions in debt and aping Woodrow Wilson on the world stage. But I can't help myself. Maybe I just expect more from those I love.  <paragraph>  Which brings me to the New York Times. I often criticize the Old Gray Lady despite the fact it's the one newspaper I must read daily.  <paragraph>  I expect its editorial page to reflect the liberal community it serves. And I endure its left-leaning story selection because it also brings the best writing and reporting in the world to my doorstep. But it tends to embarrass itself occasionally during heated presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>  The Times' public editor recently scolded his paper's past cheerleading for Barack Obama, and for good reason. The paper published separate profiles of John and Cindy McCain during the peak of the 2008 campaign that smeared the GOP nominee and his wife. When this kind of slanted reporting wins the day, I am as distressed at the Times' failings as I am when Republican politicians stop being conservative and start being radical. <paragraph>  This past week the Newspaper of Record ran a story above the fold on page one reporting that Republicans were preparing a new round of attacks on Barack Obama's relationship with Jeremiah Wright. They followed that Thursday story with a follow up article the next day. And then today, the Times' "Political Memo" stirred the pot again by writing this:  <paragraph>  A report in The New York Times on Thursday exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama’s onetime pastor, and his angry black-power sermons.  <paragraph>  Perhaps this news story might justify a three day roll out if, in fact, that narrative were accurate. Sadly, for the New York Times and Barack Obama's campaign, it is not.  <paragraph>  Despite what the Times claims, the undisputed facts are these: 1. There was no "secret plan" by "strategists" or "financiers" to push the Wright story, 2. The super pac in question asked advertisers to bring them ad ideas focused on the federal debt, 3. The ad man who pitched the idea to the super pac conceded that the group did not want proposals that dealt with anything other than fiscal issues, 4. Mitt Romney and his campaign had nothing to do with anything involving this ad. 5. The Republican Party had nothing to do with anything involving this pitch.   <paragraph>  Anyone who has spent any time working on a political campaign knows that terrible ideas bubble up and are popped by smart managers every five minutes or so. The fact that the New York Times decided to seize on a stupid idea by a guy not connected to (a) the super pac, (b) the RNC or (c) the Romney campaign shows just how much of a stretch it was to put Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg's story on the top of page one.  <paragraph>  Zeleny and Rutenberg are great reporters. And their story calling out a single strategist for pushing this self-destructive idea should find its way into the news stream. But until the New York Times begins publishing the moronic ideas of Democratic ad men making pitches to George Soros or Ted Turner, they should limit their breathless attacks against a political party they clearly oppose.  <paragraph>  This responsibility falls on the shoulders of editors who need to show a bit more partisan restraint on page one during election years. Such restraint will help them avoid the perception that they are shamelessly cheerleading for Democrats while maintaining the loyalty of many readers who do not share the editors' political views.
The widening partisan divide |   <paragraph>  There they go again.  <paragraph>  The White House and Congress are starting to circle each other in another mindless default dawdle while Greece teeters, Italy shakes, Spain splinters and France frets. The Eurozone's southern states are staggering toward insolvency while millions of Europeans cope with Depression-style suffering.  <paragraph>  The Greek political system is suffering a nervous breakdown, with spoiled voters almost certainly assuring an economic meltdown and Greece's exit from the EU.  <paragraph>  Spain's economy is strapped with a 25 percent unemployment rate that tops out at 50 percent for that nation's young workers. The situation has gotten so bad that its prime minister is now fretting that his country may soon be shut out of world markets. Italy's debt now equals a staggering 120 percent of its nation's GDP while the country suffers through three straight quarters of economic decline.  <paragraph>  Now the rest of Europe waits nervously to see how the dominoes falling in Athens will affect Rome, Paris and Berlin.  <paragraph>  Meanwhile, U.S. politicians continue playing the same insipid Washington games that have led our country to a record $16 trillion debt. Over the past 24 hours, GOP House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid exchanged barbs about yet another default showdown, while President Obama called both sides into the White House so he could quickly leak details of his scolding lecture to lawmakers.  <paragraph>  That's sure to seal the deal, Mr. President.  <paragraph>  Taken together, the events of the past 24 hours prove that our national leaders remain locked in trench warfare where neither side dares to cross the ever widening partisan divide.  <paragraph>  Politically, some House members will probably benefit from such reckless, ideological behavior. But the president will not. It will be incumbent upon him to show independent voters just how aggressively he will fight over the next four years to bring deficit spending under control. Leave it to Bill Clinton to understand the moment at hand and figure out how to capitalize politically. Tuesday night, while mere politicians were lobbing spit balls at each other, the former president addressed the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and declared that facing down the budget crisis should be "front and center" in the 2012 campaign.  <paragraph>  Before left wing bloggers attack Mr. Clinton, they should remember that this is the same Democratic president who bloodied his Republican enemies by declaring that "the era of big government is over."  <paragraph>  Of course it wasn't by a long shot but then-President Clinton knew that the best way to win independent voters away from the GOP was by avoiding the label of "big government liberal." He signed a Republican welfare reform bill, promised to balance the budget and then got easily reelected in 1996.  <paragraph>  Barack Obama needs to perform a similar magic trick 16 years later.  <paragraph>  Despite the Republican Party's gallant efforts over the last six months to destroy their brand and help reelect their enemy, President Obama still trails a listless opponent in many polls. He is scoring poorly with voters on the economy. And too many independent voters dismiss him (for good reason) as a big spending liberal. To turn things around, the White House needs to follow Clinton's example and set up its GOP opponents.  <paragraph>  That will require a bold strategy and a new kind of thinking at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It will demand a big idea on long-term debt reduction and short term growth. And that bold strategy will include President Obama's strong endorsement of the Simpson-Bowles plan to save America from economic insolvency. Liberals will protest, Democratic candidates will squeal, but it is the White House's best chance to put Mitt Romney in a corner and win over independent voters.  <paragraph>  It really shouldn't be that hard considering that Mr. Obama would only be endorsing the conclusions of his own debt commission.
Chris Christie defies gravity | <paragraph>  Once upon a time, the Northeast was ruled by Republicans.  <paragraph>  Yankee politicians like New York's Teddy Roosevelt, Massachusetts' Henry Cabot Lodge, Connecticut's Prescott Bush, New Hampshire's Warren Rudman, Rhode Island's John Chafee, Maine's William Cohen and Vermont's James Jeffords represented more than a century of GOP dominance in the North that began with the presidency of Abraham Lincoln and ended with George W. Bush's election.  <paragraph>  So overwhelming was GOP dominance in New England that the Democratic Party failed to win a single presidential contest in Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine throughout the 1970s and 1980s. That reality shifted dramatically in 1992. In fact, Republicans in presidential contests have lost all states north of Virginia since 1988, other than Bush's single victory in New Hampshire in 2000.  <paragraph>  These bitter realities that face all Northeast Republicans makes New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's latest poll numbers all the more remarkable.  <paragraph>  As noted by Chris Cillizza's "The Fix", Christie’s 56 percent approval rating in a recent Fairleigh Dickinson University poll tops President Obama's standing in that state as well as the approval ratings of New Jersey's two Democratic U.S. senators. In fact, neither Bob Menendez nor Frank Lautenberg have ever registered an approval rating as high the one Christie currently enjoys.  <paragraph>  How terrifying it must be to Democratic activists in the Garden State that Republican Chris Christie is one of the most popular politicians in the recent history of their very blue state. The New Jersey governor just brokered a tough collective bargaining deal with his state's largest unions so you can expect those high approval ratings to continue for a while.  <paragraph>  There are many lessons for Republicans to take away from Christie's success:  <paragraph>  1. FOCUS ON MATH, NOT IDEOLOGY When you focus on fixing deficits by showing voters raw numbers, independents and editorial boards will follow you. When you follow your base blindly into ideological fights (like abolishing collective bargaining before your state is ready for that), you take unnecessary risks.  <paragraph>  2. THINK BIG Friends of Chris Christie never expected him to be a transformative governor. But candidate Christie knew that New Jersey's finances were so screwed up that if he got elected, his only option would be to throw all he had at knocking down the state's debt. Going to war was a risk, but his greater risk would have been to do nothing at all. As the Templar Knight at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade said, "He chose wisely." And as I always said to politicians who came to my office seeking advice, "Nobody ever stops you when you're going 90 miles per hour."   <paragraph>  3. BE YOURSELF Chris Christie is a Jersey guy. He ain't going to be invited to the Newport Debutante Ball anytime soon. And even if he were, he'd probably decline the invitation. That's because Chris Christie is an unapologetic street fighter who doesn't bother playing nice for the cameras.  <paragraph>  Sometimes he comes across as a bully. Sometimes he talks when he should be quiet. Sometimes he might even embarrass himself. But know this: Chris Christie is always himself. And for New Jersey voters, that's good enough.
Politics and the endless war |  <paragraph>  The president's prime-time address tonight put a bow on the political gift Osama bin Laden's death provided Team Obama.  <paragraph>  Did the White House politicize the terror chief's death? Of course. Is it breaking news that an administration would do such a thing? Of course not.  <paragraph>  In 1960, John Kennedy created a missile gap with the Soviets out of thin air to defeat Richard Nixon.  <paragraph>  Four years later, LBJ shamelessly used his "Daisy" ad to suggest that a Goldwater administration would cause a nuclear war.  <paragraph>  In 1968, Richard Nixon lied about a secret plan to get out of Vietnam.  <paragraph>  In 2002, Karl Rove and the GOP used September 11th as a wedge issue against Democratic candidates.  <paragraph>  And in 2012, President Obama is using the killing of Osama bin Laden as a political tool.  <paragraph>  If you are shocked by such things, get over it. Be more concerned  with the president's declaration that U.S. troops will be in Afghanistan until 2024. That reality means Americans who were not even born on Sept. 11, 2001, will be occupying Afghanistan 20 years after those attacks. Never mind that the epicenter of Al Qaeda's operation has moved to Yemen or that U.S. taxpayers are doling out $2 billion a week on a war whose main purpose is propping up one of the most corrupt regimes on the face of the Earth.  <paragraph>  Making matters worse is the fact that Mr. Obama's opponents in the GOP want to stay longer. <paragraph>  The takeaway of President Obama's speech tonight is simple. The neocons won, the troops lost and the endless war grinds on in a land that humbled the Soviet Union, the British Empire and Alexander the Great. Good luck with that, Mr. President.
Hoover, Carter and cheap shots |  <paragraph>  "Politics ain't beanbag," wrote Finley Peter Dunne in an 1895 newspaper column explaining how Washington is not for the weak-hearted. And Mr. Dunne was right.  <paragraph>  All those hoping to find charity, love and justice on the campaign trail would do best to seek out the nearest church pew to rest their weary bones. That is because young politicians are taught daily just how rough the sport can be.  <paragraph>  In Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy's new book The President's Club, we see time and again how ex-presidents have been swept aside with brutish efficiency by the incoming president - whether it was Dwight Eisenhower coldly dispatching his former boss Harry Truman or John Kennedy dismissing Ike eight years later because he believed wrongly that the old general was hopelessly out of touch.   <paragraph>  But one of the most glaring examples of a president throwing a high, inside fastball on one of his predecessors was after Harry Truman had used Herbert Hoover from 1945 through 1948 to save millions of Europeans from starving after World War II. Truman also tapped Hoover to reorganize the federal government in a way that dramatically impacts even Barack Obama today. The alliance between Truman and Hoover was historic and, before long, the formerly disgraced GOP president became one of the most-admired men in America.   <paragraph>  Then came the 1948 election.  <paragraph>  Although Hoover gave the president his word that he would remain positive throughout the election, Gibbs and Duffy tell us that Harry Truman unloaded on the man who helped him save Europe from starvation and Soviet influence. On the campaign trail he would blame Hoover and the Republicans for causing the Great Depression while privately he would say, "That man was no more responsible for starting the Depression than you or me."  <paragraph>  But for Truman, politics was a tough game played by tough men, so he didn't give his strategy a second thought. And although Herbert Hoover was hurt by his friend's attacks, he swallowed his pride and continued his efforts reorganizing the executive branch for Truman and his successors.  <paragraph>  Given the long history of former presidents being used as political punching bags, I suppose I should not be surprised that these kind of attacks continue today. But I do wish ex-presidents would show the dignity and grace of George H.W. Bush in respecting the office of the presidency so much that they would choose to refrain from besmirching a member of the President's Club.  <paragraph>  I know this sounds old-fashioned and a bit out of touch with the realities of the 24/7 culture but I still revere the presidency even if I have been less than thrilled with the performance of some of its recent occupants.  <paragraph>  Which leads to a story that POLITICO is covering today regarding a man who hopes to become a member of the President's Club next January. Today, we heard Mitt Romney take a shot at the 39th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter. In responding to a reporter's question as to whether Romney would have ordered an attack on Osama bin Laden, the Republican front-runner said that "even Jimmy Carter would have ordered the attack."   <paragraph>  That a GOP candidate would use Carter as a political target is not a surprise. We Republicans - and I include myself here - have been using President Carter as a political target for as long as Democrats lashed out at Hoover. But considering that Carter did the unthinkable by 2012 standards last week and praised Mitt Romney, I found his cheap shot at President Carter to be a bit jarring.  <paragraph>  Also, I wonder if there should be a statute of limitations on the political attacks the 39th president has to absorb. As a conservative who has been criticizing the former president for almost four decades now, I say enough is enough. All one has to do is read a few pages of Jimmy Carter's White House Diary or his recent Bible guide to get a better understanding of the challenges that constantly faced the man from Plains when he lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  <paragraph>  His were the same kind of monumental crises that Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton stared down daily. And while I will be the first to say that the people and the press have every right to challenge a sitting president every step of the way, I would suggest that after a president has been out of the Oval Office for 30 years, politicians should look elsewhere for cheap shots.
George W. Bush's friends on the left |   <paragraph>  For a president who left office loathed by progressives and most of polite society, <hyperlink> George W. Bush continues to gain admirers among those whom liberals admire most.  <paragraph>   <hyperlink>  U2 frontman and legendary do-gooder Bono shocked many when he told Jon Stewart that George W. Bush did an "amazing" job in his work involving AIDS in Africa.  <paragraph>  "I know that's hard for you to accept," Bono told the host, "but George kind of knocked it out of the park. I can tell you, and I'm actually here to tell you that America now has 5 million people being kept alive by these drugs. That's something that everyone should know."  <paragraph>  Another secular saint of the left, Sir Bob Geldof, has been even more direct in his praise of the conservative ex-president.  <paragraph>  Geldof told reporters that he was "pissed off" by the media's refusal to report the truth about Bush's good works, saying that when it came to saving Africa, George W. Bush "has done more than any other president so far."  <paragraph>  "This is the triumph of American policy really," he said. "It was probably unexpected of the man. It was expected of the nation, but not of the man, but both rose to the occasion."  <paragraph>  "What's in it for Mr. Bush? Absolutely nothing," Geldof told reporters.  <paragraph>  Then there is the interview that is airing Wednesday on  <hyperlink> Piers Morgan in which the CNN host asks His Holiness what leaders he respects. After bringing up Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama then moves on to a more unlikely politician.  <paragraph>  "I love President Bush," the Dalai Lama said.  "Which one?" Morgan asked.  "The younger one."   Shocked by the response, Morgan asked incredulously, "Really?"   "Yes, really," the Dalai Lama insisted, "I love him."  <paragraph>  ( <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Dalai Lama: I love George W. Bush)  <paragraph>  Those strong words from His Holiness surprise even conservatives like myself who faulted Bush for huge deficits and a reckless foreign policy. But reading this lavish praise from the likes of the Dalai Lama, Bono and Bob Geldof should remind narrow-minded leftists who view Mr. Bush through ideological blinders that turning political opponents into cartoon characters is the work of fools. <paragraph>  And for conservatives who have spent the past three years calling Barack Obama every name in the book, that applies to you as well. We can disagree with our political opponents without turning them into evil villains. As the Dalai Lama himself once famously said, "Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible."
Let the horse race begin |  <paragraph>  No sooner did Rick Santorum leave the Republican race for president than Gallup announced the start of its daily tracking poll. That means that every afternoon for the next 201 days, we will be greeted with horse-race updates that are sure to be followed by breathless headlines about how that day's results surely spell doom for President Obama or Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>  On this second day of Gallup's tracking poll, the survey was met with a screaming headline on The Drudge Report that yelled "SHOCK POLL!" So what's the earth-shattering news that deserved such a headline? It's that Mitt Romney leads the president by five points - 48% to 43%.  <paragraph>  Put as much stock in this poll as the ones that declared a few weeks back that the president was ahead of Romney by double digits. The next time you believe a result like that, step away from your laptop, get out of your mother's basement and take a walk around the block.  <paragraph>  Both campaigns will tell anyone who is listening that the Obama-Romney showdown will be decided in the final weeks of the campaign - with the outcome resting on unemployment rates, gas prices and their impact on swing states like Florida, Ohio and Virginia.  <paragraph>  So take a deep breath. We are still in the preseason for presidential campaigns. As the Boston Red Sox cruelly taught their fans again last season, winning big in the spring doesn't mean jack. It's how your side performs when the leaves start to change colors. Considering they still haven't sprouted throughout most of New England, this race still has a long way to go.
Economic help for Obama |   <paragraph>  The Wall Street Journal editorial page usually has little good to say about <hyperlink>  President Obama's economic agenda. But today's Journal was brimming with good news for a White House facing reelection during tough economic times. From front to back, the WSJ was filled with upbeat  <hyperlink>   economic news. Considering Friday's disappointing jobs numbers, the good news must have been a welcome respite for the White House.  <paragraph>  The paper's lead article showcased a study declaring that U.S. companies were emerging stronger from the Great Recession than they were even before the 2008 financial meltdown. The Journal quoted Wells Fargo's former chief economist who said the last few years have made U.S. companies "leaner, meaner and hungrier." That positive sentiment was backed by a WSJ analysis that showed sales, profits and employment higher among the Standard and Poor's companies than in 2007.  <paragraph>  That front page story was coupled with hopeful headlines from the Journal's opinion pages. Historian Walter Russell Mead's op-ed "The Myth of America's Decline" argued that, while power has become dispersed among more global players (  <hyperlink>  China, India,  <hyperlink>  Brazil, Turkey, Japan and Europe), the United States remains the "Chairman of the Board" on most global matters.  <paragraph>  Next to Mead's article was an opinion page headline asking "Who Deserves Credit for the Improving Economy?"  Even though the article warns of a coming fiscal cliff in 2013, most incumbents would put this op-ed under the "Just-Spell-My-Name-Right" category.  <paragraph>  If opinion writers spend the next year haggling over who should get the credit for America's improving economy, Barack Obama will be a happy man and Republicans will start planning for 2014.
The message of Jesus |  <paragraph>  With the holiest week of the year coming to an end, now is a good time to reflect on the message of Jesus that has been twisted in knots by televangelists and politicians in our time.   <paragraph>  Jesus is not about getting rich. He's about feeding the poor.  <paragraph>  Jesus doesn't care about putting your favorite politician first. He cares about you putting yourself last.  <paragraph>  He doesn't want you to listen to self-righteous televangelists or self-promoting politicians. Instead, he wants you to read his words and learn the truth. And for the purposes of those who read this column, Jesus never focused on politics. He remained silent on gay marriage, liberation theology or abortion wars.  But he did command us to love others, forgive others and serve others.  <paragraph>  Then he told us we should love others more than we love ourselves, that we should love our enemies, that we must turn the other cheek, that the peacemakers are blessed and that we must focus more on our own sins instead of judging the faults of others.  <paragraph>  And when Jesus' disciples asked what they needed to do to get to Heaven, his answer was simple: care for the poor, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, give water to the thirsty, visit those in prison and bring hope to the hopeless.  <paragraph>  That is a radically different message than the one we hear from popular culture and misguided ministers. But that message contained in Matthew 25 remains the heart of the Son of God's message 2,000 years after he rose from the grave.  <paragraph>  That's also a message that sinners like myself must always remember and be challenged by every day.
From tea party to tepid |   <paragraph>  Absent a political earthquake, the GOP nomination outcome is set in stone. Willard Mitt Romney will be the Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012. And just as the red hot Republican Revolution of 1994 was followed by Bob Dole's ascension in 1996, the Tea Party Uprising of 2010 is being followed by the nomination of Obamacare's ideological architect.  <paragraph>  Regardless, the fat lady has sung. As conservative talker Hugh Hewitt declared on National Review Online last night, "The race for the GOP nomination is still over."  <paragraph>  University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato, writing for NRO's "The Corner" said this: <paragraph>  "Santorum has earned another run in 2016 or 2020. But it is three long weeks until the next set of primaries. He is guaranteed to lose four of five contests on that day, and he may even lose the delegate battle in Pennsylvania — a potentially crippling embarrassment for his future plans. Santorum has no real chance to stop Romney and may squander the admiration he has won in the GOP base.  <paragraph>  Too bad Mitt Romney's opponents are walking around like Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense." As former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford noted in a column for Fox News, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are not swayed by political logic or delegate math.  <paragraph>  "Mathematical certainties at this point mean nothing to Gingrich and have never meant anything to Santorum. If they did, Santorum would never have entered the race in the first place."  <paragraph>  As for Gingrich, the statement he released after last night's losses suggest the former speaker is planning to continue his fight all the way though Tampa.  <paragraph>  “Our party must commit itself to a bold, conservative platform. We cannot win on an etch-a-sketch platform that shows no principle or backbone.”  <paragraph>  And the beat goes on....
Let Mitt be Mitt... and dull |   <paragraph>  Mike Allen and Evan Thomas' "Inside the Circus" reveals that Mitt Romney's campaign team is still trying to figure out how to make their emotionally remote and fabulously wealthy candidate connect with voters.  <paragraph>  Team Romney has spent the past month or so trying to humanize their candidate with mostly disastrous results. Romney's poll numbers have taken a dive and his consistently poor performances have spooked conservatives like myself who can't believe this is the best the GOP has to offer after four years of Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Although he's a lousy politician, everyone who knows Mitt personally sees him as a great father, a devoted husband and a gifted businessman. If you spend a few minutes with the man's family, you can see his character shining through in his wife and five boys. But being a good man has not always translated well on the campaign trail. Perhaps this is because the business of politics is such an inhumane slog that only the craziest among us can look like normal human beings while going through the grind of a presidential election.  <paragraph>  Mitt can't fake it. He stinks at politicking. But then again, so did many others who would later succeed at governing. If Boston wants their candidate to humanize himself, maybe they should just let him admit that fact and stop trying to stuff himself into a suit that doesn't fit.  <paragraph>  So what should Mitt Romney tell Americans when he stops joking about his father shutting down plants or when he stops pretending to be a fan of "The Hunger Games"? Maybe he could start with the truth about himself.  <paragraph>  Mr. Romney should begin by talking about the proud legacy that his father passed along, the lessons he learned from a dad who began his life with little and ended up a legend in Michigan business and history.  <paragraph>  Then Mitt Romney should brag about starting a company that was wildly successful in turning businesses around, repairing failing companies and creating big profits for senior citizens, colleges, public unions, 401(k)s and anyone else smart enough to bet on Romney's company.  <paragraph>  Romney could then brag about leaving Wall Street to take on Teddy Kennedy in the Liberal Lion's own back yard. He should also admit to lurching a bit too much to the left while assuring conservatives that he will never make that mistake again.  <paragraph>  Team Romney should also remind voters that he saved the 2002 Olympics, not because he knew how to tell jokes or play "man of the people," but because Mitt Romney was born to fix things that are broken - like the U.S. economy in 2012. <paragraph>  Romney should then tell Americans how he was elected governor of one of the most liberal states in America despite being a conservative Mormon. Romney further succeeded politically when he managed to pull the Democratic legislature of Massachusetts as far right as politically possible. If President Romney is forced one day to govern with Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid, he can promise Americans that he will be more prepared to lead a divided nation than a certain former state legislator who voted present on the same kind of tough votes that required Governor Romney to build a majority.  <paragraph>  Mitt Romney should then just admit the sad truth. He's stiff. He's boring. He looks plain uncomfortable every time he tries to be cool. And despite what the love of his life may believe, he has never been the life of any party. But he may be the only leader on the national stage who has what it takes to fix an economy that's deep in debt, bleeding jobs by the year and suffering through 30 years of decline.  <paragraph>  Now is not the time to tell jokes. Now is the time to lead. So Mitt Romney, lead. And leave the bad jokes to Jay Leno.
Not conservative enough |   <paragraph>  In the  <hyperlink>  New York Times this Sunday, author Kevin Baker echoed the sentiment of most in the mainstream media that the Republican Party's biggest problem over the past few years has been a lurch to the right. When you judge the party by its bottom line, the fact is that the GOP has not been conservative enough.  <paragraph>  What is too conservative about spending the past decade doubling the national debt?   <paragraph>  How is an unpaid for $7 trillion Medicare expansion a run to the right?  <paragraph>  Will most historians look back on a party who promised to end tyranny across the globe, use American troops as the world's 9-1-1 and engage in nation building on an unprecedented level consider Bush Republicans too conservative or too Wilsonian? Don't waste your time answering. The verdict is obvious. <paragraph>  And for all the weeping and gnashing of teeth I have had to endure over the radicalism of this tea party Congress, to my worried liberal friends I say “take a valium and relax.” This right wing, radical, reactionary tea party crew has meekly gone along with their statist party leaders far too often for my tastes. As a result, they added $1 trillion to the national debt their first year in power and got outmaneuvered by President Barack Obama at every turn.  <paragraph>  Too many in the media (and the conservative movement) have been distracted by stupid statements that have been streaming out of a few Republicans' mouths instead of keeping their eyes on the bottom line. When you focus on the one issue that really matters -- individual freedom vs. state expansion -- the GOP fails every test on true, blue conservatism.   <paragraph>  And now the party is in the process of nominating the man who was the architect of Obama's health care law.   <paragraph>  Too conservative? Actually, not conservative enough.   <paragraph>  ( <video> See my video blog below on the topic)
Is Romney's fate Kristol clear? |  <paragraph>   While you were sleeping last night, most commentators called the GOP presidential fight for Methodical Mitt. Last night's win in Illinois was one of the cleaner victories for Team Romney though University of Virginia's Larry Sabato commented that it was "amusing to see pundits declare the Illinois primary a game-changer when it's the kind of state Romney should carry."    <paragraph>   Still, Sabato and others on National Review's Symposium posted early this morning concluded that the Republican race was all but over.    <paragraph>   Hugh Hewitt wrote that "unless a meteor hits the campaign bus, it is Obama vs. Romney in the fall, a race the former Massachusetts governor can win."    <paragraph>   The National Review's Jim Geraghty said "It's not quite over…but it's effectively over."    <paragraph>   Time Magazine's Mark Halperin called the race for Romney. And given an April calendar that favors Mitt and the fundraising shortcomings of the other candidates, Mark may be right.    <paragraph>   Still, hope springs eternal for those hoping for a conservative knight in shining armor to emerge from Tampa, though some of us are starting to sound like Japanese soldiers burrowed into Pacific islands ready to fight a battle whose outcome is already determined.    <paragraph>   But don't expect Bill Kristol to march meekly behind the Republican Party's flawed front runner.    <paragraph>   This morning, Kristol told readers why Mitt Romney may have won the battle but conservatives are likely to lose the political war this fall with Barack Obama.    <paragraph>   "Watching Mitt Romney's victory speech in Illinois didn't reassure me about his chances against President Obama. His victory seems likely (but still not inevitable!), But if he sticks with this core message, we'd better hope Republicans and independents are really determined to get rid of Barack Obama."    <paragraph>   Put me in the Kristol camp. Faced with the historic opportunity to retain the House, take the Senate, win the White House and reshape the Supreme Court for a generation, the Republican Party seems destined to nominate a candidate they do not even like.
Finding common ground on education reform | <paragraph>   The reaction to our education town hall meeting held this morning in Ft. Lee, N.J., has been overwhelmingly positive. It was great to talk about education reform in a state where Newark's Democratic mayor, New Jersey's Republican governor and the country's Democratic president all consider themselves on the same side of reform.    <paragraph>   This "dogs and cats living together" moment was made more evident when Gov. Chris Christie began saying nice things about Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy's education team. The fact that Christie and Malloy spent much of last year fighting each other in the press made their kind words about each other all the more hopeful today. Other "odd couples" who found common ground today were American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and Harlem Village Academies CEO Deborah Kenny, as well as former DNC chairman Howard Dean and former D.C. schools superintendent Michelle Rhee.    <paragraph>   Today's Morning Joe town hall meeting on education showed that reforming America's schools may be one political cause that brings all sides together. And judging from today's conversations on Morning Joe, the left and right are moving closer together every day.    <paragraph>   To see video from this morning's town hall, head to    <hyperlink>    joe.msnbc.com.    <paragraph>   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misspelled Deborah Kenny's name.
A reporter's notebook... |  <paragraph>   To better serve you, the dedicated POLITICO blog reader, I travel the globe regularly to grasp the challenges facing other countries in hopes of improving our own. Like Thomas Friedman, David Ignatius and Nick Kristof, I know the big story never lands on a newsroom desk. That is why this weekend, I went on assignment in the most trying of circumstances.  <paragraph>   After arriving at the Lanesborough Hotel in Knightsbridge, London, I dug right in to my assignment despite the challenging surroundings. After having to call the butler TWICE to get the right Visconti pen to begin this posting, I soon became bored at the thought of writing anything so I ordered "Old School" on TV and called it a night.    <paragraph>   The next morning I began my journalistic journey in earnest and began studying the current British economic crisis, Prime Minister Cameron's response to that crisis, and how the Chancellor of the Exchequer's austerity program has impacted disposable income -- specifically, among English scousers who are also soccer fans. From the outset of my trip, I had hoped to challenge the preposterous assumption (repeated by absolutely nobody that I know) that the British economy is so bad that even rabid fans from Northern England would fail to make this weekend's trip to Wembley to see Liverpool win the League Cup in glorious style.  <paragraph>   Happily, my brutish slog across the pond was rewarded by the accumulation of massive evidence that British pensioners continue to spend their money on life's basics -- kegs of Carlsberg, graphic tattoos and overpriced futbol tickets. I even considered, albeit briefly, leaving my luxury box to interview the teeming masses but thought the better of it. Instead, I picked up a paper on the way to Heathrow this morning and was surprised by how closely the     <hyperlink>    current British crisis parallels our own. <paragraph>   “ In a stark warning ahead of next month’s Budget, the Chancellor said there was little the Coalition could do to stimulate the economy.  <paragraph>   Mr. Osborne’s bleak assessment echoes that of Liam Byrne, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, who bluntly joked that Labour had left Britain broke when he exited the Government in 2010.  He left David Laws, his successor, a one-line note saying: “Dear Chief Secretary, I’m afraid to tell you there’s no money left.” <paragraph>   "The British Government has run out of money because all the money was spent in the good years,” the Chancellor said. “The money and the investment and the jobs need to come from the private sector.” ”   <paragraph>   Whoever wins the 2012 election will be faced with the same reality when they are sworn in the following January. But the question for historians is whether this global economic crisis will be solved by President Obama's trillion dollar deficits or by Prime Minister Cameron's austere approach.  <paragraph>   My money is on Cameron. But at this point in the crisis, politicians on both sides of the political divide -- and on both sides of the Atlantic -- are whistling past graveyards. As the famous Hollywood saying goes, "Nobody knows nothing."
The truth about entitlement spending | <paragraph>   If you want to know why Republicans and Democrats can't make progress on long-term deficit reduction, take a look at the segment below from Morning Joe. In our roundtable discussion, my good friend Jeffrey Sachs (I need to underline that point before you actually watch the segment) claims that entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not cause the national debt to balloon over the next generation.   <paragraph>   Despite my great respect for Dr. Sachs, the Columbia professor's math doesn't seem to add up. <paragraph>   Financier and former Obama Car Czar Steve Rattner came to play today with handy charts that show entitlement spending devouring 40% of federal spending in 2012. Within the decade, that number expands to 54%, and goes much higher in the out years. Steve also described a crowding out of federal investment in discretionary programs like education, R&D and infrastructure because of an ever-growing entitlement system fueled by an aging population and rising health care costs.  <paragraph>   Dr. Sachs did admit that entitlement spending was on a sharp upward trajectory but was unwilling to embrace the type of reforms that I believe will prevent the collapse of Medicare in the future.  <paragraph>   But progressives are not alone in their collective state of denial regarding Medicare. In one of the most depressing poll results registered over the past few years, self-described Tea Party members were surveyed last spring     <hyperlink>    in a Marist poll and asked if they supported Medicare spending reforms. A pathetic 70% said "no," proving once again that when it comes to entitlement programs, some Americans just don't want to hear the truth.   <paragraph>   But the truth is that Medicare and Medicaid are the biggest drivers of America's national debt over the next generation. And that is not a matter of ideology. That is a matter of math. <video>
Crunch time for Romney | <paragraph>   In case you missed the show today, please see the video below of our discussion regarding the current state of the GOP race. The Michigan primary is exactly two weeks away, and several new polls show it is officially crunch time for the Romney campaign. What seemed only weeks ago to be a foregone conclusion for the former Massachusetts governor is shaping up to be an epic battle.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    American Research Group - Santorum with a 7 point lead  <hyperlink>    Public Policy Polling - Santorum with a 15 point lead     <paragraph>   <video>
Statement by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski regarding Pat Buchanan |  <paragraph>   "Everyone at Morning Joe considers     <hyperlink>    Pat Buchanan to be a friend and a member of the family. Even though we strongly disagree with the contents of Pat's latest book, Mika and I believe those differences should have been debated in public. An open dialogue with     <hyperlink>    Morning Joe regulars like Al Sharpton and Harold Ford, Jr. could have developed into an important debate on the future of race relations in America.  <paragraph>   Because we believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant, Mika and I strongly disagree with this     <hyperlink>    outcome. We understand that the parting was amicable. Still, we will miss Pat."
Tell Scarborough: Where do you stand on Afghanistan? | <paragraph>   With Afghanistan on the front pages of America's papers this past weekend, Morning Joe     <hyperlink>    started the week discussing the latest tragedies from that war-torn country and the need to bring our troops home. Watch the discussion below and let me know what you think by emailing me at     <hyperlink>    joeblog@politico.com or sending your thoughts via Twitter (    <hyperlink>    @joenbc).  <paragraph>   <video>
My new POLITICO blog, all I ever needed | <paragraph>   Thanks so much for taking a look at my Politico blog. <paragraph>   Like Navin R. Johnson seeing his name in the phone book for the first time, I feel like this is the lucky break I've been waiting for all my life. My blog will delight you and your extended family with stories of European futbol matches that end in 0-0 ties, underground bands for whom neither you nor your friends have ever heard, and inspiring stories regaling the glories of my time in Congress 47 years ago.   <paragraph>   I will also do my best to let you know what's really happening behind the scenes in Congress, the White House and in the media world. I'll also write about the things that really matter the most to me -- like my ashtray, and these matches, and the remote control, and the paddle ball... and this lamp. That's all I need, is this lamp....and this blog.   <paragraph>   Best, Joe
