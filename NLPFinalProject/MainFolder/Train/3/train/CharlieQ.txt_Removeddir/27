NRCC still spending in Rhode Island. Really. |     <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Here’s a headline you don’t expect to see in heavily Democratic Rhode Island, 11 days out from Election Day: “National GOP to spend $280K on final TV push to oust Cicilline.”   <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    Ted Nesi’s report for WPRI: “Republicans have said for weeks they don’t believe the hype that Democratic Congressman David Cicilline is pulling away from GOP challenger Brendan Doherty. Now they’re putting their money where their mouths are. <paragraph>   The National Republican Congressional Committee confirmed Friday it will spend $280,000 on a final round of television commercials to air during the closing week of Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District race, enough to buy 1,000 gross rating points. The ads will air Oct. 30 to Nov. 6.”    <paragraph>   Given the state and the district’s Democratic orientation, the national GOP has typically checked out of Little Rhody by this time of year — if they paid attention at all. But the NRCC’s financial commitment at this late stage is a sign that Cicilline is an incumbent who remains in the danger zone.    <paragraph>   Cicilline, a freshman whose first term has been dogged by controversy surrounding statements he made about the fiscal health of Providence before he left the mayor’s office for Washington, is one of two New England Democrats facing uphill reelection challenges this year — the other is Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney.    <paragraph>   Suffice it to say, if Democrats aren’t able to hold House seats in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in a presidential election year, then there isn’t much hope of capturing a majority.    <paragraph>   UPDATE: Not to be outdone, the DCCC is     <hyperlink>    countering with a $315,000 ad buy for Cicilline, "placed just hours after the National Republican Congressional Committee revealed it will spend $280,000 on a final round of commercials to help Doherty."
