A GOP call for reform in Minnesota | <paragraph>  A critical part of the GOP’s path forward is a reexamining of process — in other words, looking closely at the institutional factors that are generating unelectable nominees.  <paragraph>  In Minnesota, where first-term Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar won a landslide victory over largely unknown Republican state Rep. Kurt Bills, former state GOP Executive Director Ben Golnik   <hyperlink>  calls for an end to the complicated candidate-endorsement process that helped deliver the nomination to Bills.  <paragraph>  “ For Republicans, the endorsing convention is composed of about 2,000 delegates from around the state. To win endorsement, a candidate must receive 60 percent of the vote. Essentially, 1,200 delegates pick the Republican candidate for statewide office. How were these 1,200 delegates selected? First, Republicans had to attend precinct caucuses on a Tuesday night in the dead of winter. These caucus meetings could last for a couple hours as attendees elect delegates to local conventions. The local conventions are held a few weeks after the precinct caucuses, typically on Saturdays, and last several hours. At these conventions, delegates to the state convention are elected. Finally, a state convention (with a $75 registration fee per delegate in 2012) is held on a Saturday in the late spring. Many delegates must travel hundreds of miles and pay for a couple of nights in a hotel. The actual endorsement process can last the entire day and late into the night until a candidate reaches the 60 percent threshold. This costly, time-consuming process discourages involvement from a broader group of Republicans. For families with young children, it requires money for babysitters. For small-business owners, it requires significant time away from their jobs. With the complicated process, a well-organized minority can defeat a poorly organized majority. At the Republican caucuses in February 2012, Ron Paul received about one-quarter of the votes cast. At the Republican state convention a few months later, Paul supporters represented more than half of the delegates. Bills, a teacher and first-term state representative, was selected by the ardent Paul supporters as the U.S. Senate candidate. As Republicans look to run serious challengers to Dayton and U.S. Sen. Al Franken in 2014, strong candidates must be recruited — from both inside the existing structure and from outside. Prospective candidates should skip the endorsement process and run in a primary, rather than focusing solely on the endorsement process. Credible candidates must be able to demonstrate an ability to raise money and communicate a message to a broader audience than 2,000 Republican delegates. ”  <paragraph>  Calls to reform the nominating process in states like Minnesota aren’t new, but it’s possible they’ll take on an increased urgency in the wake of two successive national election cycles marked by unusually weak Republican general election candidates.  <paragraph>  The problem, of course, is that pure primary elections aren’t a cure-all. Primaries have produced the most notorious GOP nominees of the past two cycles — the ones who essentially handed over seats to Democratic candidates.
