Three journalists subpoenaed by defense in CIA leak case | <paragraph>  Three journalists subpoenaed by the defense in the criminal case against of former Central Intelligence Agency officer John Kiriakou will fight efforts to force them to testify in the case, according to court filings and spokespeople for the news outlets involved.  <paragraph>  The journalists being pressed for testimony are Scott Shane of the New York Times, Julie Tate of the Washington Post and freelancer Matthew Cole, sources told POLITICO.  <paragraph>  The subpoenas seek to force Shane, Tate and Cole to attend depositions and answer defense questions, apparently about classified information related to the CIA's interrogation of alleged terrorists. Prosecutors have indicated they don't plan to call journalists as part of their case.  <paragraph>  Shane and Cole were mentioned in Kiriakou's indictment, though not by name, as recipients of classified information about the identities of CIA personnel involved in the spy agency's "Rendition, Detention and Interrogation" program.  <paragraph>  Tate, a Post researcher who worked on stories about the Guantanamo prisoners and helped develop a Post database of the inmates, was not mentioned in the indictment. However, Kiriakou's lawyers said in a court filing "information developed by Mr. Kiriakou's defense indicates that Researcher 1 [Tate] participated with Journalist A  [Cole] in certain activities alleged in the Indictment."  <paragraph>  A New York Times spokeswoman said the paper will fight the subpoena to Shane, whose reporting on interrogations was specifically cited in Kiriakou's indictment. "We generally oppose subpoenas that seek the testimony of our journalists and we plan to oppose this one," Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy wrote in an e-mail.  <paragraph>  A spokeswoman for the Post had no immediate comment, but a lawyer for the paper said Tate will seek to block the subpoena issued to her. "We plan to file a motion to quash the subpoena on behalf of Ms. Tate," Williams and Connolly attorney William Doffermyre said in an e-mail.  <paragraph>  Cole's lawyer, Mark Zaid, filed papers in federal court in Alexandria, Va. Thursday asking that the subpoena against his client be thrown out. Zaid said Cole is protected from testifying by the First Amendment and by a reporter's privilege. However, Zaid also said his client, if forced to appear, would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights because he faces a real threat of prosecution for revealing classified information at the deposition. (Cole's motion is posted   <hyperlink> here.)  <paragraph>  It's unclear precisely what information the defense is seeking from the journalists, but it may be seeking to demonstrate that some of the information the government contends it was making efforts to keep secret was in fact being circulated outside the government.  <paragraph>  Depositions are unusual in criminal cases but Kiriakou's defense team argues they are necessary because of special rules that apply to the use of classified national security information in court. The prosecution is   <hyperlink> opposing holding the depositions.  <paragraph>  Kiriakou is facing one charge of disclosing the identity of a covert officer, three counts of violating the Espionage Act by revealing closely-held national defense information, and one count of lying to the CIA's Publications Review Board.  <paragraph>  The press subpoenas were first reported Thursday by Steven Aftergood on the   <hyperlink> Federation of American Scientists's Secrecy News blog. However, Tate was identified in that account only as "Researcher 1," the way she is generically referred to in court papers. Shane's identity is evident from the indictment. Cole's link to the case was   <hyperlink> first reported on this blog in April.  <paragraph>  Defense lawyers   <hyperlink> indicated in July that they wanted to talk with journalists about the case, but there was no talk at that time of compelling witnesses to testify.  <paragraph>  It's unclear why the names of the journalists are being redacted from public court records. While unindicted third parties are not usually named in indictments, they are usually identified publicly in subsequent court filings.
