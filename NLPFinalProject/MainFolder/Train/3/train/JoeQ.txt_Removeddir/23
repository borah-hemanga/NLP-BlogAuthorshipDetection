Finding common ground on education reform | <paragraph>   The reaction to our education town hall meeting held this morning in Ft. Lee, N.J., has been overwhelmingly positive. It was great to talk about education reform in a state where Newark's Democratic mayor, New Jersey's Republican governor and the country's Democratic president all consider themselves on the same side of reform.    <paragraph>   This "dogs and cats living together" moment was made more evident when Gov. Chris Christie began saying nice things about Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy's education team. The fact that Christie and Malloy spent much of last year fighting each other in the press made their kind words about each other all the more hopeful today. Other "odd couples" who found common ground today were American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and Harlem Village Academies CEO Deborah Kenny, as well as former DNC chairman Howard Dean and former D.C. schools superintendent Michelle Rhee.    <paragraph>   Today's Morning Joe town hall meeting on education showed that reforming America's schools may be one political cause that brings all sides together. And judging from today's conversations on Morning Joe, the left and right are moving closer together every day.    <paragraph>   To see video from this morning's town hall, head to    <hyperlink>    joe.msnbc.com.    <paragraph>   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misspelled Deborah Kenny's name.
