Gay marriage, abortion and the independent voter |   <paragraph>  With apologies to ideologues of all parties, the latest Gallup poll on abortion shows just how pragmatic American voters can be when it comes to social issues.  <paragraph>  That may come as news to extreme special interest groups on both sides of the aisle. After all, these organizations have made a good living through the years by pushing their own brand of morality on American voters. These advocacy groups have also contributed to the toxic environment in Washington by simplifying every issue and demonizing every opponent.  <paragraph>  Few issues have divided Washington and America more than abortion and gay marriage. And yet Americans are now declaring independence from rigid agendas by heading in opposite ideological directions in these two heated debates.  <paragraph>  According to recent surveys, voters are becoming more progressive on gay marriage. The divide-and-conquer strategy that worked for Republicans in 2004 will never again be as effective as it was during George W. Bush's reelection campaign.  <paragraph>  At the same time, voters are becoming more conservative on abortion. The latest Gallup poll shows that 50 percent of Americans identify themselves as pro-life. That's a 17 point jump from when the same question was asked by Gallup in 1996. A record low 41 percent of Americans surveyed now identify themselves as pro-choice. That is a 15 point drop since 1996.  <paragraph>  Despite large swings in the way voters identify themselves on this issue, politicians should also take note that the majority of Americans tell pollsters they still believe abortion should be legal in some cases.  <paragraph>  So what does it mean? Perhaps that attitudes on abortion are changing, but not overnight. The same is true of gay marriage, as Team Obama learned earlier this month. Chicago privately concedes that President Obama is now more likely to lose the swing state of North Carolina because of his recent statement on gay marriage.  <paragraph>  Republicans are just as likely to lose suburban women and other swing voters if they dart too far right on abortion over the next six months. The GOP presidential primary campaign underlined that fact in bright red ink earlier this year.  <paragraph>  Still, attitudes are changing on both issues. And any politician who believes he can blindly follow a tired party line will soon find himself out of touch and out of office.
