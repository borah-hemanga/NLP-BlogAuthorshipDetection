NYT leads coverage on incoming CEO | The New York Times continues to provide in-depth reporting on the questions facing its incoming chief executive Mark Thompson over his role in the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal. <paragraph> In a Nov. 4 piece “As Scandal Flared, BBC’s Leaders Missed Red Flags <hyperlink> ,” the Times reported on Thompson’s history at BBC, his various statements regarding the spiked Savile investigation and the circumstances surrounding his hiring at the Times. The Times's investigation editor Matthew Purdy noted that the controversy surrounding the canceled “Newsnight” investigation “has shaken the solid reputation Mr. Thompson had when he left the BBC on Sept. 14.” <paragraph> “Interviews with former BBC executives and officials here in London show that in the months after the investigation was canceled, Mr. Thompson and his top executives repeatedly missed opportunities to pursue a fuller picture of the ‘Newsnight’ reporting, the fate of the program and, perhaps, of Mr. Savile,” the Times reported. <paragraph> “Whether through a series of near misses or a more deliberate avoidance, the executives failed to confront questions about Mr. Savile and the possibility that, in decades past, the BBC was somehow complicit in his behavior,” the Times added. <paragraph> The lengthy article also featured quotes from an interview with Thompson conducted last week. Thompson told the Times that he knew little, if anything, about the investigation. <paragraph> But, as the Times reported, “it was not for lack of opportunity.” After the investigation was spiked, there were seven articles in the British press about Savile and the canceled program, and former executives told the Times that some of those articles were in press clippings sent to top BBC executives and that Thompson’s daily morning conference call often featured discussions of the included clippings. Thompson told the Times he did not read all of the clippings and did not recall seeing those reports in any of the packets. <paragraph> Thompson, who is set to start work at the Times on Nov. 12, maintained that his public statements <hyperlink> on the matter have never changed. <paragraph> “I honestly believe I did nothing wrong,” he told the Times. <paragraph> And Media columnist Michael Wolff <hyperlink>  argues that the Times’ public editor, Margaret Sullivan, “largely deserves the credit for the brouhaha,” pointing to her call for the publication to “thoroughly” and aggressively report the story. <paragraph> “Thompson, in fact, will not have a journalism role at the Times; so, it is quite unclear how Sullivan's mandate reaches him,” Wolff wrote. “But her pointing to a guilt by association, of the Times with Thompson, and Thompson with the BBC, and the BBC with sex abuse, certainly seemed damning – albeit rather more in a New York Post than a New York Times manner.”
