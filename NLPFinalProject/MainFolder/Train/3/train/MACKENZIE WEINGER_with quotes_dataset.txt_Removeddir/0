Blitzer cameos in new Bond film 'Skyfall' | The name’s Blitzer. Wolf Blitzer. <paragraph> If you catch a screening of the new James Bond movie “Skyfall” this weekend, you’ll spot the CNN anchor making a brief cameo appearance early on in the film. Blitzer plays himself and delivers a crucial news report that spurs Bond into action on behalf of her Majesty's secret service. It's a small role, but crucial to driving the plot. <paragraph> “Daniel Craig, James Bond and Wolf Blitzer,” Blitzer said on Thursday’s show about his performance. “You’ll have to see it.” <paragraph> Blitzer asked his viewers to tweet him once they’d seen the film. <paragraph> “This acting thing, maybe I’ve got some potential,” he added. “You never know." <paragraph> He’s not the only CNN anchor with a movie out this month: Piers Morgan guests in the Denzel Washington movie “Flight,” which opened last Friday. Like Blitzer, the “Piers Morgan Tonight” anchor plays himself. Morgan tweeted on Thursday <hyperlink>about what he dubbed CNN’s “thespian war.” <paragraph> “So, I'm in the new Denzel movie #Flight and @wolfblitzer 's in the new Bond movie #Skyfall - both out this week. This is... #CNNthespianwar,” Morgan wrote. <paragraph> CNN did not have any additional comment.
