Calif. props price tag: $351 million | <paragraph>   <picture>    <paragraph>   While there’s no action at the presidential level in California, where President Barack Obama is poised to win by a comfortable margin, the nation’s largest state is still weathering an avalanche of campaign spending.    <paragraph>   The main driver? The 11 statewide ballot propositions.    <paragraph>   A new     <hyperlink>    MapLight analysis of campaign finance data through Oct. 25 reports that $351 million has been raised by the campaigns for and against the ballot measures.    <paragraph>   The bulk of that staggering total is in just three propositions: two measures that raise taxes (Propositions 30 and 38) and Proposition 32, which would ban unions and corporations from using automatic paycheck deductions to raise money for political purposes.    <paragraph>   At least $128 million has been raised for Prop 32, powered by $68.8 million in pro-labor money.    <paragraph>   The MapLight research reveals some fascinating nuggets, including the extent to which just a few mega-donors and special interests are     <hyperlink>    bankrolling the measures. But what’s equally interesting about the totals is that they serve as a reminder of the exorbitant costs of campaigning in California.    <paragraph>   The state hasn’t been competitive at the presidential level for a quarter-century but if it was, given the price tag of competing there, it would have a dramatic effect on the business of running for president, forcing a wholesale rethinking of strategy, tactics and fundraising practices.
