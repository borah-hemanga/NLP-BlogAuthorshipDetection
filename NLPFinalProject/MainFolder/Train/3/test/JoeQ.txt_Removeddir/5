Not conservative enough |   <paragraph>  In the  <hyperlink>  New York Times this Sunday, author Kevin Baker echoed the sentiment of most in the mainstream media that the Republican Party's biggest problem over the past few years has been a lurch to the right. When you judge the party by its bottom line, the fact is that the GOP has not been conservative enough.  <paragraph>  What is too conservative about spending the past decade doubling the national debt?   <paragraph>  How is an unpaid for $7 trillion Medicare expansion a run to the right?  <paragraph>  Will most historians look back on a party who promised to end tyranny across the globe, use American troops as the world's 9-1-1 and engage in nation building on an unprecedented level consider Bush Republicans too conservative or too Wilsonian? Don't waste your time answering. The verdict is obvious. <paragraph>  And for all the weeping and gnashing of teeth I have had to endure over the radicalism of this tea party Congress, to my worried liberal friends I say “take a valium and relax.” This right wing, radical, reactionary tea party crew has meekly gone along with their statist party leaders far too often for my tastes. As a result, they added $1 trillion to the national debt their first year in power and got outmaneuvered by President Barack Obama at every turn.  <paragraph>  Too many in the media (and the conservative movement) have been distracted by stupid statements that have been streaming out of a few Republicans' mouths instead of keeping their eyes on the bottom line. When you focus on the one issue that really matters -- individual freedom vs. state expansion -- the GOP fails every test on true, blue conservatism.   <paragraph>  And now the party is in the process of nominating the man who was the architect of Obama's health care law.   <paragraph>  Too conservative? Actually, not conservative enough.   <paragraph>  ( <video> See my video blog below on the topic)
