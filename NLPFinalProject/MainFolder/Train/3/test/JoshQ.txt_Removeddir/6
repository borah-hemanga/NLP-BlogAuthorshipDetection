White House: anti-Islam film 'truly abhorrent' |  <paragraph>  A top White House official has blasted as "truly abhorrent" the anti-Islam film that appears to have triggered an outpouring of violence against U.S. diplomatic posts in Egypt and Libya.  <paragraph>  Speaking to an international religious freedom conference in Washington on Wednesday, Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough endorsed efforts to create "a world where the dignity of all people — and all faiths — is respected."  <paragraph>  According to his prepared remarks released by the White House, he then added: "This work takes on added urgency given the truly abhorrent video that has offended so many people — Muslims, and non-Muslims alike — in our country and around the world."  <paragraph>  President Barack Obama's criticism earlier Wednesday of the "Innocence of Muslims" film, or film trailer in question, was a bit more reserved.  <paragraph>  In an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes," Obama said: "This film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that."  <paragraph>  And in a statement in the Rose Garden on Wednesday morning, Obama said in an apparent reference to the video: "We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others."  <paragraph>  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also described the video as "inflammatory."  <paragraph>  GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has not, thus far, criticized the video. He has faulted the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and the Obama administration for statements he that said sympathized with those attacking U.S. embassies because of the film. Romney charged Wednesday that the initial statements were "effectively apologizing for the right of free speech."  <paragraph>  In his remarks Wednesday, McDonough also condemned the violence that apparently led to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and at least three other Americans in Libya.  <paragraph>  The conference where McDonough spoke was sponsored by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, an organization that has been sharply at odds with the Obama White House over its efforts to force religiously affiliated hospitals and universities to cover birth control costs for their insured employees.  <paragraph>  Later in his remarks, McDonough — an observant Catholic — referred to Obama as a "brother in Christ" and said "faith has been a guiding force in [Obama's] own life."
