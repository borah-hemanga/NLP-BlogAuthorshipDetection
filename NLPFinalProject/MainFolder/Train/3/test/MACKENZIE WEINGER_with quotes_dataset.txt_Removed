What's the quickest way to Canada? | <video> It’s the age-old election threat: I’ll move to Canada if my candidate loses. <paragraph> Well, on Wednesday morning, FOX23’s traffic reporter Jeff Brucculeri made that promise a little easier for Tulsa residents to fulfill by offering viewers the best route to get to our northern neighbors. <paragraph> “We had some folks make a special request. I know a lot people said that if their candidate lost the election, they’d be moving to Canada — not sure why, but that was some of the folks’ promises out there. So let me give you the quickest and direct-est route to Canada from Tulsa,” he said during the “Beat The Traffic” segment on Tulsa, Oklahoma's FOX23. <paragraph> Brucculeri recommended taking Highway 75 northbound, up through Kansas. “When you get into Omaha, watch for that junction for Interstate 29, because then you want to take I-29,” he said. “Literally, I-29 will go to the Canadian border.” <paragraph> The newsroom erupted with laughter off-screen, but Brucculeri soldiered on with his directions. <paragraph> “They’re laughing at me. Now, when you get to Canada — this is serious stuff,” he said. “When you get to Canada, you’re going to hit the border here, make sure you got either your card or your passport, okay, to get into Canada, now. Then you’re going to get back on what is known as Highway 75 in Canada, or it’s actually the Lord Selkirk Highway. If you’re moving to Canada, you’re going to need to know this. Lord Selkirk Highway, okay?"
Bill O'Reilly: 'The white establishment is now the minority' | <video>  Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly said tonight that if President Barack Obama wins re-election, it’s because the demographics of the country have changed and “it’s not a traditional America anymore.” <paragraph> “The white establishment is now the minority,” O'Reilly said. “And the voters, many of them, feel that the economic system is stacked against them and they want stuff. You are going to see a tremendous Hispanic vote for President Obama. Overwhelming black vote for President Obama. And women will probably break President Obama's way. People feel that they are entitled to things and which candidate, between the two, is going to give them things?” <paragraph> “The demographics are changing,” he said. “It’s not a traditional America anymore.” <paragraph> (See also: 2012 election results map)  <hyperlink> <paragraph> O’Reilly said 50 percent of the voting public are people who “want stuff. They want things. And who is going to give them things? President Obama. He knows it, and he ran on it.” <paragraph> Twenty years ago, an establishment candidate like Mitt Romney would have trounced Obama, O’Reilly said. <paragraph> O’Reilly also criticized Romney for his response to Hurricane Sandy and said his campaign took “no chances” in recent days. <paragraph> “[Hurricane Sandy] just wiped the governor’s campaign off the map for five days. Five days Mitt Romney disappeared from the national debate and from the media headline,” O’Reilly said. “Now, it's interesting, because I told their campaign, and this is not self-aggrandizement, but I was speaking to some of the Romney people and I said do you have any idea that you are now invisible? Alright, no one is paying attention to you.” <paragraph> (PHOTOS: Election Day 2012)  <hyperlink> <paragraph> Obama, on the other hand, was seen out there trying to help victims, O’Reilly said. <paragraph> “I don't think that registered on the Romney people. But, in the exit polls tonight, that is a factor that President Obama looked bipartisan and presidential during that storm,” he said. <paragraph> And the Romney campaign coasted far too much on his debate performances in these last days, he added. <paragraph> “The strategy was we did better than we thought we were going to do in the debates. We're going to roll that into election day and take no chances,” O’Reilly said. “And that's exactly what the Romney campaign did. They took no chances. They didn't go on talk radio. They didn't go on national programs outside of football game interviews which mean nothing. They thought that they did well enough in the debates to roll in. And, you know what? They were right, except for Hurricane Sandy.”
MSNBC's Alex Witt rips Judd Gregg for bailing on interview | MSNBC’s Alex Witt told viewers Saturday that Judd Gregg ditched their planned interview when the network decided to show part of President Barack Obama’s speech live because he "didn’t want to listen to the president and wait through the duration." <paragraph> The host teased an interview with Gregg during her show “Weekends with Alex Witt,” saying that the former New Hampshire Republican senator and governor would join her shortly to discuss avoiding the fiscal cliff. <paragraph> “Will Republicans work with the president if he is re-elected? That interview is coming up in just a few minutes,” she said. <paragraph> Witt then ran through some top news stories and cut to a reporter covering the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York City. After the segment wrapped, the show went to commercial, and on its return, played about five minutes of Obama’s speech live. As MSNBC cut from the speech back to Witt, she announced Gregg had bailed on the show. <paragraph> “I wanted to let all of you know that we had teased the fact that former Republican senator and governor from New Hampshire Judd Gregg was going to speak with us,” she said. “I would like to let you know that he declined to stick around. He was plugged in, ready to go and he said he didn't want to listen to the president and wait through the duration to wait and speak with us.” <paragraph> "What just brings to mind for me is the possibility of spirit of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill when you have those kinds of sentiments being shared," she added. <paragraph> 
Steve Coll joins Pulitzer Prize Board | New Yorker writer Steve Coll, Miami Herald executive editor Aminda “Mindy” Marqués Gonzalez and playwright Quiara Alegría Hudes have been elected to the Pulitzer Prize Board, Columbia University announced Tuesday. <paragraph> Coll, who has written seven books, joined the New Yorker in 2005 after 20 years with The Washington Post. He is a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize — he first won in 1990, for Explanatory Reporting, for a series of articles with David A. Vise about the Securities and Exchange Commission and again in 2005, this time for General Nonfiction for his book “Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the C.I.A., Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, From the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001.” Marqués Gonzalez serves as the vice president and executive editor of The Miami Herald. She started her journalism career as an intern at The Herald and has spent her journalism career — save for a five-year stint as Miami bureau chief for People magazine — at the paper as a reporter and editor. <paragraph> Hudes won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2012 for “Water by the Spoonful.” <paragraph>  There are 19 members of the board, which is made up of journalists and news executives, as well as five academics or people involved in the arts. The chair rotates annually and voting members can serve a maximum of nine years.  
NYT public editor: Silver bet 'bad idea' | The New York Times' public editor Margaret Sullivan says Nate Silver's offer to bet on the winner of the presidential election was a “bad idea” that gives “ammunition to the critics” who want to paint him as a partisan. <paragraph>  Silver, the Times’ political statistician, bet MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough  <hyperlink> $1,000 — and then $2,000 — that President Barack Obama would win the election. Sullivan blasted the wager in an afternoon column headlined "Under Attack, Nate Silver Picks the Wrong Defense <hyperlink> ." <paragraph>  “But whatever the motivation behind it, the wager offer is a bad idea – giving ammunition to the critics who want to paint Mr. Silver as a partisan who is trying to sway the outcome,” Sullivan wrote. “It’s also inappropriate for a Times journalist, which is how Mr. Silver is seen by the public even though he’s not a regular staff member. <paragraph>  Silver, who spoke with Sullivan by phone Thursday, said the wager is “half playful and half serious.” <paragraph>  “He’s been on a rant, calling me an idiot and a partisan, so I’m asking him to put some integrity behind it,” he told Sullivan. “I don’t stand to gain anything from it; it’s for charity.” <paragraph>  That’s not how Sullivan sees it: the move was "inappropriate for a Times journalist, which is how Mr. Silver is seen by the public even though he’s not a regular staff member," she writes. Times’ associate managing editor for standards Philip Corbett told Sullivan that “I wouldn’t want to see it become newsroom practice.” <paragraph> Sullivan added that when Silver — “probably” the Times’ “most high-profile writer at this particular moment”— came to work at the paper, he “gained a lot more visibility and the credibility associated with a prominent institution.” <paragraph> “But he lost something, too: the right to act like a free agent with responsibilities to nobody’s standards but his own,” she wrote.   
NYT CEO addresses BBC sex abuse scandal | Mark Thompson — the incoming president and CEO of The New York Times Company who is currently facing questions about what he knew of the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse investigation — gave an interview to the paper Tuesday saying that "there is nothing to suggest that I acted inappropriately in the handling of this matter."  <paragraph>  Earlier on Tuesday, The New York Times’ public editor Margaret Sullivan  <hyperlink>  called for the publication to “thoroughly” and aggressively report the story surrounding the BBC “Newsnight” program about Savile that was killed last year while Thompson served as BBC director general. “The Times might start by publishing an in-depth interview with Mr. Thompson exploring what exactly he knew, and when, about what happened at the BBC,” she wrote.  <paragraph>  Thompson, who is scheduled to start his new job on Nov. 12, sat down for an interview at the Times building Tuesday <hyperlink>  with reporters Christine Haughney and David Carr and said he was not involved in canceling the investigation. <paragraph>  “I talked to senior management in BBC News and reported the conversation I had at the party and asked was there a problem,” he told the Times, noting that he was informed the story was dropped “for journalistic reasons.” <paragraph> “There is nothing to suggest that I acted inappropriately in the handling of this matter. I did not impede or stop the ‘Newsnight’ investigation, nor have I done anything else that could be construed as untoward or unreasonable,” he added. <paragraph> In her post, Sullivan asked, “How likely is it that he knew nothing? A director general of a giant media company is something like a newspaper’s publisher. Would a publisher be very likely to know if an investigation of one of its own people on sexual abuse charges had been killed? The answer to that is not as easy as it sounds.” <paragraph> Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Reuters interviewed Thompson about the Times' support of him in the wake of the scandal.   <paragraph>  “I do not believe there is anything that I've done in relation to this matter which should in anyway impinge on my abilities to fully discharge the responsibilities I'll have at the New York Times," he told Reuters <hyperlink> .  "All of my colleagues here in the management team of the New York Times have been very supportive on this and more broadly as I prepare to take on the job," he said. "I've been very well supported as the incoming CEO of this company." <paragraph>  As for Thompson’s other public statements on the investigation, on Oct. 13 he told the Times <hyperlink> , "I was not notified or briefed about the Newsnight investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation.” Thompson added in his statement that “during my time as director general of the BBC, I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile." But, as The Guardian noted <hyperlink> , Thompson’s spokesman told the London-based Times that the first time the former BBC director general heard about the investigation was at a party in late 2011 from a journalist. The journalist said words to the effect that 'You must be worried about the Newsnight investigation,’” the spokesman said, according to the Guardian. "This was the first that Mark had heard about the investigation. The journalist did not go into what Newsnight was investigating. Mark did not respond at the party but did mention the conversation to senior colleagues in BBC News and asked if there was a problem with the investigation. He was told that Newsnight had begun an investigation into Savile but had decided to drop it for journalistic reasons.” <paragraph>   The spokesman told the Guardian there was “no contradiction” between the two statements. "Mark told the New York Times he was not briefed on the Newsnight investigation. He wasn't. As he made clear yesterday he was only made aware of the allegations relating to Jimmy Savile when ITV published pre-broadcast publicity regarding their documentary in recent weeks," the spokesman said. <paragraph> Thompson was at the BBC from 2004 to Sept. 2012.  
Seattle Times Co. buys full-page campaign ad | The Seattle Times Co. purchased a full-page ad in Wednesday’s newspaper supporting Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna. <paragraph>  The ad is part of an independent-expenditure campaign with no coordination between the paper and the campaign, according to a statement from The Seattle Times. The ad appears on page B6 and says McKenna is a “choice that will make us all proud” and praises the candidate’s time as Washington state’s attorney general. The advertisement states that “no candidate authorized this ad. It is paid for by The Seattle Times Company.” <paragraph>  The point of the ad, according to the company's press release? It's all part of an attempt to convince political campaigns of just how valuable advertising in The Times could be. <paragraph>  “In recent years, political consultants have not been placing many campaign ads in The Seattle Times, and we think they’re missing out on the most effective way to reach voters in the Puget Sound region,” said Alan Fisco, executive vice president, revenue and new products for The Seattle Times said in a statement.  “We decided to try to tap into this important source of advertising revenue by demonstrating how effective advertising with The Times can be.” <paragraph>  The company will also run a similar campaign supporting Referendum 74, which would legalize same-sex marriage. Fisco said that the two campaigns are a "a business decision that is completely separate from journalism functions of the newspaper. The ads will be clearly identified as ads and there is no intersection between the advertising and our editorial commentary or news reporting." <paragraph>   Seattle Times executive editor David Boardman told The Seattle Times’ Jim Brunner in an email that “the News Department was not part of the discussion or the decision to do this," according to Brunner's blog post. <paragraph>  The press release states that "in formulating the advertising initiative, The Times decided to feature one statewide candidate and one statewide issue for which polling showed to be fairly close races" and the races were chosen because the Times had editorialized in support of each one. <paragraph> Jay Inslee spokesperson Sterling Clifford blasted the decision to run the ad, telling POLITICO that “all Washingtonians should be disappointed that the state's largest newspaper has chosen to sacrifice its credibility as an independent news source.” <paragraph>  McKenna’s campaign has yet to return a request for comment. <paragraph> The Seattle Times editorial board endorsed McKenna <hyperlink>  and the same-sex marriage referendum.  UPDATE (4:20 p.m.) <paragraph>   The Seattle Times' spokesperson Jill Mackie told POLITICO that the paper's "editorial page editor and executive (news) editor were briefed as a heads up on the concept after the decision to proceed was made." <paragraph>  The McKenna ad "effort is scheduled to run at a value of just over $75,000 between today and the election. A similar value in in-kind space will be donated to the R74 (Marriage Equality) campaign," Mackie wrote in an e-mail.
