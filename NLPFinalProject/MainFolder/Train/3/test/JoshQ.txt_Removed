Broadwell spoke of access to classified info |   <paragraph>  <video>  <paragraph>  Paula Broadwell, the author, military reservist and West Point graduate who reportedly had an extramarital affair with former CIA director David Petraeus, told an audience this summer that she routinely had access to classified information while researching a book on Petraeus's work as the commanding general in Afghanistan.  <paragraph>  During a panel discussion, Broadwell said her background  in the military and her continuing obligations as a major in the Army Reserve made her particularly careful not to disclose sensitive information she was privy to while an "embed" in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011.  <paragraph>  "I was entrusted with this opportunity to sit in on high level meetings with General Petraeus. Sitting in on SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility] meetings in the morning, listen to classified chatter of terrorist talk and so forth. And I had that background anyhow, so I knew a lot of that information for my writing, but I knew there was a clear line that I couldn’t cross when I was writing it out," Broadwell said in   <hyperlink> the July 2012 discussion at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Paula Broadwell in media spotlight)  <paragraph>  Broadwell acknowledged that her connection to the military and her role as a writer sometimes caused confusion among military personnel she encountered while working on the book.  <paragraph>  "I was embedded with Gen. Petraeus in Afghanistan and it was a little confusing for some of the folks there because I’m also a military reservist with a top secret/SCI clearance and then some. So, a lot of my former peers didn’t know how to treat me. Was I journalist Broadwell or was I Major Broadwell?" she recalled. "I had to follow very clear lines of non-disclosure and signed non-disclosure agreements like my colleagues. I felt like I was almost held to a higher level of accountability because I could lose my clearance."  <paragraph>  Broadwell's access to classified information has drawn scrutiny in the wake of reports that investigators found classified records on her computer and that a whistleblower approached House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) recently to express concern that a relationship Petraeus had may have led to classified information being compromised. The discovery of the classified information on Broadwell's computer was   <hyperlink> reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The involvement of Cantor, whose staff said the information was immediately passed on to the FBI, was   <hyperlink> disclosed Saturday by the New York Times.  <paragraph>  Other news reports have also raised questions about Broadwell's access to classified information, including details related to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in September.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Critics question Petraeus's timing)  <paragraph>  In a speech last month at the University of Denver, Broadwell said that the CIA at one point was holding prisoners at an annex near the consulate, and that the assault may have been an effort to free those prisoners. "I don't know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually—had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. So, that's still being vetted," she said, according to a video of the Denver event posted online and first   <hyperlink> reported by the Israeli media outlet Arutz Sheva.  <paragraph>  Later in her remarks, Broadwell, said some of her information had come from a Fox News report.  <hyperlink> Fox said Monday that it's "original" Oct. 26 report did mention three Libyan militia members being turned over by the CIA to Libyan authorities. That detail   <hyperlink> does not appear in the version of the story now posted online, but Fox reporter Jennifer Griffin did include it in at least one report.  <paragraph>  "We're also told, those at the CIA annex took into custody three Libyan attackers and were forced to hand them over to the Libyan February 17th forces that came to help at the annex approximately 4:00 in the morning. They handed these three Libyans over. It is not clear from U.S. officials what happened to the libyans and whether those Libyan attackers were in fact released in in the end by the Libyans," Griffin reported.  <paragraph>  The CIA has denied holding any prisoners at Benghazi and has vigorously disputed other aspects of Griffin's report, but it's not clear Broadwell said anything in Denver that was not previously reported by Fox. (Griffin first issued her report at about 11 A.M. Eastern Time that day. Broadwell, per  <hyperlink> a D.U. schedule, spoke after 7 P.M. Mountain Time.)  <paragraph>  At the Aspen conference in July, panel moderator Clark Bell of the McCormick Foundation said "certain elements" of Broadwell's book, "All In: The Education of David Petraeus," underwent a pre-publication security review to scrub it of classified information.  <paragraph>  Journalists embedded with the military often have access to some classified information. The practice falls into a kind of gray area. Many embed assignments would be hard to undertake without knowing some sensitive information about tactics and upcoming operations. But, journalists don't have security clearances and are not subject to background investigations.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: 10 fast facts about Gen. Petraeus)  <paragraph>  In any event, Broadwell said she did not consider herself a journalist. In her remarks to the security professionals, journalists and government contractors at the Aspen event, she repeatedly used language that stressed how familiar she was with secret matters. During her relatively brief comments, she spoke of working for a Joint Terrorism Task Force, of her top secret clearance "and then some," and of familiarity with "Five Eyes" efforts—lingo for U.S. Government intelligence information shared only with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.  <paragraph>  While Broadwell stressed the access she had, she also said she was especially vigilant to not disclose any classified information because it would have been a breach of trust between her and Petraeus, whom she described as a mentor. <paragraph>  "Sometimes, obviously, the government just cant disclose sources and methods and so forth," she said. "That was just reinforced when I had access to everything, it was my responsibility not to leak it—not to violate my mentor, if you will. I was writing about a very close mentor."  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Monday, 1:45 P.M.): An earlier version of this post said Fox News did not appear to have reported that prisoners were taken by the CIA in Benghazi. Fox says it did report something similar to that on Oct. 26.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Monday, 2:02 P.M.) We've located the original Fox quote and posted it above.
Romney dusts off Jobs Council attack |  <paragraph>  GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney went after President Barack Obama on Friday for long-term neglect of his jobs council, dusting off an attack Romney mounted aggressively in July but later largely dropped from his campaign rhetoric.  <paragraph>  Obama "put together a jobs council. These were people he picked from industries around the country. He brought them in to give him advice as to how to create jobs. Do you know how long it’s been since he met with the jobs council? Nine months! Can you imagine that? Nine months!" Romney said during a stop at a mining equipment factory in Etna, Ohio. "Let me tell you: well, first of all, I like business and I’m going to have a lot of people offering advice but I know a good deal about it myself to begin with. And that’ll help being president.”  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> POLITICO reported in July that the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness had not held an official meeting in six months and had not met with Obama during that time. Following the report, both Romney and the Republican Party   <hyperlink> unleashed a fusillade of attacks on Obama, arguing that his apparent neglect of the panel was symbolic of his failure to craft policies to spur job creation.  <paragraph>  However, Romney hasn't said much, if anything, about the Jobs Council since. It was not mentioned in any of his three debates with Obama. The GOP candidate may have dialed back the criticism because some who served on the panel are Republicans or conservatives and an attack on Obama for not meeting with the panel is hard to distinguish with an attack on the panel itself for failing to meet. (One prominent Jobs Council member, Intel CEO Paul Otellini, endorsed Romney earlier this week.)  <paragraph>  A White House spokesman suggested in July that Obama had been too busy to meet with the panel in recent months, saying the president had "a lot on his plate." However, sources familiar with the council said an in-person meeting was likely being avoided because the business leaders on the panel felt awkward appearing with Obama in the midst of a presidential election. Rifts had also developed between the CEOs and the few labor leaders in the group.  <paragraph>  In   <hyperlink> a follow-up story in August, POLITICO noted that the council has held monthly, private telephone calls to discuss its recommendations with Obama Administration officials—a practice which disturbs transparency advocates. The last event of any kind   <hyperlink> noted on the Council's website was in June.  <paragraph>  White House officials say the panel's recommendations have been in large part adopted by the administration, though some require action by Congress. However, Romney is correct that the last official council meeting was more than nine months ago, on Jan. 17, 2012.  <paragraph>  The Obama campaign did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Romney's renewed critique. —James Hohmann contributed to this post.
George McGovern, contrarian |  <paragraph>  While some of the obituaries published Sunday for the late Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) claim he was an unwavering, unabashed champion of the liberal left, he sometimes strayed from liberal orthodoxy, particularly after he left politics.  <paragraph>  In 1992, McGovern, who had purchased a small inn and restaurant in Connecticut, came out for tort reform.  <paragraph>  "Despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone else. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is frightening," McGovern wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (non-paywalled text   <hyperlink> here.)  <paragraph>  And in 2008, McGovern denounced so-called card-check legislation pushed by large labor unions and endorsed by almost everyone in the Democratic Party establishment.  <paragraph>  "Workers in developing countries such as Mexico insist on the secret ballot when voting as to whether or not their workplaces should have a union," McGovern wrote, again on the Wall Street Journal's op-ed page (excerpts   <hyperlink> here). "We should have no less for employees in our country."  <paragraph>  That fall, McGovern went so far as to tape a 60-second TV ad for opponents of the labor-backed card check measure, known as the Employee Free Choice Act.  <paragraph>  "It's hard to believe that any politician would agree to a law denying millions of employees the right to a private vote," McGovern said in   <hyperlink> the TV spot. "This proposed law cannot be justified. Working families deserve a voice and a private vote. I'm Sen. George McGovern and I approved this message because democracy is something that should never be sacrificed."
DOJ: No role for courts in Fast and Furious contempt fight |  <paragraph>  The federal courts have no authority to intervene in the dispute that led to President Barack Obama asserting executive privilege for the first time in the context of a Congressional inquiry, the Justice Department argued in a legal brief filed Monday night.  <paragraph>  Soon after that assertion of privilege in June, the House voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents related to a House probe of the Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal.  <paragraph>  The Justice Department brief (posted   <hyperlink> here) argues that the executive branch's decision not to comply with such subpoenas or portions thereof cannot be second-guessed or rejected by the judiciary—a sweeping claim of executive power that aligns the Obama administration with the stance President George W. Bush's administration took in a similar dispute in 2008.  <paragraph>  "An assumption of jurisdiction here would short-circuit the constitutional design and threaten to alter permanently the relationship among the Branches," Justice Department lawyers contend in the 46-page brief, arguing that Congress has many other avenues open to it to try to force compliance with the subpoena. "Filing suit is far easier than mustering the votes necessary to cut appropriations, defeat legislation, or override a veto, and is far less visible to constituents. A decision allowing the case to proceed would thus greatly diminish the political costs of inter-Branch confrontation and reduce the incentive for Congress to evaluate and prioritize the demands of its myriad committees."  <paragraph>  The brief notes at length the extensive back-and-forth between the Justice Department and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee over documents related to the panel's probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operation that reportedly allowed as many as 2000 firearms to flow from legal U.S. gun dealers to narcotraffickers in Mexico.  <paragraph>  One of the resolutions of contempt voted against Holder in June authorized the filing of a lawsuit to enforce the committee's subpoena. The panel   <hyperlink> filed such a suit in July in U.S. District Court in Washington.  <paragraph>  "This Court should not permit the Committee to circumvent this historical—and in this case, fruitful—process of negotiation and accommodation by seeking resolution of this inherently political dispute in federal court," the Justice Department argues in the new brief.  <paragraph>  The brief asserts that stepping into the Fast and Furious subpoena dispute would start down a slippery slope that could upend separation of powers by involving the courts in a wide array of disagreements between Congress and the Executive Branch.  <paragraph>  "If a committee of Congress could sue the Executive Branch on the basis of a claimed loss of power in a political dispute, then there would be little question that the President or subordinate officials of the Executive Branch would be entitled to bring political disputes with Congress into the judicial forum....Thus, the Judiciary would become the final arbiter of any political dispute between the Branches—or even one between officials of the same Branch—a result that is contrary to our constitutional scheme," the Justice Department lawyers write.  <paragraph>  "A court would have to weigh the relative interests of the political Branches and decide which interest prevails, either by elevating one over the other on a categorical basis or by enmeshing the court in the minutiae of the dispute between the Branches. Such an unmoored weighing of the interests of the political Branches is one the courts are ill-equipped to make," the brief continues.  <paragraph>  The brief also notes repeatedly that thousands of documents related to the gun operation itself have been turned over to Congress. The present dispute pertains to documents that indicate how the Justice Department and others in the federal government responded to Congressional and media inquiries about the matter.  <paragraph>  Unsurprisingly, the Justice Department brief argues that legal precedent favors the courts staying out of such fights. However, the brief acknowledges that just four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge John Bates ruled that the courts did have authority to force Bush White House officials, including White House Counsel Harriet Miers, to respond to subpoenas from a House committee investigating the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys. <paragraph>  The Miers decision "went down the wrong path, and there have now been more congressional suits challenging executive privilege in the past five years (two) than in the previous 220 years combined. This Court should reject the rash call for judicial intervention here, lest the constitutionally-sanctioned and time-honored process of negotiation and accommodation itself becomes a thing of the past," the Justice Department lawyers argue.  <paragraph>  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stayed Bates's ruling pending an appeal, but the case was resolved without a definitive appellate ruling in the early weeks of the Obama administration. <paragraph>  The committee's suit against Holder has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who was appointed to the bench by Obama last year. Due to the briefing schedule in the case, no ruling is expected until well after the election.
Iran unrest could undercut Romney critique |  <paragraph>  Reports of violent clashes in Iran due to the precipitous drop in value of the country's currency could upset GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's efforts to paint President Barack Obama's Iran policy as ineffectual.  <paragraph>  Tehran's central bazaar was reported to have been closed Wednesday and riot police were patrolling the streets as public and merchant frustration boiled over, apparently directed at economic woes caused by international sanctions intensified by the Obama Administration. At least one protest against Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad Wednesday was broken up by tear gas, news agencies reported.  <paragraph>  "Photos showed riot police blocking a street with the charred hulks of a garbage can and a motorcycle that had been set on fire. Smoke was rising from the area in central Tehran near the main bazaar,"  <hyperlink> the Associated Press reported. <paragraph>  "Hundreds of police in anti-riot gear stormed the currency exchange district of Ferdowsi, arresting illegal money changers and ordering licensed exchange bureaux and other shops closed, witnesses told"   <hyperlink> Agence France Presse.  <paragraph>  The Iranian rial's value against the dollar declined by about a third in the past week.  <paragraph>  Romney has argued that he would have moved earlier with tougher sanctions against Tehran.  <paragraph>  The new unrest doesn't indicate that the sanctions are achieving their goal of persuading the Iranians to abandon the nuclear weapons program they insist they're not pursuing. And barring some dramatic change in the coming days, Romney can continue to argue that the administration was slow to embrace tougher sanctions and spent too much time pursuing a rapprochement with Tehran. In addition, scenes of chaos abroad underscore Romney's overall argument that Obama has failed to handle foreign policy capably and that the dangerous world threatens to crash in on the U.S.  <paragraph>  That said, the current clashes and tear gas in the streets are disarming to Romney because they allow Obama to respond to any Iran-related criticism by observing that the sanctions are causing a level of tumult in Iran that could plausibly lead to a change in the nuclear policy.  <paragraph>  Part of the Oct. 16 Obama-Romney debate in New York and all of the Oct. 22 debate in Florida are expected to be devoted to foreign policy issues.
Does Romney have tax shelters? | <paragraph>  A tax shelter, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder.  <paragraph>  In the wake of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's disclosure Friday of his tax 2011 returns, President Barack Obama's campaign charged that the returns show Romney is dodging some of his tax obligations.  <paragraph>  "His release also confirmed what we already knew, which is that he pays a lower rate than most middle-class families because of a set of complex loopholes and tax shelters, and raised more questions than provided answers," Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Saturday.  <paragraph>  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) also seemed to advance the shelter claim, saying, "Once again, we see Mitt Romney is out of touch with middle class families, who don’t have the luxury of accounting wizards and foreign tax shelters."  <paragraph>  Romney's campaign issued a statement Friday in which former IRS commissioner Fred Goldberg reissued his previous opinion that not only were Romney's returns on the up-and-up, but that there was no evidence he'd made any particular effort to lower his tax burden. "There is no indication or suggestion of any tax-motivated or aggressive tax planning activities," Goldberg said.  <paragraph>  I asked the Obama campaign how the returns show Romney has tax shelters. A spokesman sent a few news clippings that use that term, including   <hyperlink> a news story in The Washington Post and   <hyperlink> an editorial in The New York Times.  <paragraph>  Asked if Romney considers any of the investments to be "tax shelters," a spokesman replied: "These funds are all registered with the IRS and report all income to investors and the IRS. The Romney's are taxed on the income from these investments by the blind trust  the same way they would be if the shares were held in the US. No taxes are evaded or reduced."  <paragraph>  Part of the disagreement comes down to issues around the definition of "tax shelters." There are plenty of ways to limit or eliminate tax on certain income. Many, like investing in state or municipal bonds, are so commonplace that it would be hard to call them shelters. Other techniques are still legal but more obscure. And still others are of dubious legality, consisting of transactions that have little or no economic benefit but huge tax benefits. <paragraph>  Most of the buzzwords that make for good TV ads, about investments in the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, relate to a fairly standard practice of placing overseas U.S.-run investment funds with multiple foreign owners so that foreign investors aren't subject to U.S. taxes. Those foreigners might well dodge taxes, legally or illegally, on that income, but a U.S. citizen is still required to report and pay taxes on worldwide income.  <paragraph>  However,  <hyperlink> The Wall Street Journal reported in January about one tactic Romney (or his blind trust trustee) uses that appears to have the benefit of preventing immediate taxation of some investment income in his unusually large individual retirement account. Some of Romney's investments in that account, which are parked offshore, would be subject to an immediate 35 percent U.S. tax on earnings if kept here.  <paragraph>  However, the Romney campaign countered to the Journal that those investments were not evading U.S. taxes, but preserving the tax-deferred nature of IRAs in which millions of Americans invest. "Governor Romney’s IRA is tax deferred, just like the IRA’s of every other American.  Its investments are in compliance with rules created to keep it tax deferred, just like it was intended to be," a spokesman told the newspaper.
White House: anti-Islam film 'truly abhorrent' |  <paragraph>  A top White House official has blasted as "truly abhorrent" the anti-Islam film that appears to have triggered an outpouring of violence against U.S. diplomatic posts in Egypt and Libya.  <paragraph>  Speaking to an international religious freedom conference in Washington on Wednesday, Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough endorsed efforts to create "a world where the dignity of all people — and all faiths — is respected."  <paragraph>  According to his prepared remarks released by the White House, he then added: "This work takes on added urgency given the truly abhorrent video that has offended so many people — Muslims, and non-Muslims alike — in our country and around the world."  <paragraph>  President Barack Obama's criticism earlier Wednesday of the "Innocence of Muslims" film, or film trailer in question, was a bit more reserved.  <paragraph>  In an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes," Obama said: "This film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that."  <paragraph>  And in a statement in the Rose Garden on Wednesday morning, Obama said in an apparent reference to the video: "We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others."  <paragraph>  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also described the video as "inflammatory."  <paragraph>  GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has not, thus far, criticized the video. He has faulted the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and the Obama administration for statements he that said sympathized with those attacking U.S. embassies because of the film. Romney charged Wednesday that the initial statements were "effectively apologizing for the right of free speech."  <paragraph>  In his remarks Wednesday, McDonough also condemned the violence that apparently led to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and at least three other Americans in Libya.  <paragraph>  The conference where McDonough spoke was sponsored by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, an organization that has been sharply at odds with the Obama White House over its efforts to force religiously affiliated hospitals and universities to cover birth control costs for their insured employees.  <paragraph>  Later in his remarks, McDonough — an observant Catholic — referred to Obama as a "brother in Christ" and said "faith has been a guiding force in [Obama's] own life."
Ex-Senate aide Doug Hampton gets probation |  <paragraph>  A former aide to ex-Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), Doug Hampton, was sentenced Wednesday to one year probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of federal ethics statute, court records show.  <paragraph>  Hampton, who left his job as Ensign's administrative assistant after learning of an affair between his wife and the senator, admitted earlier this year that he broke the law when he lobbied a former colleague within a year of leaving the Senate.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell's sentence of one year probation was in line with the defense recommendation. Prosecutors had asked for two years probation.  <paragraph>  In court papers, Hampton's attorney  <hyperlink> painted his client's mistake as part of a messy personal and professional situation that resulted from Ensign's affair. Ensign resigned from the Senate last year after being sharply criticized in a Senate ethics committee report.  <paragraph>  Howell noted that Hampton appeared to be the only person ever sentenced under that legal provision,  <hyperlink> Reuters reported. "You are unique," the wire service quoted Howell as saying.  <paragraph>  Hampton said Wednesday he was "very relieved" about the sentence,  <hyperlink> according to the Associated Press.
