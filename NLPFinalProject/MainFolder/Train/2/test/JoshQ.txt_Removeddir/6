Fast and Furious report hearing slips |  <paragraph>  A House hearing about a forthcoming Justice Department report on the Fast and Furious scandal has slipped to next week, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced Monday.  <paragraph>  Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) had scheduled the hearing on the yet-to-be-released Office of Inspector General report for Tuesday, Sept. 11. However, the panel delayed the hearing to Wednesday, Sept. 19.  <paragraph>  No reason was given for the delay. However, Inspector Michael Horowitz is expected to testify at the session about his report on the so-called gunwalking tactic and its use by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  <paragraph>  Issa seems to be trying to time the hearing to the release of the report, which will conclude a year-and-a-half long inquiry into Fast and Furious, an operation that may have allowed as many as 2,000 weapons to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels.  <paragraph>  A spokesman for Horowitz declined to comment on the status of the report.  <paragraph>  The House investigation into the operation has prompted President Barack Obama to assert executive privilege to withhold some documents relating to the Justice Department's response to the imbroglio. The oversight panel's lawsuit seeking those documents is pending in U.S. District Court in Washington.
