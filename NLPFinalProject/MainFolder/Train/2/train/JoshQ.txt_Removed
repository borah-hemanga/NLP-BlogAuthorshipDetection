Foreign Policy mag fights suit by Abbas's son |  <paragraph>  Foreign Policy magazine is asking a federal court to toss out   <hyperlink> a libel suit filed by Yasser Abbas, a son of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, over   <hyperlink> a commentary the international affairs journal published in June suggesting that Yasser Abbas has grown wealthy due to his father’s political position. <paragraph>  In legal papers filed this month in U.S. District Court, Foreign Policy—a division of the Washington Post Co.—argues that Abbas’s lawsuit is part of a pattern of litigation aimed at intimidating his critics.  <paragraph>  Foreign Policy’s attorneys also argue that the lawsuit should be dismissed in accordance with a District of Columbia law passed in 2010 and aimed at ensuring robust debate on issues of public significance.  <paragraph>  “While Abbas’s legal strategy might sometimes be effective in places in the world with lesser protection for freedom of speech and the press than in the United States, it certainly cannot pass muster under the First Amendment – let alone in the District of Columbia, which has enacted legislation to address this precise scenario, which involves a classic Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation,” lawyers Kevin Baine of Williams and Connolly and Nathan Siegel of Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz wrote in the Nov. 5 motion to dismiss (posted   <hyperlink> here).  <paragraph>  So-called anti-SLAPP laws allow for the expedited dismissal of defamation suits when a plaintiff does not have evidence at the outset of a case that he or she is likely to prevail. They’ve been passed in numerous states and jurisdictions to crack down on the practice of companies and individuals filing lawsuits that can drain a target financially even if the suits have little chance of ultimate success on the merits.  <paragraph>  It’s not entirely clear that the D.C. anti-SLAPP law applies in federal court, but the magazine’s lawyers say the weight of legal precedent suggests that it does.  <paragraph>  Foreign Policy also filed a separate motion arguing that Abbas’s suit should be dismissed because the commentary, written by Jonathan Schanzer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies was largely a question-raising exercise that did not make factual assertions, was essentially opinion protected by the First Amendment, and generally didn’t meet the definition of libelous material.  <paragraph>  The case is pending before Judge Emmet Sullivan, who has not yet ruled on the motions. (Yasser Abbas's complaint against Foreign Policy, the Post company and Schanzer, was filed in September and is available   <hyperlink> here courtesy of Courthouse News.)  <paragraph>  The Abbas lawsuit evokes a libel case filed against the Washington Post itself three decades ago by William Tavoulareas, the head of Mobil Oil, and his son Peter, over a 1979 news article arguing that Peter had won shipping business from Mobil as a result of his father's position. That case went to trial and resulted in a $2 million verdict against the Post. However, the judge who presided over the trial granted a post-trial motion tossing out the verdict and the suit.  <paragraph>  In 1987—some eight years after the article indispute was published, the D.C. Circuit sitting en banc,  <hyperlink> upheld the decision to toss out the verdict. <paragraph>  Baine, one of the lawyers defending Foreign Policy in the Abbas suit, was part of the team that defended the Washington Post in the marathon Tavoulareas litigation.  <paragraph>  Disclosure: One of the firms representing Foreign Policy, Levine Sullivan, also does legal work for POLITICO .
U of Denver removes, restores Paula Broadwell video | <paragraph>  <video>  <paragraph>  <video> <paragraph>  The University of Denver removed a speech by alleged David Petraeus paramour Paula Broadwell from YouTube earlier Monday but later re-posted it, a spokeswoman for the school confirmed.  <paragraph>  "We did remove it for a few hours this morning while we were conducting an internal review.  Sorry, again for the inconvenience," spokeswoman Kim DeVigil wrote in response to a query from POLITICO. Despite our inquirites, she did not elaborate on who initiated the review or why.  <paragraph>  Despite the re-posting the video on the university's official YouTube account, a number of blog posts relating to it continue to show that "this video has been removed by the user." That's because the video was re-posted with a different link. <paragraph>  Some recent press reports suggested Broadwell may have shared sensitive or classified information in her Oct. 26 remarks at a D.U. alumni event. However, most or all of what she said about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya was reported earlier that day by Fox News, as we noted   <hyperlink> here.
Broadwell spoke of access to classified info |   <paragraph>  <video>  <paragraph>  Paula Broadwell, the author, military reservist and West Point graduate who reportedly had an extramarital affair with former CIA director David Petraeus, told an audience this summer that she routinely had access to classified information while researching a book on Petraeus's work as the commanding general in Afghanistan.  <paragraph>  During a panel discussion, Broadwell said her background  in the military and her continuing obligations as a major in the Army Reserve made her particularly careful not to disclose sensitive information she was privy to while an "embed" in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011.  <paragraph>  "I was entrusted with this opportunity to sit in on high level meetings with General Petraeus. Sitting in on SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility] meetings in the morning, listen to classified chatter of terrorist talk and so forth. And I had that background anyhow, so I knew a lot of that information for my writing, but I knew there was a clear line that I couldn’t cross when I was writing it out," Broadwell said in   <hyperlink> the July 2012 discussion at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Paula Broadwell in media spotlight)  <paragraph>  Broadwell acknowledged that her connection to the military and her role as a writer sometimes caused confusion among military personnel she encountered while working on the book.  <paragraph>  "I was embedded with Gen. Petraeus in Afghanistan and it was a little confusing for some of the folks there because I’m also a military reservist with a top secret/SCI clearance and then some. So, a lot of my former peers didn’t know how to treat me. Was I journalist Broadwell or was I Major Broadwell?" she recalled. "I had to follow very clear lines of non-disclosure and signed non-disclosure agreements like my colleagues. I felt like I was almost held to a higher level of accountability because I could lose my clearance."  <paragraph>  Broadwell's access to classified information has drawn scrutiny in the wake of reports that investigators found classified records on her computer and that a whistleblower approached House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) recently to express concern that a relationship Petraeus had may have led to classified information being compromised. The discovery of the classified information on Broadwell's computer was   <hyperlink> reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The involvement of Cantor, whose staff said the information was immediately passed on to the FBI, was   <hyperlink> disclosed Saturday by the New York Times.  <paragraph>  Other news reports have also raised questions about Broadwell's access to classified information, including details related to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in September.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Critics question Petraeus's timing)  <paragraph>  In a speech last month at the University of Denver, Broadwell said that the CIA at one point was holding prisoners at an annex near the consulate, and that the assault may have been an effort to free those prisoners. "I don't know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually—had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. So, that's still being vetted," she said, according to a video of the Denver event posted online and first   <hyperlink> reported by the Israeli media outlet Arutz Sheva.  <paragraph>  Later in her remarks, Broadwell, said some of her information had come from a Fox News report.  <hyperlink> Fox said Monday that it's "original" Oct. 26 report did mention three Libyan militia members being turned over by the CIA to Libyan authorities. That detail   <hyperlink> does not appear in the version of the story now posted online, but Fox reporter Jennifer Griffin did include it in at least one report.  <paragraph>  "We're also told, those at the CIA annex took into custody three Libyan attackers and were forced to hand them over to the Libyan February 17th forces that came to help at the annex approximately 4:00 in the morning. They handed these three Libyans over. It is not clear from U.S. officials what happened to the libyans and whether those Libyan attackers were in fact released in in the end by the Libyans," Griffin reported.  <paragraph>  The CIA has denied holding any prisoners at Benghazi and has vigorously disputed other aspects of Griffin's report, but it's not clear Broadwell said anything in Denver that was not previously reported by Fox. (Griffin first issued her report at about 11 A.M. Eastern Time that day. Broadwell, per  <hyperlink> a D.U. schedule, spoke after 7 P.M. Mountain Time.)  <paragraph>  At the Aspen conference in July, panel moderator Clark Bell of the McCormick Foundation said "certain elements" of Broadwell's book, "All In: The Education of David Petraeus," underwent a pre-publication security review to scrub it of classified information.  <paragraph>  Journalists embedded with the military often have access to some classified information. The practice falls into a kind of gray area. Many embed assignments would be hard to undertake without knowing some sensitive information about tactics and upcoming operations. But, journalists don't have security clearances and are not subject to background investigations.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: 10 fast facts about Gen. Petraeus)  <paragraph>  In any event, Broadwell said she did not consider herself a journalist. In her remarks to the security professionals, journalists and government contractors at the Aspen event, she repeatedly used language that stressed how familiar she was with secret matters. During her relatively brief comments, she spoke of working for a Joint Terrorism Task Force, of her top secret clearance "and then some," and of familiarity with "Five Eyes" efforts—lingo for U.S. Government intelligence information shared only with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.  <paragraph>  While Broadwell stressed the access she had, she also said she was especially vigilant to not disclose any classified information because it would have been a breach of trust between her and Petraeus, whom she described as a mentor. <paragraph>  "Sometimes, obviously, the government just cant disclose sources and methods and so forth," she said. "That was just reinforced when I had access to everything, it was my responsibility not to leak it—not to violate my mentor, if you will. I was writing about a very close mentor."  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Monday, 1:45 P.M.): An earlier version of this post said Fox News did not appear to have reported that prisoners were taken by the CIA in Benghazi. Fox says it did report something similar to that on Oct. 26.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Monday, 2:02 P.M.) We've located the original Fox quote and posted it above.
Judge sets hearing in Ohio provisional-votes fight |  <paragraph>  A federal judge has set a hearing for Wednesday morning—the morning after Election Day—to hear arguments about the rules for counting provisional ballots in Ohio.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Court Judge Algenon Marbley set the 11 A.M. Wednesday session in Columbus via an order issued Monday afternoon and posted   <hyperlink> here.  <paragraph>  Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted issued a directive Friday that requires voters to complete the identification section on provisional ballots, rather than pollworkers. A variety of unions, a homeless-aid group and the Ohio Democratic Party say having voters fill that out themselves could lead to inaccuracies or errors. The labor groups and Democrats have asked Marbley to order the state to count provisional ballots even if that identification information is incomplete.  <paragraph>  "Since this suit bears on Ohio’s conduct of the November 6, 2012 election, it is appropriate to deviate from the Local Rules in order to expedite the briefing schedule and timely resolve the question. The timing is particularly sensitive given the need for Defendant Husted and the State of Ohio to issue instructions to election officials in conformity with this Court’s decision prior to the counting of provisional ballots," Marbley wrote in Monday's order.  <paragraph>  Marbley gave Ohio authorities until the end of the day Tuesday to file any written opposition to the plaintiffs' demand.  <paragraph>  The judge appears to view the matter as not of such urgency as to require action before Election Day because the relief the plaintiffs' are seeking is not to change Husted's order to pollworkers regarding who fills out the ID information, but rather the question of which ballots will ultimately be counted.  <paragraph>  Under Ohio law, the provisional ballots cannot be officially tabulated before Nov. 17th.
Lawsuit filed over Florida early voting waits |  <paragraph>  The Florida Democratic Party filed a federal lawsuit early Sunday over the extended delays some south   <hyperlink> Florida voters faced during the last official day of early voting on Saturday, when some who turned out to vote waited as long as six hours to cast their ballots. (A copy of the complaint is posted   <hyperlink> here.)  <paragraph>  However, it's not clear what more can be done about the situation at this late date and the three counties the Democrats sued seem to be offering the only specific relief sought in the suit—allowing voters to vote in person at each county's central elections office through Tuesday. <paragraph>  Miami-Dade County election officials announced that they would allow in-person absentee voting on Sunday afternoon from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M. It's something of an end-run around the Florida legislature's effort to reduce early voting days to eight from a maximum of 14 previously. Democrats have complained about the changes, calling them a Republican effort to disenfranchise voters, especially attendees of black churches who had bussed parishoners to the polls on the Sunday before Election Day. Defenders of the changes said the 14 days of early voting were too costly and distracting for election organizers.  <paragraph>  However, the Miami-Dade office closed its doors around 2 P.M., saying the staff and equipment were overwhelmed by demand,  <hyperlink> the Miami Herald reported. The office reopened later in the afternoon, but the closure angered about 180 potential voters who were locked out, the newspaper said. The Herald later reported that the interruption was due in part to objections from Miami Mayor Carlos Gimenez, who said he'd not been consulted about the change.  <paragraph>  Florida has fairly liberal absentee ballot rules, allowing absentee ballots to be issued to anyone who says he or she can't make it to the polls on Election Day. So, in-person absentee voting is more or less the same as early voting. However, early voting in Florida usually takes place at numerous sites across a county, while in-person absentee is conducted at permanent election offices and sometimes satellite locations.  <paragraph>  "The Elections Department took on this effort to continue serving our voters on the final Sunday before Election Day. While state law does not permit Early Voting today, we do have the authority to provide and accept absentee ballots," Miami-Dade Deputy Supervisor of Elections Christina White told POLITICO via e-mail. Dade County submitted   <hyperlink> this response to the federal lawsuit, calling it moot with respect to their county.  <paragraph>  Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher told POLITICO Sunday afternoon that her office was also allowing in-person voting after experiencing huge demand for the early voting session Saturday.  <paragraph>  "I was here when we were letting our last voter in at 2:30 in the morning," Bucher said. "This morning at 7:30 A.M., we had people waiting so we decided to let them vote in-person, absenteee. We have discretion under Florida law. So we opened up at 9:30 A.M. There's a line wrapped around the building and we're letting them vote."  <paragraph>  Bucher said anyone who's in line at her office by 5 P.M. Sunday will be permitted to vote.  <paragraph>  Broward County was also allowing some in-person absentee voting Sunday, but voters who'd made appointments were being given priority,  <hyperlink> the Herald said.  <paragraph>  All three counties also plan to allow in-person absentee voting on Monday and Tuesday.  <paragraph>  "With unprecedented turnout in South Florida, it is still our hope that the court will extend the early voting hours so that every eligible voter has a chance to vote," Florida Democratic Party executive director Scott Arceneaux said in a statement.  <paragraph>  Voters in Orange County, which includes and surrounds Orlando, will also get another chance at early voting Sunday after a suspicious package closed a polling site in Winter Park, Fla. for several hours Saturday. A local judge ordered that polling place to be open again Sunday.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Sunday, 4:00 P.M.): This post has been updated with comments from Bucher and with the Herald's reports of an interruption to voting at the Miami-Dade election headquarters.  <paragraph>  UPDATE 2 (Sunday, 10:17 P.M.): This post has been updated with the Herald's report on Gimenez's role in Sunday's events.
Obama appeals to set rules for Guantanamo lawyers |  <paragraph>  The Obama Administration filed a series of appeals Friday night, seeking to overturn a federal judge's order that blocked the military from unilaterally establishing rules for lawyers who represent prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth   <hyperlink> ruled in September that lawyers who helped detainees bring habeas corpus petitions seeking release from Gitmo could continue to visit and communicate with their clients under the rules judges set. Lamberth rejected the Obama Administration's effort to cast those rules aside once the habeas cases or military commission cases and any related appeals were complete.  <paragraph>  In a blistering opinion, Lamberth noted that all the prisoners had a continuing right of access to the courts and he said the administration's move amounted to "an illegitimate exercise of Executive power." The indictment was a politically pointed one in light of the harsh criticism candidate Barack Obama leveled at President George W. Bush's administration over his assertion of unfettered executive power to prosecute the global war on terror.  <paragraph>  An administration official told POLITICO early Saturday that Friday's filings were made in order to keep open the option of an appeal and that no final decision has been made about whether to see an appeal through. <paragraph>  "The government filed a notice of appeal...to preserve its options in this matter. The consideration of an appeal requires appropriate and thorough deliberation and that process is ongoing," the official said.  <paragraph>  Nevertheless, for now the dispute heads to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Saturday, 10:27 A.M.): This post has been updated with comment from an administration official.
Romney dusts off Jobs Council attack |  <paragraph>  GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney went after President Barack Obama on Friday for long-term neglect of his jobs council, dusting off an attack Romney mounted aggressively in July but later largely dropped from his campaign rhetoric.  <paragraph>  Obama "put together a jobs council. These were people he picked from industries around the country. He brought them in to give him advice as to how to create jobs. Do you know how long it’s been since he met with the jobs council? Nine months! Can you imagine that? Nine months!" Romney said during a stop at a mining equipment factory in Etna, Ohio. "Let me tell you: well, first of all, I like business and I’m going to have a lot of people offering advice but I know a good deal about it myself to begin with. And that’ll help being president.”  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> POLITICO reported in July that the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness had not held an official meeting in six months and had not met with Obama during that time. Following the report, both Romney and the Republican Party   <hyperlink> unleashed a fusillade of attacks on Obama, arguing that his apparent neglect of the panel was symbolic of his failure to craft policies to spur job creation.  <paragraph>  However, Romney hasn't said much, if anything, about the Jobs Council since. It was not mentioned in any of his three debates with Obama. The GOP candidate may have dialed back the criticism because some who served on the panel are Republicans or conservatives and an attack on Obama for not meeting with the panel is hard to distinguish with an attack on the panel itself for failing to meet. (One prominent Jobs Council member, Intel CEO Paul Otellini, endorsed Romney earlier this week.)  <paragraph>  A White House spokesman suggested in July that Obama had been too busy to meet with the panel in recent months, saying the president had "a lot on his plate." However, sources familiar with the council said an in-person meeting was likely being avoided because the business leaders on the panel felt awkward appearing with Obama in the midst of a presidential election. Rifts had also developed between the CEOs and the few labor leaders in the group.  <paragraph>  In   <hyperlink> a follow-up story in August, POLITICO noted that the council has held monthly, private telephone calls to discuss its recommendations with Obama Administration officials—a practice which disturbs transparency advocates. The last event of any kind   <hyperlink> noted on the Council's website was in June.  <paragraph>  White House officials say the panel's recommendations have been in large part adopted by the administration, though some require action by Congress. However, Romney is correct that the last official council meeting was more than nine months ago, on Jan. 17, 2012.  <paragraph>  The Obama campaign did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Romney's renewed critique. —James Hohmann contributed to this post.
In pitches to troops, presidential candidates dodge and weave |  <paragraph>  In lobbying U.S. military personnel for their votes, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney sounds quite different than he did in the most recent debate, while President Barack Obama doesn't seem to want to square up with a key critique of his policy in Afghanistan.  <paragraph>  The Obama and Romney campaigns recently answered questions submitted in writing by Stars and Stripes about issues the independent, partially-federally-funded newspaper considered most of concern to soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, as well as veterans.  <paragraph>  The   <hyperlink> Romney camp's answer to Stars and Stripes on Afghanistan is striking for its contrast with what the GOP hopeful said at the foreign policy debate on Monday and in a foreign policy speech earlier this month. In the statement released to the military audience, Romney branded Obama's decision to announce a withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014 as "an enormous mistake."  <paragraph>  "Gov. Romney believes it was an enormous mistake to communicate a withdrawal to our enemies as it makes our transition mission more difficult," the statement sent to Stars and Stripes said. <paragraph>  If Romney believes that was an "enormous" error, it's odd he didn't mention it during the debate or during his speech at the Virginia Military Institute, where he alluded in vague terms to Obama decisions some people disagree with and warned against a politically-timed retreat, all while endorsing the 2014 timetable.  <paragraph>  In the debate, Romney seemed to drop his earlier talk of a 2014 withdrawal being dependent on conditions on the ground. "We'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014....We're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point," Romney said, sounding as certain of an on-time withdrawal as Vice President Joe Biden did in his debate and more certain than Obama does, aside from this weekend off the reservation.  <paragraph>  The   <hyperlink> Obama camp's answers to Stars and Stripes also included their share of sophistry, dodging a key question about the public pull-out timetable: "Does the plan give enemy fighters an incentive to lie in wait until the U.S. leaves?" None of the sentences the Obama team provided responds directly to that point. There's also no direct response to whether the president is concerned that attacks on U.S. soldiers by Afghan personnel could so disrupt training that a successful transition could be jeopardized.
Judge speeds Fast and Furious contempt lawsuit |  <paragraph>  A House committee's lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder over his refusal to turn over some documents related to the fallout from Operation Fast and Furious will move forward at a faster pace than the parties requested, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.  <paragraph>  The Justice Department   <hyperlink> moved on Oct. 15 to throw out the lawsuit brought by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and agreed with the House panel that it's lawyers could have two months to respond to that motion. However, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected that proposal on Wednesday, saying that the House committee should file its response by Nov. 16.  <paragraph>  "The Court is usually quite receptive to requests to extend the time limits imposed by the local rules, but the parties have not set forth grounds that would support the establishment of a schedule that is as expansive as this one. Moreover, the Court has determined that it is appropriate to resolve the pending motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction before establishing a schedule for the briefing and consideration of motions on the merits," Jackson wrote. <paragraph>  Jackson said the Justice Department could reply to the House panel by Dec. 10. She also set a status hearing for Nov. 27.  <paragraph>  The lawsuit tests the authority and the willingness of the courts to intercede in a dispute between Congress and the Executive Branch over access to documents Congress says it needs to carry out its oversight responsibilities. President Barack Obama exercised executive privilege to block disclosure of the records, which detail part of the Justice Department's response to Congress and the media in the wake of the controversy over Fast and Furious, a gunrunning investigation which may have allowed as many as 2000 weapons to flow from U.S. gun dealers to Mexican drug cartels.  <paragraph>  Despite Obama's invocation of executive privilege,  <hyperlink> the House voted in June to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress and to authorize the filing of a lawsuit to compel production of the materials.
Family Research Council shooting suspect charged with terrorism |  <paragraph>  The man charged with shooting a security guard at the Washington office of the Family Research Council in August now faces a terrorism charge, federal officials announced Wednesday.  <paragraph>  Floyd Lee Corkins, II,  28, of Herndon, Va. was indicted Wednesday on ten charges, including violating District of Columbia law by committing an act of terrorism while armed. A Justice Department statement said it was the first time anyone has been charged under the District's 2002 anti-terrorism law, which defines terrorism as illegal acts undertaken to “intimidate or coerce a significant portion of the civilian population of the District of Columbia or the United States.” The offense carries a possible sentence of 30 years in prison.  <paragraph>  On Aug. 15, Corkins allegedly walked into the FRC's building at 801G Street NW, took a handgun out of a backpack and fired at an unarmed security guard, striking him in the arm. The guard subdued Corkins and was not critically injured, according to court filings.  <paragraph>  An FBI affidavit filed earlier in the case said that before opening fire Corkins said words to the effect of: "I don't like your politics." In addition, his parents indicated he "has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner." The Family Research Council is a prominent socially conservative organization that has opposed a variety of gay-rights measures, including same-sex marriage.  <paragraph>  Corkins's backpack contained 50 rounds of ammunition and fifteen Chick-fil-A sandwiches. The incident took place amidst publicity over Chick-fil-A executives' support for anti-same-sex marriage legislation.  <paragraph>  Corkins previously faced a federal firearms charge and two D.C. charges. Now, he faces a total of ten charges, including assault with intent to kill and attempted murder.  <paragraph>  CORRECTION: The initial version of this post indicate at one point that the victim of the shooting was killed in the attack. He was wounded but not killed.
George McGovern, contrarian |  <paragraph>  While some of the obituaries published Sunday for the late Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) claim he was an unwavering, unabashed champion of the liberal left, he sometimes strayed from liberal orthodoxy, particularly after he left politics.  <paragraph>  In 1992, McGovern, who had purchased a small inn and restaurant in Connecticut, came out for tort reform.  <paragraph>  "Despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone else. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is frightening," McGovern wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (non-paywalled text   <hyperlink> here.)  <paragraph>  And in 2008, McGovern denounced so-called card-check legislation pushed by large labor unions and endorsed by almost everyone in the Democratic Party establishment.  <paragraph>  "Workers in developing countries such as Mexico insist on the secret ballot when voting as to whether or not their workplaces should have a union," McGovern wrote, again on the Wall Street Journal's op-ed page (excerpts   <hyperlink> here). "We should have no less for employees in our country."  <paragraph>  That fall, McGovern went so far as to tape a 60-second TV ad for opponents of the labor-backed card check measure, known as the Employee Free Choice Act.  <paragraph>  "It's hard to believe that any politician would agree to a law denying millions of employees the right to a private vote," McGovern said in   <hyperlink> the TV spot. "This proposed law cannot be justified. Working families deserve a voice and a private vote. I'm Sen. George McGovern and I approved this message because democracy is something that should never be sacrificed."
Parsing Obama on Guantanamo | <paragraph>  What exactly did President Barack Obama mean when he suggested Thursday that Congress needs to do more to establish a "legal architecture" to govern aspects of the war on terror?  <paragraph>  "One thing we have got to do is put a legal architecture in place and we need congressional help do that to make sure that not only am I reined in, but any president's reigned in, in terms of some of the decisions that we’re making," Obama told Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's "Daily Show."  <paragraph>  Obama made the comment just after he mentioned Guantanamo, so it seemed he may have been referring to some type of legislation to regulate the detention of war on terror prisoners. The remark echoed something the president said more than three years ago, in   <hyperlink> his only speech he devoted to the issue as president.  <paragraph>  "If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.  And so, going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution," Obama said in May 2009.  <paragraph>  If that's what the president was talking about Thursday, it's a bit perplexing because the Obama administration  <hyperlink> decided later in 2009 not to pursue such legislation, even though   <hyperlink> officials determined that 48 of the men at Gitmo needed to be held indefinitely without trial.  <paragraph>  In August 2010,  <hyperlink> Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) filed a bill that would have had Congress set some rules for the process of long-term detention of alleged terrorists. The administration, which had been   <hyperlink> negotiating intensely with Graham months earlier, didn't take a position on the measure, which essentially went nowhere.  <paragraph>  Last year, Congress passed a bill that appeared to give its general endorsement to the procedures the courts have worked out to review the detention of Guantanamo prisoners. Obama initially   <hyperlink> threatened to veto that measure, but   <hyperlink> relented after it was watered down. He also signed that and several other measures that effectively made it impossible for him to carry through on his plan to close Guantanamo.  <paragraph>  Throughout the discussions last year, administration officials signaled that they would have preferred Congress not dig into the issue. However, Obama may have been alluding to hopes some in the administration had early in their talks with Graham that a "grand bargain" might have been possible that would have combined closing Guantanamo with passing detention-related legislation. Those hopes were well dashed by last year and officials seemed uninterested in engaging on detailed detention-related legislation with Congress so stridently opposed to closing Guantanamo and bringing some of its prisoners to the U.S.  <paragraph>  It's conceivable Obama's comment to Stewart was about legislation to give a legal imprimatur to surveillance President George W. Bush untilaterally authorized. But that doesn't make a great deal of sense. Congress passed such legislation in 2008, while Obama was still a senator. Obama's Thursday comments were clearly directed at some kind of unfinished business with Congress.  <paragraph>  It's also possible the president was referring to legislation to regulate the process by which the U.S. authorizes the use of lethal force against individual terrorists abroad, particularly Americans. But the administration has insisted that the internal, secret process the White House, Defense Department and Central Intelligence Agency use to make those kinds of decisions is adequate to the task and has resisted efforts to involve the courts. In fact, Obama suggested later in the interview that a "legal structure and safeguards" were in place on that front. <paragraph>  The White House didn't immediately respond to a query late Thursday seeking more detail about what kind of "legal architecture" Obama wants Congress to put in place relating to terrorism.  <paragraph>  Here's an extended excerpt of the 'Daily Show" exchange: “Obama: There are some things that we haven't gotten done. I still want to close Guantanamo. We haven’t been able to get that through Congress. one thing we have got to do is put a legal architecture in place and we need congressional help do that to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in in terms of some of the decisions that we’re making. There are tough tradeoffs. Sometimes there's bad folks on the other side of the world and you have to make a call and it's not optimal but when you look at our track record what we've been able to do is to say we ended the war in Iraq, we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, we've gone after Al Qaeda and its leadership. it's true Al Qaeda's still active, at least sort of remnants of it, are staging in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Sometimes you have to make tough calls but you can do so in a way that's consistent with international and American law. Stewart: Within that as it ratchets down, i think people have been surprised to see the strength of the Bush-era warrantless wire-tapping laws and those types of things not also be lessened. The strictures that he put in place tthat people might have thought were government overreach and that maybe they had the mind you would perhaps tone down, you haven't. Obama: Well, the truth is we actually have modified them and built a legal structure and safeguards that are in place. That weren't there before on a whole range of issues Now, they're not real sexy issues... Stewart: You don’t know what I find sexy.”
Feds win round in CIA leak case |  <paragraph>  Prosecutors pursuing former CIA officer John Kiriakou for allegedly leaking the identities of two other CIA officers involved in interrogating terror suspects need not prove that Kiriakou intended to harm the United States or help a foreign nation, a federal judge ruled in an opinion made public Wednesday.  <paragraph>  The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema is a defeat for Kiriakou's defense, which asked the judge to insist on the stronger level of proof — which most likely would have been very difficult for the government to muster. <paragraph>  In 2006, another federal judge in the same Northern Virginia courthouse, T.S. Ellis, imposed the higher requirement in a criminal case against two former lobbyists for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.  <paragraph>  However, Brinkema said that situation was not parallel to that of Kiriakou, since he is accused of relaying information he learned as a CIA officer and the AIPAC staffers were not in the government at the time they were alleged to have received and passed on classified information.  <paragraph>  "Kiriakou was a government employee trained in the classification system who could appreciate the significance of the information he allegedly disclosed. Accordingly, there can be no question that Kiriakou was on clear notice of the illegality of his alleged communications. The facts thus clearly differentiate his case" from that of the ex-AIPAC officials, the judge wrote in her 13-page ruling (posted   <hyperlink> here).  <paragraph>  Brinkema also noted that a federal appeals court suggested the rule Ellis established in the AIPAC case, which was dropped in 2009 before trial, may have been erroneous. (One district court judge's ruling is not binding upon another, even in the same district.)  <paragraph>  The gist of Brinkema's ruling was indicated in footnotes to   <hyperlink> a defense filing made public last week and   <hyperlink> reported Monday by Secrecy News. However, the text of her ruling was not released until Wednesday.  <paragraph>  Brinkema's ruling focused on the Epsionage Act counts Kiriakou is facing for allegedly disclosing classified information. He is also charged with revealing the identity of a covert officer and with defrauding the CIA's Publications Review Board by giving it inaccurate information.  <paragraph>  On Tuesday, Brinkema abruptly postponed a major motions hearing in the case set for Wednesday and a hearing set for Thursday on journalists' motions to quash subpoenas from the defense. She gave no reason for canceling the hearings.  <paragraph>  The Washington Post's Julie Tate and freelancer Matt Cole are both fighting subpoenas served on them. A third subpoena, served on The New York Times's Scott Shane, was dropped, a New York Times spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Thursday, 12:32 A.M.): This post has been updated with information from the Times and to clarify a reference to the timing of events in the case.
Court overturns conviction of bin Laden driver |  <paragraph>  A federal appeals court significantly narrowed the power of the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay by ruling Tuesday that those tribunals have no authority to try prisoners for providing assistance to terrorist organizations before 2006. <paragraph>  The ruling from a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the military commission conviction of Salim Hamdan, a Yemeni man who served as a driver to Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. Hamdan was transferred to Yemen in 2008 and released, but the court's ruling could affect other military commission cases. <paragraph>  The judges ruled that material support of terrorism, a common terrorism-related charge in U.S. civilian criminal courts, is not a war crime under international law and therefore is beyond the scope of what military commissions were permitted to do as originally constituted. <paragraph>  "When Hamdan committed the conduct in question, the international law of war proscribed a variety of war crimes, including forms of terrorism. At that time, however, the international law of war did not proscribe material support for terrorism as a war crime. Indeed, the Executive Branch acknowledges that the international law of war did not – and still does not – identify material support for terrorism as a war crime. Therefore, the relevant statute at the time of Hamdan’s conduct....did not proscribe material support for terrorism as a war crime," Judge Brett Kavanuagh wrote. (The opinion is posted   <hyperlink> here.)  <paragraph>  In a footnote, Kavanaugh noted that the ruling would not require Hamdan's release, since he could be detained under the law of war. (Presumably, this was a note about the opinion's application to others still at Guantanamo Bay.) The judge also noted that Hamdan could be charged for post-2006 material support in a military commission.  <paragraph>  There is little dispute that Hamdan could have been charged with material support in front of a civilian U.S. court, but such trials are oridnarily held only on U.S. soil and Congress has now essentially forbidden bringing current Guantanamo prisoners to the U.S. The court's ruling Tuesday leaves open the government's ability to use military commissions to charge individuals with established war crimes, such as intentional killing of non-combatants.  <paragraph>  Judges David Sentelle and Douglas Ginsburg joined in the vast majority of Kavanaugh's opinion. Ginsburg wrote a separate opinion saying that he would prefer to rule that the case was moot since Hamdan was returned to Yemen. However, Ginsburg agreed with the other judges that under current Supreme Court precedent, which lower courts are bound to follow, the case was not moot.  <paragraph>  Several other prisoners at Guantanamo have been convicted of material support, though the only one charged solely with that offense appears to be Australian David Hicks. He pled guilty in 2007 and was transferred to Australia, where he was released a few months later.  <paragraph>  Kavanaugh was appointed to the D.C. Circuit by President George W. Bush. Sentelle and Ginsburg are both appointees of President Ronald Reagan.  <paragraph>  Of course, they may not have the final word on the matter. The Justice Department could ask the full bench of the D.C. Circuit to hear the case or ask the Supreme Court to take it up.  <paragraph>  A Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment.
DOJ: No role for courts in Fast and Furious contempt fight |  <paragraph>  The federal courts have no authority to intervene in the dispute that led to President Barack Obama asserting executive privilege for the first time in the context of a Congressional inquiry, the Justice Department argued in a legal brief filed Monday night.  <paragraph>  Soon after that assertion of privilege in June, the House voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents related to a House probe of the Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal.  <paragraph>  The Justice Department brief (posted   <hyperlink> here) argues that the executive branch's decision not to comply with such subpoenas or portions thereof cannot be second-guessed or rejected by the judiciary—a sweeping claim of executive power that aligns the Obama administration with the stance President George W. Bush's administration took in a similar dispute in 2008.  <paragraph>  "An assumption of jurisdiction here would short-circuit the constitutional design and threaten to alter permanently the relationship among the Branches," Justice Department lawyers contend in the 46-page brief, arguing that Congress has many other avenues open to it to try to force compliance with the subpoena. "Filing suit is far easier than mustering the votes necessary to cut appropriations, defeat legislation, or override a veto, and is far less visible to constituents. A decision allowing the case to proceed would thus greatly diminish the political costs of inter-Branch confrontation and reduce the incentive for Congress to evaluate and prioritize the demands of its myriad committees."  <paragraph>  The brief notes at length the extensive back-and-forth between the Justice Department and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee over documents related to the panel's probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operation that reportedly allowed as many as 2000 firearms to flow from legal U.S. gun dealers to narcotraffickers in Mexico.  <paragraph>  One of the resolutions of contempt voted against Holder in June authorized the filing of a lawsuit to enforce the committee's subpoena. The panel   <hyperlink> filed such a suit in July in U.S. District Court in Washington.  <paragraph>  "This Court should not permit the Committee to circumvent this historical—and in this case, fruitful—process of negotiation and accommodation by seeking resolution of this inherently political dispute in federal court," the Justice Department argues in the new brief.  <paragraph>  The brief asserts that stepping into the Fast and Furious subpoena dispute would start down a slippery slope that could upend separation of powers by involving the courts in a wide array of disagreements between Congress and the Executive Branch.  <paragraph>  "If a committee of Congress could sue the Executive Branch on the basis of a claimed loss of power in a political dispute, then there would be little question that the President or subordinate officials of the Executive Branch would be entitled to bring political disputes with Congress into the judicial forum....Thus, the Judiciary would become the final arbiter of any political dispute between the Branches—or even one between officials of the same Branch—a result that is contrary to our constitutional scheme," the Justice Department lawyers write.  <paragraph>  "A court would have to weigh the relative interests of the political Branches and decide which interest prevails, either by elevating one over the other on a categorical basis or by enmeshing the court in the minutiae of the dispute between the Branches. Such an unmoored weighing of the interests of the political Branches is one the courts are ill-equipped to make," the brief continues.  <paragraph>  The brief also notes repeatedly that thousands of documents related to the gun operation itself have been turned over to Congress. The present dispute pertains to documents that indicate how the Justice Department and others in the federal government responded to Congressional and media inquiries about the matter.  <paragraph>  Unsurprisingly, the Justice Department brief argues that legal precedent favors the courts staying out of such fights. However, the brief acknowledges that just four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge John Bates ruled that the courts did have authority to force Bush White House officials, including White House Counsel Harriet Miers, to respond to subpoenas from a House committee investigating the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys. <paragraph>  The Miers decision "went down the wrong path, and there have now been more congressional suits challenging executive privilege in the past five years (two) than in the previous 220 years combined. This Court should reject the rash call for judicial intervention here, lest the constitutionally-sanctioned and time-honored process of negotiation and accommodation itself becomes a thing of the past," the Justice Department lawyers argue.  <paragraph>  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stayed Bates's ruling pending an appeal, but the case was resolved without a definitive appellate ruling in the early weeks of the Obama administration. <paragraph>  The committee's suit against Holder has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who was appointed to the bench by Obama last year. Due to the briefing schedule in the case, no ruling is expected until well after the election.
Alito speaks up for Asian Americans | <paragraph>  When the Supreme Court took up the issue of Affirmative Action in higher education Wednesday for the first time in nearly a decade, Justice Samuel Alito seemed to be particularly focused on the program's impact on Asian Americans.  <paragraph>  As lawyer Greg Garre sought to defend the University of Texas's Affirmative Action program, Alito asked about an unusual aspect of the school's racial preference system: it actually seeks out African Americans and Latinos who are privileged socioeconomically and provides a boost in the admissions process.  <paragraph>  "You specifically have the example of the child of successful professionals in Dallas...If you have -you have an applicant whose parents are -- let's say they're — one of them is a partner in your law firm in Texas, another one is a part — is another corporate lawyer. They have income that puts them in the top 1 percent of earners in the country, and they have — parents both have graduate degrees. They deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely average in terms of education and income?" Alito asked.  <paragraph>  "No," Garre insisted. "We want minorities from different backgrounds. We go out of our way to recruit minorities from disadvantaged backgrounds," he said, apparently alluding to another program mandated by state law that admits the top 10 percent of each high school class—effectively admitting a large number of Latinos and African Americans.  <paragraph>  Later, Alito returned again to the issue of whether Asian Americans were being treated fairly in the admissions process.  <paragraph>  "In terms of diversity, how do you justify lumping together all Asian Americans? Do you think — do you have a critical mass of Filipino Americans? Cambodian Americans?" Alito asked.  <paragraph>  "The common form that's used has Asian American, but also, next to that, has a form that says country of origin where that can be spelled out," Garre replied.  <paragraph>  "But do you have a critical mass as to all the subgroups that fall within this enormous group of Asian Americans?" Alito asked.  <paragraph>  "Your Honor, we've looked to whether or not we have a critical mass of underrepresented minorities, which is precisely what the Grutter decision asks us to do," Garre said.  <paragraph>  Alito was arguably the most forceful and argumentative challenger of the Texas program among the justices at Wednesday's arguments. Affirmative action is apparently a subject matter he's had an interest in for some time. At his confirmation hearings in 2006, it emerged that when applying for a job in the Reagan Administration in 1995, Alito listed himself as a member of Concerned Alumni of Princeton, a group whose members expressed concern about rising numbers of women at the university and also challenged some of the school's Affirmative Action practices.  <paragraph>  At his hearings, Alito said he had no recollection of involvement with the group, but may have joined because of its work to support the presence of ROTC military officer training on campus.  <paragraph>  A full transcript of Wednesday's oral arguments is posted   <hyperlink> here.
White House VIP missing from 'West Wing Week' |    <paragraph>  <video> <paragraph>  Guess who doesn't appear in the latest edition of "West Wing Week," a video series the White House cranks out to promote the work of President Barack Obama and his administration?  <paragraph>  Yep, the seniormost of senior White House officials: President Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  The reason for his startling absence: a lack of official presidential events in a week the president largely spent campaigning and preparing for Wednesday's night's debate with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>  Due to the Hatch Act, the federally funded "West Wing Week" isn't allowed to feature political events like fundraisers, election rallies and debates (not that the White House would necessarily be promoting a lot of last week's match-up). In most weeks, that restriction isn't a big deal. But, last week, there were apparently no official events on Obama's schedule suitable to be sliced-and-diced by the White House videomakers.  <paragraph>  According to public schedules released by the White House, the only official events Obama took part in last week were four national security briefings. However, as I reported last month, the public schedule is   <hyperlink> far from a complete roster of official or unofficial presidential events.  <paragraph>  With little grist for the mill last week, the White House video team turned its attention to innovative financial and energy-related smartphone apps and a look at the selection of the White House Christmas tree in North Carolina.  <paragraph>  A White House spokesman says it's not the first time Obama has been left out of his own White House's rundown of "everything that's happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue." Even though the video feature regularly goes on the road with him across the country and around the world, there have been "a few" holiday and vacation periods where the president didn't make the final cut, the aide said. <paragraph>  There should be some usable footage of Obama in the coming week, though. He's scheduled to announce the designation of a new national monument to late labor leader Cesar Chavez in California on Monday.
Tax expert: Romney deduction cap doesn't compute |  <paragraph>  At what level would one have to cap itemized tax deductions to pay for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's proposed reduction in income tax rates?  <paragraph>  Romney suggested in an interview this week that a $17,000 limit might do it. In the debate Wednesday night, he said: "Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people."  <paragraph>  There's no reason, though, that the number has to be so vague. Romney's plan includes a specified number of tax cuts, including lower rates, eliminating the estate tax and abolishing the alternative minimum tax. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan outfit that analyzed Romney's cuts, put the total at $4.8 trillion over 10 years.  <paragraph>  So, I asked one of the center's scholars Thursday what number Romney would have to use as a deduction cap in order to make "revenue neutral" the $4.8 trillion in cuts.  <paragraph>  "It's a negative number," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, which joins with the Brookings Institution to run the Tax Policy Center.  <paragraph>  "A negative number?" I said.  <paragraph>  "There are not enough itemized deductions to offset his rate cuts," Williams said, adding that eliminating all itemized deductions for all income groups would not cover the tab for the proposed cuts."There's just not enough money there."  <paragraph>  The Romney campaign didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this post, but it has accused the TPC of bias. During the debate, Romney said other analysts have a different take. "There are all these studies out there," he said. He also said his tax proposals would unleash hiring and economic growth that would, in turn, generate added revenue.  <paragraph>  A tax expert with the Heritage Foundation, Bill Beach, said it was unfair to assume that the deductions cap would have to offset the entirety of Romney's rate cuts. He said Romney could pick up additional revenues through capital gains taxes collected after repeal of the estate tax and through repatriation of assets now held abroad. Beach also said the TPC analysis made assumptions that weren't necessarily accurate.  <paragraph>  "We don’t run tax plans unless we have detail on the tax plans," Beach said. "President Obama's tax plan is not that much more detailed."  <paragraph>  Williams said capping deductions would be "a very progressive tax change," because only about 30 percent of taxpayers itemize in the first place and they're almost all upper-middle to high income. "It would fall primarily on the rich," he said. "Lower and middle income people generally don't have enough money to spend to take the $17,000 in deductions that would get them to the cap." <paragraph>  Williams also said such a rule would hit hard in high-cost areas where owners of even modest homes can quickly rack up more than $17,000 in home interest, property and state income tax deductions. "It does target people in different geographic areas differently. New York City is going to get killed," the former Congressional Budget Office staffer said, while adding that wasn't necessarily a reason not to impose such a cap.  <paragraph>  Williams said he thinks the $17,000 figure probably correpsonds to some internal calculation the Romney campaign has made, but not released. "Is there a plan written down somewhere? Because we need to see it....This like saying, 'I have some great dessert for you. Don't pay attention to the broccoli sitting on your plate," the tax analyst said.
Iran unrest could undercut Romney critique |  <paragraph>  Reports of violent clashes in Iran due to the precipitous drop in value of the country's currency could upset GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's efforts to paint President Barack Obama's Iran policy as ineffectual.  <paragraph>  Tehran's central bazaar was reported to have been closed Wednesday and riot police were patrolling the streets as public and merchant frustration boiled over, apparently directed at economic woes caused by international sanctions intensified by the Obama Administration. At least one protest against Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad Wednesday was broken up by tear gas, news agencies reported.  <paragraph>  "Photos showed riot police blocking a street with the charred hulks of a garbage can and a motorcycle that had been set on fire. Smoke was rising from the area in central Tehran near the main bazaar,"  <hyperlink> the Associated Press reported. <paragraph>  "Hundreds of police in anti-riot gear stormed the currency exchange district of Ferdowsi, arresting illegal money changers and ordering licensed exchange bureaux and other shops closed, witnesses told"   <hyperlink> Agence France Presse.  <paragraph>  The Iranian rial's value against the dollar declined by about a third in the past week.  <paragraph>  Romney has argued that he would have moved earlier with tougher sanctions against Tehran.  <paragraph>  The new unrest doesn't indicate that the sanctions are achieving their goal of persuading the Iranians to abandon the nuclear weapons program they insist they're not pursuing. And barring some dramatic change in the coming days, Romney can continue to argue that the administration was slow to embrace tougher sanctions and spent too much time pursuing a rapprochement with Tehran. In addition, scenes of chaos abroad underscore Romney's overall argument that Obama has failed to handle foreign policy capably and that the dangerous world threatens to crash in on the U.S.  <paragraph>  That said, the current clashes and tear gas in the streets are disarming to Romney because they allow Obama to respond to any Iran-related criticism by observing that the sanctions are causing a level of tumult in Iran that could plausibly lead to a change in the nuclear policy.  <paragraph>  Part of the Oct. 16 Obama-Romney debate in New York and all of the Oct. 22 debate in Florida are expected to be devoted to foreign policy issues.
Guantanamo prisoner returns to Canada |  <paragraph>  The United States sent to Canada Saturday morning a Guantanamo prisoner who was born in Canada and captured in Afghanistan at the age of 15, announced the Department of Defense.  <paragraph>  Omar Khadr, now 26, was shot in a battle with U.S. Special Forces in Afghanistan in 2002. He was charged with war crimes, including the murder of a Special Forces medic, though some experts expressed doubt about the legality of charging one combatant in a military encounter with killing another barring some sort of unusual circumstances. Khadr's age also complicated the case and drew criticism of it from international human rights groups.  <paragraph>  In 2010, Khadr pled guilty to the charges as part of a plea deal that called for him to serve eight more years in custody, but allowed for his transfer to Canada after a year and included no guarantee of how long he would actually be confined after returning to Canada.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> The Star report notes that Khadr can apply for parole next summer. However, a senior administration official told POLITICO that Khadr will serve out the sentence imposed by the U.S. military commission at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  "We do not provide details of security assurances, but we did have extensive discussions with the Canadians about the way ahead for Khadr. He will be incarcerated and serve out the remainder of his sentence," said the U.S. official, who asked not to be named in discussing the diplomatic discussions.  <paragraph>  Khadr was picked up at Guantanamo before dawn Saturday and was being flown to Canada, the news reports said.  <paragraph>  Khadr's transfer and the recent death of another detainee leave the public count of prisoners at Guantanamo at 166.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Saturday, 9:05 A.M.): This post has been updated with comment from the U.S. official and to note that Khadr is likely to serve at least some additional jail time in Canada.
Obama talked of Libya attack as 'terror' 2 weeks ago |  <paragraph>  Despite a drumbeat from the right and even   <hyperlink> independent fact-checkers that President Barack Obama has been unwilling to label as terrorism the attack on a United States diplomatic mission in Libya, the president indicated just a day after the killing of the American ambassador there that the assault was part of a series of "acts of terror" the U.S. has faced.  <paragraph>  "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for," Obama said   <hyperlink> in a Rose Garden statement on Sept. 12. "Today, we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America.  We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act.  And make no mistake, justice will be done."  <paragraph>  Notwithstanding Obama's initial statement, Republicans have faulted him for failing to use the word "terrorism" to describe the attack, even when he was asked directly about it during an interview on Monday.  <paragraph>  "More than two weeks after the attack on our Consulate in Benghazi, President Obama finally called this what it clearly was: an act of terrorism, not a spontaneous protest against a disgusting video," Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) said in a statement Wednesday. "We recognize that Al-Qaeda involvement in a terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Libya is an inconvenient truth for a President who claims to be destroying Al-Qaeda. But it is not too much to ask why the President and his Administration have taken so long to state what has appeared obvious for a long time about what really happened in Benghazi on September 11, 2012."  <paragraph>  "Why Won't Obama Call It Terrorism?" Republican National Committee Chairman   <hyperlink> Reince Priebus asked in a RealClearPolitics op-ed Thursday. "He [Obama] yet again failed to call it what was: a terrorist attack on the 11th anniversary of 9/11....Now, nearly everyone but the president himself has finally admitted: the attack was the work of terrorists."  <paragraph>  The GOP criticism, while a bit sloppy, isn't without any merit. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice did seem to make   <hyperlink> an intentional effort 10 days or so ago to argue that the attack stemmed from a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim video. Her comments were all the more notable because up until that point, the State Department was refusing to answer questions about discrepancies between Libyan and U.S. statements on the issue.  <paragraph>  It's also fair to note that Obama's initial Rose Garden statement implied a link between the video and the attack, as did almost all of the initial news coverage of the deadly violence at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.  <paragraph>  According to   <hyperlink> House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), there's no indication a protest was under way at the consulate when the compound came under assault from rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.  <paragraph>  In addition to Ambassador Chris Stevens, three other Americans were killed in the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi.
Secrecy rule eased in 9/11 case |  <paragraph>  Military prosecutors have agreed to ease secrecy in the case against five alleged Sept. 11 conspirators by ending a presumption that every word the defendants say is classified national security information, defense lawyers said Tuesday.  <paragraph>  "Presumptive classification violates American national security regulations, but it has prevailed for years at Guantanamo Bay,” said James Connell, an attorney for alleged conspirator Ammar al Baluchi. “Hopefully, this change of position will mark the beginning of the end of presumptive classification.”  <paragraph>  Defense attorneys have railed against the presumptive classification procedure, saying it unnecessarily complicated their dealings with their clients and the process for military commissions being carried out at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  Details of the decision are not publicly available, due to—wait for it—a presumption that all court filings could contain classified information and therefore are kept from the public while they await a classification review.  <paragraph>  However, in a statement, chief prosecutor Army Brig. Gen. Mark Martins seemed to confirm the gist of the defense's announcement.  <paragraph>  "As a general matter across all cases, I will say that the government is committed to considering every reasonable and appropriate measure that could help facilitate the attorney-client relationship for those accused before reformed military commissions who seek such a relationship.  This includes measures that, while safeguarding national security and force protection, may also increase the convenience of handling and use by the defense of discussions clients have with their counsel involving classified or potentially classified information," Martins said.  <paragraph>  It's not immediately clear whether the change of procedure will result in more information reaching the public in military commission legal filings or hearings. However, Connell said in an interview that the new process would make it easier for the defense to request and hold hearings on matters not directly related to the defendants' alleged offenses or role in terrorist activity. Defendants might be able to testify at some hearings without them being closed to the public.  <paragraph>  "It will likely have some impact on the transparency of the process," Connell said.  <paragraph>  Connell said it's unclear whether the decision will apply in cases beyond that arising from the Sept. 11 attacks. It does not apply at the moment to the military commission case related to the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, he said.
Does Romney have tax shelters? | <paragraph>  A tax shelter, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder.  <paragraph>  In the wake of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's disclosure Friday of his tax 2011 returns, President Barack Obama's campaign charged that the returns show Romney is dodging some of his tax obligations.  <paragraph>  "His release also confirmed what we already knew, which is that he pays a lower rate than most middle-class families because of a set of complex loopholes and tax shelters, and raised more questions than provided answers," Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Saturday.  <paragraph>  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) also seemed to advance the shelter claim, saying, "Once again, we see Mitt Romney is out of touch with middle class families, who don’t have the luxury of accounting wizards and foreign tax shelters."  <paragraph>  Romney's campaign issued a statement Friday in which former IRS commissioner Fred Goldberg reissued his previous opinion that not only were Romney's returns on the up-and-up, but that there was no evidence he'd made any particular effort to lower his tax burden. "There is no indication or suggestion of any tax-motivated or aggressive tax planning activities," Goldberg said.  <paragraph>  I asked the Obama campaign how the returns show Romney has tax shelters. A spokesman sent a few news clippings that use that term, including   <hyperlink> a news story in The Washington Post and   <hyperlink> an editorial in The New York Times.  <paragraph>  Asked if Romney considers any of the investments to be "tax shelters," a spokesman replied: "These funds are all registered with the IRS and report all income to investors and the IRS. The Romney's are taxed on the income from these investments by the blind trust  the same way they would be if the shares were held in the US. No taxes are evaded or reduced."  <paragraph>  Part of the disagreement comes down to issues around the definition of "tax shelters." There are plenty of ways to limit or eliminate tax on certain income. Many, like investing in state or municipal bonds, are so commonplace that it would be hard to call them shelters. Other techniques are still legal but more obscure. And still others are of dubious legality, consisting of transactions that have little or no economic benefit but huge tax benefits. <paragraph>  Most of the buzzwords that make for good TV ads, about investments in the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, relate to a fairly standard practice of placing overseas U.S.-run investment funds with multiple foreign owners so that foreign investors aren't subject to U.S. taxes. Those foreigners might well dodge taxes, legally or illegally, on that income, but a U.S. citizen is still required to report and pay taxes on worldwide income.  <paragraph>  However,  <hyperlink> The Wall Street Journal reported in January about one tactic Romney (or his blind trust trustee) uses that appears to have the benefit of preventing immediate taxation of some investment income in his unusually large individual retirement account. Some of Romney's investments in that account, which are parked offshore, would be subject to an immediate 35 percent U.S. tax on earnings if kept here.  <paragraph>  However, the Romney campaign countered to the Journal that those investments were not evading U.S. taxes, but preserving the tax-deferred nature of IRAs in which millions of Americans invest. "Governor Romney’s IRA is tax deferred, just like the IRA’s of every other American.  Its investments are in compliance with rules created to keep it tax deferred, just like it was intended to be," a spokesman told the newspaper.
Feds: Hide SEAL name given to Hollywood |  <paragraph>  Last July,  <hyperlink> a top Pentagon official gave two Hollywood filmmakers the name of a Navy SEAL involved in training the squad of commandos who carried out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Now, the Obama administration is fighting to keep that same name from the public.  <paragraph>  In legal papers filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, the Justice Department argued that the government is under no obligation to make public the SEAL's name or the names of Central Intelligence Agency personnel involved simply because officials shared their names, partial names or identities with the makers of a forthcoming movie about the raid, "Zero Dark Thirty."  <paragraph>  "The CIA and DoD did not authorize the filmmakers to make the names they shared with them public, to publicly associate the individuals with the CIA or DoD, or to expose those individuals’ identity in any publicly released film, and there was no reason for the CIA or DoD to have believed that any of this would have happened," the Justice Department brief says. "In fact, [Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Mike] Vickers specifically told [filmmaker] Mark Boal, in providing him with the name of someone he could talk to, that 'the only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any way as a consultant.'"  <paragraph>  "This limited disclosure of the names to the filmmakers does not make the information 'truly public' under the public domain doctrine," DOJ lawyers argue. "The filmmakers were not authorized to release the names publicly, and the names have not, to our knowledge, been released to the public."  <paragraph>  The brief (posted   <hyperlink> here) was filed in a lawsuit the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed against the Defense Department and CIA seeking disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act of records about government cooperation with Hollywood's effort to bring the bin Laden raid to the big screen.  <paragraph>  The dispute over the names puts journalists in an awkward position. Press advocates generally favor broad disclosure under FOIA and a narrow reading of exemptions the government uses to hold back information requested under that law. However, journalists are often privy to the names of officials providing background briefings and sometimes are given sensitive or classified information on condition it not be disclosed. A strict rule that what's given to any outsider must be given to all could wind up restricting journalists' access to that kind of information.  <paragraph>  Generally, the government can't use exemptions from FOIA to withhold information it has officially disclosed elsewhere. However, for the government to lose its right to withhold the info, the previous disclosure has to be essentially identical (which usually makes the whole fight pointless) and part of some permanent public record.  <paragraph>  In the "Zero Dark Thirty" case, the Justice Department contends that even if the government released the name or names in question, it's irrelevant because the whole "public domain doctrine" doesn't apply in cases where personal privacy is at issue. However, the government did not cite any appellate cases in the D.C. Circuit to support that position. <paragraph>  A Pentagon spokesman told POLITICO  in May that while the filmmakers were offered the opportunity to meet with the SEAL raid planner, the meeting never took place. <paragraph>  "Zero Dark Thirty" is slated for release on Dec. 19.
Activists troubled by White House call to YouTube |  <paragraph>  Prominent civil liberties groups expressed concern on Friday over news that   <hyperlink> the White House urged YouTube to review whether an anti-Muslim video posted on the video sharing site violated the firm's policies. <paragraph>  "There's no indication that the government is questioning the right of these idiots to make that repellent film. On the other hand, it does make us nervous when the government throws its weight behind any requests for censorship," the American Civil Liberties Union's Ben Wizner said in an interview Friday.  <paragraph>  "I am actually kind of distressed by this," said Eva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "Even though there are all these great quotes from inside the White House saying they support free speech....by calling YouTube from the White House, they were sending a message no matter how much they say we don't want them to take it down, when the White House calls and asks you to review it, it sends a message and has a certain chilling effect."  <paragraph>  The White House confirmed the request on Friday, but insisted that YouTube was not asked to take down the video, which paints the Prophet Mohammed as sex-crazed and has led to violent protests at U.S. diplomatic posts across North Africa.  <paragraph>  "The White House asked YouTube to review the video to see if it was in compliance with their terms of use," White House press secretary Jay Carney told POLITICO in an e-mail.  <paragraph>  Both Wizner and Galperin said they'd like to know more details about precisely who contacted YouTube, why, and what was asked of the firm.  <paragraph>  A White House spokesman wouldn't offer much additional detail to POLITICO Friday, but said the request took place on Tuesday and was made by a member of the National Security Council staff.  <paragraph>  Galperin told POLITICO it was pretty clear the White House wanted the video taken down. "They were not calling in support of keeping the video up," she said. "The fact they called at all is highly problematic...I don’t think anyone at the White House genuinely thought YouTube had not revewied this video. It is simply ludicrous to say so."  <paragraph>  Wizner said he was not troubled by figures like President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton publicly condemning the video, so long as they made clear that it was protected by the First Amendment.  <paragraph>  "It's staggeringly offensive," Wizner said of the video. "There's nothing inappropriate about government officials expressing strongly held views about speech so long as they understand where the line is," he added, noting that the Supreme Court ruled last year, 8-1, in favor of the right of anti-gay religious protesters to demonstrate at military funerals. "It's hard to imagine speech more repellent, more offensive and more painful than that....It's not sandbox out there."  <paragraph>  Obama did not mention free speech rights in his first remarks Wednesday on the controversy and the possibly related attack that killed four U.S. State Department staffers at a diplomatic post in Libya, including the U.S. ambassador to that country. However, during a press interview a short time later, the president did vow to protect First Amendment rights.  <paragraph>  "We believe in the First Amendment.  It is one of the hallmarks of our Constitution that I’m sworn to uphold.  And so we are always going to uphold the rights for individuals to speak their mind.  On the other hand, this film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that," Obama told CBS's "60 Minutes" later Wednesday.  <paragraph>  YouTube has blocked access to the video on its site by users in Egypt, Libya and India. Afghanistan's government has reportedly blocked all access to YouTube in order to prevent access to the offending video.  <paragraph>  Spokespeople for YouTube, which is owned by Google, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the White House's contact with the company. However,  <hyperlink> in a statement Wednesday—a day after the White House request, the firm said the video was "clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube."  <paragraph>  On Wednesday, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Martin Dempsey,  <hyperlink> called a controversial Christian pastor in Florida to ask him not to screen or promote the film. Dempsey, who was seeking to prevent violence against U.S. military personnel abroad, acted "on his own initiative,"  <hyperlink> a Pentagon spokesman said.
Iranian-American group, leader lose libel case against writer | <paragraph>  A federal judge has thrown out a libel suit charging an author with falsely branding a prominent Iranian-American group and its president with being agents of the regime in Tehran.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Judge John Bates issued   <hyperlink> a decision Thursday rejecting the lawsuit brought by the National Iranian-American Council and its president, Trita Parsi, against writer Seid Hassan Daioleslam.  <paragraph>  Bates said NIAC and Parsi had failed to show evidence of actual malice, either that Daioeslam acted with knowledge the allegations he made were false or with reckless disregard about their accuracy.  <paragraph>  NIAC and Parsi have lobbied against efforts to increase U.S. sanctions on Iran and have sometimes pursued other goals that the Iranian government favors, such as protection of Iranian cultural artifacts that are the subject of legal disputes in the U.S. However, NIAC and Parsi have always insisted that they are representing the interests of Iranian-Americans and not that of the government in Tehran. <paragraph>  Bates made clear in his ruling that he wasn't taking a stand on whether the claims the author made about NIAC and Parsi were true.  <paragraph>  "Nothing in this opinion should be construed as a finding that defendant’s articles were true. Defendant did not move for summary judgment on that ground, and it has not been addressed here," Bates wrote. <paragraph>  A spokesman for NIACsaid the group was reviewing the ruling and would not have a comment until Friday.
White House: anti-Islam film 'truly abhorrent' |  <paragraph>  A top White House official has blasted as "truly abhorrent" the anti-Islam film that appears to have triggered an outpouring of violence against U.S. diplomatic posts in Egypt and Libya.  <paragraph>  Speaking to an international religious freedom conference in Washington on Wednesday, Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough endorsed efforts to create "a world where the dignity of all people — and all faiths — is respected."  <paragraph>  According to his prepared remarks released by the White House, he then added: "This work takes on added urgency given the truly abhorrent video that has offended so many people — Muslims, and non-Muslims alike — in our country and around the world."  <paragraph>  President Barack Obama's criticism earlier Wednesday of the "Innocence of Muslims" film, or film trailer in question, was a bit more reserved.  <paragraph>  In an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes," Obama said: "This film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that."  <paragraph>  And in a statement in the Rose Garden on Wednesday morning, Obama said in an apparent reference to the video: "We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others."  <paragraph>  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also described the video as "inflammatory."  <paragraph>  GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has not, thus far, criticized the video. He has faulted the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and the Obama administration for statements he that said sympathized with those attacking U.S. embassies because of the film. Romney charged Wednesday that the initial statements were "effectively apologizing for the right of free speech."  <paragraph>  In his remarks Wednesday, McDonough also condemned the violence that apparently led to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and at least three other Americans in Libya.  <paragraph>  The conference where McDonough spoke was sponsored by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, an organization that has been sharply at odds with the Obama White House over its efforts to force religiously affiliated hospitals and universities to cover birth control costs for their insured employees.  <paragraph>  Later in his remarks, McDonough — an observant Catholic — referred to Obama as a "brother in Christ" and said "faith has been a guiding force in [Obama's] own life."
Another death at Guantanamo | <paragraph>  A detainee at the prison for terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay was found dead at the facility on Saturday, the U.S. military said in a statement Monday.  <paragraph>  The statement from the U.S. Southern Command did not say precisely where the prisoner was found, but said he was discovered by guards "conducting routine checks."  <paragraph>  "Guards found the detainee unconscious and unresponsive. The guards immediately performed first aid and summoned medical personnel to the scene. The corpsmen provided emergency medical treatment and quickly transported the detainee to Naval Hospital Guantanamo. After extensive lifesaving measures had been performed, the detainee was pronounced dead by a physician," the SOUTHCOM statement said.  <paragraph>  The statement also offered no information on the prisoner's nationality, age or name. Military officials said the prisoner's identity was "being withheld pending notification of the detainee's government and family."  <paragraph>  In accordance with standard procedures, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is looking into the cause and circumstances of the prisoner's death, the statement said.  <paragraph>  According to the last public count, there were 168 war-on-terror prisoners at Gitmo. The number of live prisoners now appears to stand at 167.
Obama: U.S. seeks 'due process' in drone strikes | <paragraph>  The U.S. Government seeks to accord "due process" to terror suspects targeted for drone strikes, President Barack Obama said in a recent interview. <paragraph>  "It's very important for the president and the entire culture of our national security team to continually ask tough questions about, are we doing the right thing, are we abiding by rule of law, are we abiding by due process," Obama said in an interview with CNN first aired on Monday. "And then set up structures and institutional checks, so that, you know, you avoid any kind of slippery slope into a place where we're not being true to who we are." <paragraph>  Obama's comments echo   <hyperlink> Attorney General Eric Holder's remarks in a speech in Chicago in March explaining the legal basis the administration asserts for the drone strikes, part of broader programs sometimes referred to as "targeted killing." However, Holder acknowledged in that speech that the "due process" the administration has employed does not involve an independent review by the courts.  <paragraph>  "Due process and judicial process are not one and the same, particularly when it comes to national security," Holder said then. "The Constitution guarantees due process, it does not guarantee judicial process."  <paragraph>  Critics say the kind of due process Holder and Obama are describing is pretty weak stuff: layers of internal administration review, rather than a more formal process involving a court. One oddity of the current legal situation remains that the U.S. government needs some kind of court-approved warrant to intentionally eavesdrop on the telephone or e-mail of a U.S. citizen suspected of involvement with Al Qaeda, like Anwar Al-Awlaki. However, using a drone, a missile, bomb or military raid to intentionally kill that same person requires no approval from the judicial branch. <paragraph>  Another thing absent here despite the administration's welcome steps towards explaining the scope and legal rationale of the drone programs: transparency. While the various systems for authorizing such strikes have been reported on in  <hyperlink> books like Dan Klaidman's "Kill or Capture" and news stories like   <hyperlink> this one in May in the New York Times, virtually nothing about the mechanics of the process is officially on the record. In addition, it's unclear how if at all the secret authorizing system deals with the issue of whether terrorist suspects, particularly Americans, need to be on notice that the government is seeking them before they're killed in a process that offers no opportunity for surrender on the spot. <paragraph>  The administration has also said that it only uses deadly force where capture is "not feasible," something president described as limiting the program to "very remote areas [where] it's difficult to capture them." However, the question of feasibility, sometime referred to as "undue risk" to the U.S. soldiers or operatives who might carry out an operation, seems highly subjective.  <paragraph>  For instance, the operation that targeted Osama bin Laden probably involved "undue risk" to the troops involved, especially when compared with dropping a huge bomb on the house he was living in. The administration seems to be saying it needn't risk an on-the-ground operation when a drone strike will do the trick. (Of course, bombing bin Laden's house would have likely caused civilian casualties, including those of children. ) <paragraph>  Given all those thorny issues, one can understand why Obama, a former professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago, told CNN's Jessica Yellin that he "absolutely" struggles with the process.  <paragraph>  (By the way, kudos to Yellin for putting the question to Obama in an interview for an election-related CNN documentary. In tweets earlier this week, I credited   <hyperlink> a Cincinnati TV reporter for beating the White House press corps to the punch with the drone-related questions. Turns out Yellin was first and got more out of Obama with sharper questions, though I'm still surprised that it took three years and eight months into Obama's presidency for him to be asked about the subject by a journalist.)  <paragraph>  More on the CNN interview   <hyperlink> here on the 44 blog.
Appeals court sets arguments on Bradley Manning trial access |  <paragraph>  The military's highest appeals court has announced that it will hear oral arguments next month on a bid to allow the press and public direct access to records relating to the pending court martial of Pvt. Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military reports to WikiLeaks.  <paragraph>  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces will hear the case on October 10, a court clerk said Thursday.  <paragraph>  The appeal is styled as Center for Constitutional Rights v. United States of America and Col. Denise Lind. CCR, a civil liberties group, filed the case on behalf of journalists including WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange. On Tuesday, 32 media outlets and organizations, including POLITICO and its parent company,  <hyperlink> filed an amicus brief urging the appeals court to make public the briefs, motions, orders, and docket in the Manning court martial.  <paragraph>  Manning has been in custody since May 2010. He faces 22 charges including aiding the enemy, unauthorized disclosure of national security information and violating orders. He could be sentenced to as much as life in prison. His court martial is currently slated to get underway in January at Ft. Meade, Md.
Ex-Senate aide Doug Hampton gets probation |  <paragraph>  A former aide to ex-Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), Doug Hampton, was sentenced Wednesday to one year probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of federal ethics statute, court records show.  <paragraph>  Hampton, who left his job as Ensign's administrative assistant after learning of an affair between his wife and the senator, admitted earlier this year that he broke the law when he lobbied a former colleague within a year of leaving the Senate.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell's sentence of one year probation was in line with the defense recommendation. Prosecutors had asked for two years probation.  <paragraph>  In court papers, Hampton's attorney  <hyperlink> painted his client's mistake as part of a messy personal and professional situation that resulted from Ensign's affair. Ensign resigned from the Senate last year after being sharply criticized in a Senate ethics committee report.  <paragraph>  Howell noted that Hampton appeared to be the only person ever sentenced under that legal provision,  <hyperlink> Reuters reported. "You are unique," the wire service quoted Howell as saying.  <paragraph>  Hampton said Wednesday he was "very relieved" about the sentence,  <hyperlink> according to the Associated Press.
Press outlets protest Manning trial secrecy |  <paragraph>  More than 30 news outlets and media organizations lodged an official protest Tuesday against secrecy in the court-martial of Pvt Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst accusing of leaking hundreds of thousands of military reports and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.  <paragraph>  The amicus brief filed with the military's highest court, the Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces, supports a request from the Center for Constitutional Rights to allow public access to motions, briefs, written rulings and the docket in Manning's court-martial.  <paragraph>  While hearings in Manning's case have been in large part public, the motions and briefs the prosecution and defense are arguing about are not available from the court. So, those watching the arguments often have trouble understanding precisely what the lawyers are arguing about.  <paragraph>  "This Court should find that such an arrangement is unconstitutional," lawyers Gregg Leslie and Kristen Rasmussen wrote in the brief, which was joined by POLITICO and parent company Allbritton Communications Co. "The inability to view court documents filed in connection with a particular judicial proceeding burdens the news media’s constitutionally protected right to collect and disseminate the news and severely curtails journalists’ ability to do their jobs effectively."  <paragraph>  The brief (posted   <hyperlink> here) also notes that in a tough economic environment, documents may be essential to journalists' ability to report on the case, particularly one as drawn out as that of Manning, who was arrested in May 2010 and currently has a trial date in next January.  <paragraph>  "Public court records, namely the various legal arguments and requests by parties and their counsel contained in the documents, enable journalists to tell the full story, despite the fact that deadline pressures or shrinking news staffs may drastically limit their ability to attend a lengthy judicial proceeding in its entirety," the media brief says.  <paragraph>  Others signing onto the brief included The Associated Press, Atlantic Media, Dow Jones, Gannett, Hearst, CNN, McClatchy, The New York Times, The New York Daily News, Reuters, the Washington Post, The Tribune Co. and The Washington Post.  <paragraph>  Military prosecutors have urged the court to reject the request for direct access to the court-martial filings. Prosecutors say the public can seek to access the records through the Freedom of Information Act, although that process is almost always untimely and the military has flatly rejected past request for Manning related records. <paragraph>  Manning's defense counsel David Coombs has published some filings on his blog, but the prosecution and the judge have forced him to delete the substance of the prosecution's argument along with the names of virtually all individuals other than Manning mentioned in the documents.  <paragraph>  The brief also points out an odd irony: while legal filings in the miltiary commissions trying alleged Al Qaeda members are — after significant lobbying by the media — published on a military-run website, filings in the highly newsworthy court martial of an American soldier are unavailable to the press and public through official channels.  <paragraph>  Court filings in federal civilian court cases are almost always immediately and directly available to the public and press through an electronic docketing system. The Supreme Court has found a common-law right of access to court records and many courts have found a First Amendment right to such records in most circumstances.  <paragraph>  Military courts have recognized a defendant's constitutional right to a public court-martial since at least the 1980s, the media brief says. And the Army Court of Criminal Appeals found a "qualified" First Amendment right of access to court-martial exhibits in 1998.  <paragraph>  In March, media groups sent Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson a letter seeking access to the Manning court-martial filings. Johnson, who was instrumental in setting up online access to the Guantanamo military commission filings, has not responded to the letter.
