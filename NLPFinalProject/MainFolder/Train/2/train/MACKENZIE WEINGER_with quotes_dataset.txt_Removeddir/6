What's the quickest way to Canada? | <video> It’s the age-old election threat: I’ll move to Canada if my candidate loses. <paragraph> Well, on Wednesday morning, FOX23’s traffic reporter Jeff Brucculeri made that promise a little easier for Tulsa residents to fulfill by offering viewers the best route to get to our northern neighbors. <paragraph> “We had some folks make a special request. I know a lot people said that if their candidate lost the election, they’d be moving to Canada — not sure why, but that was some of the folks’ promises out there. So let me give you the quickest and direct-est route to Canada from Tulsa,” he said during the “Beat The Traffic” segment on Tulsa, Oklahoma's FOX23. <paragraph> Brucculeri recommended taking Highway 75 northbound, up through Kansas. “When you get into Omaha, watch for that junction for Interstate 29, because then you want to take I-29,” he said. “Literally, I-29 will go to the Canadian border.” <paragraph> The newsroom erupted with laughter off-screen, but Brucculeri soldiered on with his directions. <paragraph> “They’re laughing at me. Now, when you get to Canada — this is serious stuff,” he said. “When you get to Canada, you’re going to hit the border here, make sure you got either your card or your passport, okay, to get into Canada, now. Then you’re going to get back on what is known as Highway 75 in Canada, or it’s actually the Lord Selkirk Highway. If you’re moving to Canada, you’re going to need to know this. Lord Selkirk Highway, okay?"
