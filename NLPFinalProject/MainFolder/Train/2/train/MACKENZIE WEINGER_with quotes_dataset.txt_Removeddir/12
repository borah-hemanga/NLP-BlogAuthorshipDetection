Roll Call names new editor | David Rapp will be the next editor of Roll Call, CQ Roll Call announced Tuesday. <paragraph> Rapp is heading to Roll Call from Bloomberg Government but previously worked at CQ as editor and senior vice president. He starts his new gig at Roll Call on Nov. 12, one day before the newly merged CQ Today and Roll Call publication is rolled out. <paragraph> “David comes to CQ Roll Call with a wealth of experience in publishing, particularly in digital strategy, and in creating innovative editorial products designed for people who rely on top-notch government information and analysis,” CQ Roll Call editorial director Susan Benkelman wrote to staffers in a note obtained by POLITICO. Benkelman noted that Rapp served as CQ’s first editor of new media, joined Bloomberg as ideas editor, and was editor in chief of Federal Computer Week. He left CQ in 2007 to start a business, TravelBeat.net. <paragraph> “In addition to this online experience, David has all the characteristics we need for the next editor of the new Roll Call: a track record of successful product redesigns and relaunches and a deep understanding of Congress, its community, the institution and its history,” Benkelman wrote in the memo. “He quite literally lives on Capitol Hill, and in the past 28 years he's come to know it as well as anyone in town. He also has an infectious enthusiasm for good stories, and is one of the most collaborative newsroom leaders I've worked with.”
