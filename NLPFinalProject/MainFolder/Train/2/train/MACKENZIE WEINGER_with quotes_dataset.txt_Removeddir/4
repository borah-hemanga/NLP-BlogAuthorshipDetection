NYT CEO faces more scrutiny from NYT | A legal letter about the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal is raising more questions about New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson’s knowledge of the spiked investigation into the BBC host, the Times reported Friday  <hyperlink>  <paragraph> . The Times’ Matthew Purdy wrote that in September, lawyers who represented Thompson and another executive “threatened to sue The Sunday Times in London” over a proposed article about the spiking of the “Newsnight” investigation into Savile. <paragraph> An aide told the Times that although Thompson authorized the letter, he was not aware of what the note detailed. Purdy wrote “interviews show that the letter included a summary of the alleged abuse, including the allegation that some abuse might have occurred at the BBC.” It also threatened “defamation proceedings.” <paragraph> “It’s not clear if he was shown it, but he doesn’t remember reading it,” the aide told the Times. <paragraph> The Sunday Times magazine article never ran, Purdy noted. Thompson did not comment to the Times for the article. <paragraph> Thompson, the former BBC director general who started his new job at the Times on Monday,has said he was not involved in killing the Savile investigation <hyperlink> . He has said he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being dropped, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011. <paragraph> “There were other moments during Mr. Thompson’s final months at the BBC — involving brief conversations and articles appearing in London news media — when he might have picked up on the gravity of the Savile case," Purdy wrote. "But the letter is different because it shows Mr. Thompson was involved in an aggressive action to challenge an article about the case that was likely to reflect poorly on the BBC and on him."
