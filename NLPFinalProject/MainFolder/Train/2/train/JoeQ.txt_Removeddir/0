Campaigns look past the polls | <paragraph> This year's polling data gets more confusing by the day. <paragraph> Barack Obama supporters trash Gallup's methodology as biased and skewed. Mitt Romney partisans seem to attack ANY poll that shows their candidate down — especially in Ohio. Like many in the news business, I spent the past few days on the phone with leaders of both campaigns to get a better grasp on how the final stretch will play out. <paragraph> The contrast in the two camps' thinking was striking. <paragraph> All the president's men believe they have built a turnout machine over the past five years like no other in American political history. Team Obama has been on the ground for five years in Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Iowa, New Hampshire and every other swing state that matters. They have reached out and touched more voters personally than Romney, the Republican National Committee and local party leaders combined. And they believe that five-year head start will lead to victory on Election Day. <paragraph> The Romney campaign is now relying more on the intangibles of the political trade. Boston expects to be swept to victory on Election Day because of debate momentum, partisan passions and that evergreen emotion voters always carry with them into the voting booth called "Change." The great irony for the Romney camp is that their candidate, who has been driven by data and numbers his entire life, now has to rely on the most unpredictable and maddening force of all — human emotion — to carry him over the top and into the White House. <paragraph> Still, neither side dared predict an outcome, and both campaigns are as clueless as to the election's final outcome as you and me. <paragraph> That means the last 10 days are going to be a wild ride for the campaigns, the candidates and the country they both want to run.
