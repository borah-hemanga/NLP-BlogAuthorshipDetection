Tax expert: Romney deduction cap doesn't compute |  <paragraph>  At what level would one have to cap itemized tax deductions to pay for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's proposed reduction in income tax rates?  <paragraph>  Romney suggested in an interview this week that a $17,000 limit might do it. In the debate Wednesday night, he said: "Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people."  <paragraph>  There's no reason, though, that the number has to be so vague. Romney's plan includes a specified number of tax cuts, including lower rates, eliminating the estate tax and abolishing the alternative minimum tax. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan outfit that analyzed Romney's cuts, put the total at $4.8 trillion over 10 years.  <paragraph>  So, I asked one of the center's scholars Thursday what number Romney would have to use as a deduction cap in order to make "revenue neutral" the $4.8 trillion in cuts.  <paragraph>  "It's a negative number," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, which joins with the Brookings Institution to run the Tax Policy Center.  <paragraph>  "A negative number?" I said.  <paragraph>  "There are not enough itemized deductions to offset his rate cuts," Williams said, adding that eliminating all itemized deductions for all income groups would not cover the tab for the proposed cuts."There's just not enough money there."  <paragraph>  The Romney campaign didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this post, but it has accused the TPC of bias. During the debate, Romney said other analysts have a different take. "There are all these studies out there," he said. He also said his tax proposals would unleash hiring and economic growth that would, in turn, generate added revenue.  <paragraph>  A tax expert with the Heritage Foundation, Bill Beach, said it was unfair to assume that the deductions cap would have to offset the entirety of Romney's rate cuts. He said Romney could pick up additional revenues through capital gains taxes collected after repeal of the estate tax and through repatriation of assets now held abroad. Beach also said the TPC analysis made assumptions that weren't necessarily accurate.  <paragraph>  "We don’t run tax plans unless we have detail on the tax plans," Beach said. "President Obama's tax plan is not that much more detailed."  <paragraph>  Williams said capping deductions would be "a very progressive tax change," because only about 30 percent of taxpayers itemize in the first place and they're almost all upper-middle to high income. "It would fall primarily on the rich," he said. "Lower and middle income people generally don't have enough money to spend to take the $17,000 in deductions that would get them to the cap." <paragraph>  Williams also said such a rule would hit hard in high-cost areas where owners of even modest homes can quickly rack up more than $17,000 in home interest, property and state income tax deductions. "It does target people in different geographic areas differently. New York City is going to get killed," the former Congressional Budget Office staffer said, while adding that wasn't necessarily a reason not to impose such a cap.  <paragraph>  Williams said he thinks the $17,000 figure probably correpsonds to some internal calculation the Romney campaign has made, but not released. "Is there a plan written down somewhere? Because we need to see it....This like saying, 'I have some great dessert for you. Don't pay attention to the broccoli sitting on your plate," the tax analyst said.
