George McGovern, contrarian |  <paragraph>  While some of the obituaries published Sunday for the late Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) claim he was an unwavering, unabashed champion of the liberal left, he sometimes strayed from liberal orthodoxy, particularly after he left politics.  <paragraph>  In 1992, McGovern, who had purchased a small inn and restaurant in Connecticut, came out for tort reform.  <paragraph>  "Despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone else. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is frightening," McGovern wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (non-paywalled text   <hyperlink> here.)  <paragraph>  And in 2008, McGovern denounced so-called card-check legislation pushed by large labor unions and endorsed by almost everyone in the Democratic Party establishment.  <paragraph>  "Workers in developing countries such as Mexico insist on the secret ballot when voting as to whether or not their workplaces should have a union," McGovern wrote, again on the Wall Street Journal's op-ed page (excerpts   <hyperlink> here). "We should have no less for employees in our country."  <paragraph>  That fall, McGovern went so far as to tape a 60-second TV ad for opponents of the labor-backed card check measure, known as the Employee Free Choice Act.  <paragraph>  "It's hard to believe that any politician would agree to a law denying millions of employees the right to a private vote," McGovern said in   <hyperlink> the TV spot. "This proposed law cannot be justified. Working families deserve a voice and a private vote. I'm Sen. George McGovern and I approved this message because democracy is something that should never be sacrificed."
