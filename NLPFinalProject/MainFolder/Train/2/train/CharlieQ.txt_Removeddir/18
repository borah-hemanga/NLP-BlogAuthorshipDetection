Jerry Brown's last stand |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   When it comes to   <hyperlink> Proposition 30, the bold tax initiative pushed by California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, the stakes are high — and not just because of the policy implications.  <paragraph>   Dan Walters, a widely respected Sacramento Bee columnist,  <hyperlink> writes that the 74-year-old governor’s legacy hangs in the balance: “   [H]e's now facing the possibility of defeat in what he hoped would be the signal accomplishment of his second governorship — persuading voters to raise taxes and close, albeit temporarily, a chronic state budget deficit.  Fixing California's budget was Brown's major campaign theme in 2010, 28 years after leaving the governorship. He could succeed where other governors — such as predecessor Arnold Schwarzenegger — had failed, he told voters, while promising that he wouldn't raise taxes without their approval. ”  <paragraph>   The polls report that the outcome is very much up in the air, with support just shy of 50 percent, leading Walters to ask, in the event of a loss, “would [Brown] figuratively shrug his shoulders and decide he might find more interesting and positive things to do in the remaining years of his life and forgo another reelection campaign in 2014?”  <paragraph>   There would be no shortage of Democratic talent if Brown declined to run again — Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has already said he will run if Brown doesn’t, and other prospective heavyweights include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Attorney General Kamala Harris.  <paragraph>   A serious primary challenge is also in the realm of possibility. The state’s new top-two primary system — where the top two finishers, regardless of party, move on to the general election — has reordered the state’s political calculus, and it’s not hard to envision scenarios in which it would make sense for an ambitious Democrat to take on a governor whose career in public office began more than four decades ago.
