Obama leads among Asian Americans |  <paragraph>   A new California poll shows why President Barack Obama is again expected to capture the Asian American vote.  <paragraph>   In the state with by far the largest Asian population in the nation, the Field Poll reports Obama holds a 58 percent to 25 percent lead over Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>   In 2008, national exit polls gave Obama a 62 percent to 35 percent advantage over John McCain among Asians, who made up two percent of the electorate.  <paragraph>   According to a  <hyperlink>  Field Poll released Saturday, Obama runs best among California’s Chinese Americans, a group he wins by 63-21. The margin with Vietnamese Americans – a demographic that tends to be more Republican-friendly – is 47-27. Among Korean Americans, Obama leads 41-20 with 39 percent undecided -- the reported percentage of undecided voters among all Asian subgroups is unusually high for this late point in the campaign.  <paragraph>   Among other Asian groups, Obama leads 62-28.  <paragraph>   There’s no data for the Filipino American vote, a constituency where Republicans have had a toehold in the past.  <paragraph>   While the poll notes that the Asian subgroup samples are small, the numbers don’t seem dramatically at odds with a national poll conducted in April by the Democratic firm Lake Research Partners. Back then, nearly six in 10 Asian voters also favored Obama.
