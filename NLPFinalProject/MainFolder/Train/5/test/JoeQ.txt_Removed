Campaigns look past the polls | <paragraph> This year's polling data gets more confusing by the day. <paragraph> Barack Obama supporters trash Gallup's methodology as biased and skewed. Mitt Romney partisans seem to attack ANY poll that shows their candidate down — especially in Ohio. Like many in the news business, I spent the past few days on the phone with leaders of both campaigns to get a better grasp on how the final stretch will play out. <paragraph> The contrast in the two camps' thinking was striking. <paragraph> All the president's men believe they have built a turnout machine over the past five years like no other in American political history. Team Obama has been on the ground for five years in Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Iowa, New Hampshire and every other swing state that matters. They have reached out and touched more voters personally than Romney, the Republican National Committee and local party leaders combined. And they believe that five-year head start will lead to victory on Election Day. <paragraph> The Romney campaign is now relying more on the intangibles of the political trade. Boston expects to be swept to victory on Election Day because of debate momentum, partisan passions and that evergreen emotion voters always carry with them into the voting booth called "Change." The great irony for the Romney camp is that their candidate, who has been driven by data and numbers his entire life, now has to rely on the most unpredictable and maddening force of all — human emotion — to carry him over the top and into the White House. <paragraph> Still, neither side dared predict an outcome, and both campaigns are as clueless as to the election's final outcome as you and me. <paragraph> That means the last 10 days are going to be a wild ride for the campaigns, the candidates and the country they both want to run.
Swing-state math breaks for Obama | <paragraph> Ronald Reagan's run to the White House was quickened by sluggish economies throughout America's most important political swing states in 1980. Those states' downturns doomed the then-sitting Democratic president. <paragraph> Three decades later, a different swing state dynamic may end up helping the current Democratic president living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. <paragraph> A quick look at the latest labor statistics actually shows surprising strength in America's most vital political swing states. <paragraph> Ohio's unemployment rate has been dropping steadily for a year now, and currently sits at 7.3%. Florida's unemployment rate is now 8.6%, a full two percentage points below where it was just one year ago. And Virginia's unemployment rate remains stubbornly low, as that state's Republican governor lines himself up as a possible VP choice. <paragraph> Add the lift that Barack Obama will surely get from Michigan and other Industrial Midwest states aided by the auto bailout and suddenly this year's swing state math seems to break President Obama's way. <paragraph> Of course, it is only June. And as any good Red Sox fan knows, the games don't really start to count until after Labor Day.
Are we all big government conservatives now? |   <paragraph>  Every year, liberal bloggers and talk show hosts become unhinged when polls are released that suggest conservatives outnumber liberals by a 2-to-1 margin. This past year left-wing bloggers became particularly unhinged when a fact-checking organization declared it "mostly true" that the majority of Americans were conservative. Apparently, Politifact's opinion on the semantic difference between  "plurality" and "majority" was of such great import to American liberals that this fake controversy warranted weeks of ideological screeching.  <paragraph>  Hold on to your Cheetos sports fans, because Gallup just <hyperlink> released its annual poll on voters' ideological bent, and once again self-described conservatives outnumbered liberals by a 2-to-1 margin. In fact, 46% of Americans now call themselves "economic conservatives" while only 20% describe themselves as "liberal".  <paragraph>  Predictably, fewer voters labeled themselves "conservative" on social issues.  <paragraph>  So let the screaming match begin between ideological camps. But for those interested in how voters' attitudes will impact the 2012 presidential election, the Gallup poll's trend line suggest that voters are becoming more economically conservative as a reaction to George W. Bush and Barack Obama's big bailouts in 2008 and 2009, and the never-ending debate over health care.  <paragraph>  The obvious irony is that while Americans like to think of themselves as rugged individualists who are perfectly capable of pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, these same cowboys would tar and feather any leader who tried to curb spending on Medicare, Social Security, farm subsidies, defense contracts, student loans or any other part of America's $4 trillion budget.   <paragraph>  So perhaps we are dealing with the self-delusion of citizens who are every bit as addicted to massive government spending as their European cousins. Still, delusional voters are allowed into voting booths on election day. That means Barack Obama had better learn to channel Bill Clinton sooner rather than later-- and praise the glories of small government individualism while running a federal government whose debt is racing toward $20 trillion.
Chris Christie defies gravity | <paragraph>  Once upon a time, the Northeast was ruled by Republicans.  <paragraph>  Yankee politicians like New York's Teddy Roosevelt, Massachusetts' Henry Cabot Lodge, Connecticut's Prescott Bush, New Hampshire's Warren Rudman, Rhode Island's John Chafee, Maine's William Cohen and Vermont's James Jeffords represented more than a century of GOP dominance in the North that began with the presidency of Abraham Lincoln and ended with George W. Bush's election.  <paragraph>  So overwhelming was GOP dominance in New England that the Democratic Party failed to win a single presidential contest in Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine throughout the 1970s and 1980s. That reality shifted dramatically in 1992. In fact, Republicans in presidential contests have lost all states north of Virginia since 1988, other than Bush's single victory in New Hampshire in 2000.  <paragraph>  These bitter realities that face all Northeast Republicans makes New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's latest poll numbers all the more remarkable.  <paragraph>  As noted by Chris Cillizza's "The Fix", Christie’s 56 percent approval rating in a recent Fairleigh Dickinson University poll tops President Obama's standing in that state as well as the approval ratings of New Jersey's two Democratic U.S. senators. In fact, neither Bob Menendez nor Frank Lautenberg have ever registered an approval rating as high the one Christie currently enjoys.  <paragraph>  How terrifying it must be to Democratic activists in the Garden State that Republican Chris Christie is one of the most popular politicians in the recent history of their very blue state. The New Jersey governor just brokered a tough collective bargaining deal with his state's largest unions so you can expect those high approval ratings to continue for a while.  <paragraph>  There are many lessons for Republicans to take away from Christie's success:  <paragraph>  1. FOCUS ON MATH, NOT IDEOLOGY When you focus on fixing deficits by showing voters raw numbers, independents and editorial boards will follow you. When you follow your base blindly into ideological fights (like abolishing collective bargaining before your state is ready for that), you take unnecessary risks.  <paragraph>  2. THINK BIG Friends of Chris Christie never expected him to be a transformative governor. But candidate Christie knew that New Jersey's finances were so screwed up that if he got elected, his only option would be to throw all he had at knocking down the state's debt. Going to war was a risk, but his greater risk would have been to do nothing at all. As the Templar Knight at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade said, "He chose wisely." And as I always said to politicians who came to my office seeking advice, "Nobody ever stops you when you're going 90 miles per hour."   <paragraph>  3. BE YOURSELF Chris Christie is a Jersey guy. He ain't going to be invited to the Newport Debutante Ball anytime soon. And even if he were, he'd probably decline the invitation. That's because Chris Christie is an unapologetic street fighter who doesn't bother playing nice for the cameras.  <paragraph>  Sometimes he comes across as a bully. Sometimes he talks when he should be quiet. Sometimes he might even embarrass himself. But know this: Chris Christie is always himself. And for New Jersey voters, that's good enough.
Let the horse race begin |  <paragraph>  No sooner did Rick Santorum leave the Republican race for president than Gallup announced the start of its daily tracking poll. That means that every afternoon for the next 201 days, we will be greeted with horse-race updates that are sure to be followed by breathless headlines about how that day's results surely spell doom for President Obama or Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>  On this second day of Gallup's tracking poll, the survey was met with a screaming headline on The Drudge Report that yelled "SHOCK POLL!" So what's the earth-shattering news that deserved such a headline? It's that Mitt Romney leads the president by five points - 48% to 43%.  <paragraph>  Put as much stock in this poll as the ones that declared a few weeks back that the president was ahead of Romney by double digits. The next time you believe a result like that, step away from your laptop, get out of your mother's basement and take a walk around the block.  <paragraph>  Both campaigns will tell anyone who is listening that the Obama-Romney showdown will be decided in the final weeks of the campaign - with the outcome resting on unemployment rates, gas prices and their impact on swing states like Florida, Ohio and Virginia.  <paragraph>  So take a deep breath. We are still in the preseason for presidential campaigns. As the Boston Red Sox cruelly taught their fans again last season, winning big in the spring doesn't mean jack. It's how your side performs when the leaves start to change colors. Considering they still haven't sprouted throughout most of New England, this race still has a long way to go.
Let Mitt be Mitt... and dull |   <paragraph>  Mike Allen and Evan Thomas' "Inside the Circus" reveals that Mitt Romney's campaign team is still trying to figure out how to make their emotionally remote and fabulously wealthy candidate connect with voters.  <paragraph>  Team Romney has spent the past month or so trying to humanize their candidate with mostly disastrous results. Romney's poll numbers have taken a dive and his consistently poor performances have spooked conservatives like myself who can't believe this is the best the GOP has to offer after four years of Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Although he's a lousy politician, everyone who knows Mitt personally sees him as a great father, a devoted husband and a gifted businessman. If you spend a few minutes with the man's family, you can see his character shining through in his wife and five boys. But being a good man has not always translated well on the campaign trail. Perhaps this is because the business of politics is such an inhumane slog that only the craziest among us can look like normal human beings while going through the grind of a presidential election.  <paragraph>  Mitt can't fake it. He stinks at politicking. But then again, so did many others who would later succeed at governing. If Boston wants their candidate to humanize himself, maybe they should just let him admit that fact and stop trying to stuff himself into a suit that doesn't fit.  <paragraph>  So what should Mitt Romney tell Americans when he stops joking about his father shutting down plants or when he stops pretending to be a fan of "The Hunger Games"? Maybe he could start with the truth about himself.  <paragraph>  Mr. Romney should begin by talking about the proud legacy that his father passed along, the lessons he learned from a dad who began his life with little and ended up a legend in Michigan business and history.  <paragraph>  Then Mitt Romney should brag about starting a company that was wildly successful in turning businesses around, repairing failing companies and creating big profits for senior citizens, colleges, public unions, 401(k)s and anyone else smart enough to bet on Romney's company.  <paragraph>  Romney could then brag about leaving Wall Street to take on Teddy Kennedy in the Liberal Lion's own back yard. He should also admit to lurching a bit too much to the left while assuring conservatives that he will never make that mistake again.  <paragraph>  Team Romney should also remind voters that he saved the 2002 Olympics, not because he knew how to tell jokes or play "man of the people," but because Mitt Romney was born to fix things that are broken - like the U.S. economy in 2012. <paragraph>  Romney should then tell Americans how he was elected governor of one of the most liberal states in America despite being a conservative Mormon. Romney further succeeded politically when he managed to pull the Democratic legislature of Massachusetts as far right as politically possible. If President Romney is forced one day to govern with Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid, he can promise Americans that he will be more prepared to lead a divided nation than a certain former state legislator who voted present on the same kind of tough votes that required Governor Romney to build a majority.  <paragraph>  Mitt Romney should then just admit the sad truth. He's stiff. He's boring. He looks plain uncomfortable every time he tries to be cool. And despite what the love of his life may believe, he has never been the life of any party. But he may be the only leader on the national stage who has what it takes to fix an economy that's deep in debt, bleeding jobs by the year and suffering through 30 years of decline.  <paragraph>  Now is not the time to tell jokes. Now is the time to lead. So Mitt Romney, lead. And leave the bad jokes to Jay Leno.
A reporter's notebook... |  <paragraph>   To better serve you, the dedicated POLITICO blog reader, I travel the globe regularly to grasp the challenges facing other countries in hopes of improving our own. Like Thomas Friedman, David Ignatius and Nick Kristof, I know the big story never lands on a newsroom desk. That is why this weekend, I went on assignment in the most trying of circumstances.  <paragraph>   After arriving at the Lanesborough Hotel in Knightsbridge, London, I dug right in to my assignment despite the challenging surroundings. After having to call the butler TWICE to get the right Visconti pen to begin this posting, I soon became bored at the thought of writing anything so I ordered "Old School" on TV and called it a night.    <paragraph>   The next morning I began my journalistic journey in earnest and began studying the current British economic crisis, Prime Minister Cameron's response to that crisis, and how the Chancellor of the Exchequer's austerity program has impacted disposable income -- specifically, among English scousers who are also soccer fans. From the outset of my trip, I had hoped to challenge the preposterous assumption (repeated by absolutely nobody that I know) that the British economy is so bad that even rabid fans from Northern England would fail to make this weekend's trip to Wembley to see Liverpool win the League Cup in glorious style.  <paragraph>   Happily, my brutish slog across the pond was rewarded by the accumulation of massive evidence that British pensioners continue to spend their money on life's basics -- kegs of Carlsberg, graphic tattoos and overpriced futbol tickets. I even considered, albeit briefly, leaving my luxury box to interview the teeming masses but thought the better of it. Instead, I picked up a paper on the way to Heathrow this morning and was surprised by how closely the     <hyperlink>    current British crisis parallels our own. <paragraph>   “ In a stark warning ahead of next month’s Budget, the Chancellor said there was little the Coalition could do to stimulate the economy.  <paragraph>   Mr. Osborne’s bleak assessment echoes that of Liam Byrne, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, who bluntly joked that Labour had left Britain broke when he exited the Government in 2010.  He left David Laws, his successor, a one-line note saying: “Dear Chief Secretary, I’m afraid to tell you there’s no money left.” <paragraph>   "The British Government has run out of money because all the money was spent in the good years,” the Chancellor said. “The money and the investment and the jobs need to come from the private sector.” ”   <paragraph>   Whoever wins the 2012 election will be faced with the same reality when they are sworn in the following January. But the question for historians is whether this global economic crisis will be solved by President Obama's trillion dollar deficits or by Prime Minister Cameron's austere approach.  <paragraph>   My money is on Cameron. But at this point in the crisis, politicians on both sides of the political divide -- and on both sides of the Atlantic -- are whistling past graveyards. As the famous Hollywood saying goes, "Nobody knows nothing."
Tell Scarborough: Where do you stand on Afghanistan? | <paragraph>   With Afghanistan on the front pages of America's papers this past weekend, Morning Joe     <hyperlink>    started the week discussing the latest tragedies from that war-torn country and the need to bring our troops home. Watch the discussion below and let me know what you think by emailing me at     <hyperlink>    joeblog@politico.com or sending your thoughts via Twitter (    <hyperlink>    @joenbc).  <paragraph>   <video>
