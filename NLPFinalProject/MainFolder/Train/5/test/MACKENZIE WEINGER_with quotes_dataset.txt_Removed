Blitzer cameos in new Bond film 'Skyfall' | The name’s Blitzer. Wolf Blitzer. <paragraph> If you catch a screening of the new James Bond movie “Skyfall” this weekend, you’ll spot the CNN anchor making a brief cameo appearance early on in the film. Blitzer plays himself and delivers a crucial news report that spurs Bond into action on behalf of her Majesty's secret service. It's a small role, but crucial to driving the plot. <paragraph> “Daniel Craig, James Bond and Wolf Blitzer,” Blitzer said on Thursday’s show about his performance. “You’ll have to see it.” <paragraph> Blitzer asked his viewers to tweet him once they’d seen the film. <paragraph> “This acting thing, maybe I’ve got some potential,” he added. “You never know." <paragraph> He’s not the only CNN anchor with a movie out this month: Piers Morgan guests in the Denzel Washington movie “Flight,” which opened last Friday. Like Blitzer, the “Piers Morgan Tonight” anchor plays himself. Morgan tweeted on Thursday <hyperlink>about what he dubbed CNN’s “thespian war.” <paragraph> “So, I'm in the new Denzel movie #Flight and @wolfblitzer 's in the new Bond movie #Skyfall - both out this week. This is... #CNNthespianwar,” Morgan wrote. <paragraph> CNN did not have any additional comment.
NYT CEO faces more scrutiny from NYT | A legal letter about the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal is raising more questions about New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson’s knowledge of the spiked investigation into the BBC host, the Times reported Friday  <hyperlink>  <paragraph> . The Times’ Matthew Purdy wrote that in September, lawyers who represented Thompson and another executive “threatened to sue The Sunday Times in London” over a proposed article about the spiking of the “Newsnight” investigation into Savile. <paragraph> An aide told the Times that although Thompson authorized the letter, he was not aware of what the note detailed. Purdy wrote “interviews show that the letter included a summary of the alleged abuse, including the allegation that some abuse might have occurred at the BBC.” It also threatened “defamation proceedings.” <paragraph> “It’s not clear if he was shown it, but he doesn’t remember reading it,” the aide told the Times. <paragraph> The Sunday Times magazine article never ran, Purdy noted. Thompson did not comment to the Times for the article. <paragraph> Thompson, the former BBC director general who started his new job at the Times on Monday,has said he was not involved in killing the Savile investigation <hyperlink> . He has said he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being dropped, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011. <paragraph> “There were other moments during Mr. Thompson’s final months at the BBC — involving brief conversations and articles appearing in London news media — when he might have picked up on the gravity of the Savile case," Purdy wrote. "But the letter is different because it shows Mr. Thompson was involved in an aggressive action to challenge an article about the case that was likely to reflect poorly on the BBC and on him."
MSNBC weighs in on Karl Rove | <video>  MSNBC has weighed in on Karl Rove’s spat with Fox News co-hosts <hyperlink> over the network's decision to call Ohio for President Obama. <paragraph> MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow said Rove “is describing this as being just like 2000 and it is not over.” <paragraph> “I don’t mean to cross-advertise here, but on the conservative cable news network Fox News Channel – Fox News Channel called Ohio for Obama, but the on-air talent at Fox News Channel is refusing to concede that they believe it," she said. <paragraph> “Can you define that word ‘talent’ for the people who are not in this industry,” MSNBC's Chris Matthews jumped in. “They happen to have positions. It doesn’t say anything about their quality.” <paragraph> “People who are wearing makeup and have cameras pointed at them,” Maddow replied. "It's not everybody who's on Fox News tonight, but some of the people who Fox is putting on tonight are refusing to believe their own network’s call in the state of Ohio." <paragraph> Maddow added that Rove “is now trying to get on air the Fox News Channel to rescind its call in Ohio in favor of the candidate that he has bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. This is a remarkable thing.” <paragraph> NBC’s Chuck Todd called Rove’s reaction part of what will likely be seen from many Republicans — “it’s more than just a feeling of grief that they lost, they don’t believe it,” he said. <paragraph> “This goes to the larger point that I’ve been trying to make that there is going to be a big chunk of one of the two sides that was not going to believe they lost – it’s more than just a feeling of grief that they lost, they don’t believe it,” Todd said on MSNBC. “And I think you’re going to have a large chunk of the Republican base that doesn’t understand it. They’ve been told that the polls were skewed for week. They’ve been told for weeks there was something wrong with the polling and there was something wrong here and so that just makes it more difficult to govern. Let’s not pretend that it doesn’t.” <paragraph> Maddow also said Rove’s challenge is indicative of something that is happening on the right: “questioning what used to be basic agreed upon data.” <paragraph> “It’s worth looking at close races and I do not begrudge the Romney campaign for saying that they’ve got issues with what’s gone on with Ohio,” Maddow said. “But to decide that a result isn’t a result as long as you don’t like the outcome is something that means that we cannot work together as a country anymore. And we can’t go down this road very much further.” <paragraph> 
Roll Call names new editor | David Rapp will be the next editor of Roll Call, CQ Roll Call announced Tuesday. <paragraph> Rapp is heading to Roll Call from Bloomberg Government but previously worked at CQ as editor and senior vice president. He starts his new gig at Roll Call on Nov. 12, one day before the newly merged CQ Today and Roll Call publication is rolled out. <paragraph> “David comes to CQ Roll Call with a wealth of experience in publishing, particularly in digital strategy, and in creating innovative editorial products designed for people who rely on top-notch government information and analysis,” CQ Roll Call editorial director Susan Benkelman wrote to staffers in a note obtained by POLITICO. Benkelman noted that Rapp served as CQ’s first editor of new media, joined Bloomberg as ideas editor, and was editor in chief of Federal Computer Week. He left CQ in 2007 to start a business, TravelBeat.net. <paragraph> “In addition to this online experience, David has all the characteristics we need for the next editor of the new Roll Call: a track record of successful product redesigns and relaunches and a deep understanding of Congress, its community, the institution and its history,” Benkelman wrote in the memo. “He quite literally lives on Capitol Hill, and in the past 28 years he's come to know it as well as anyone in town. He also has an infectious enthusiasm for good stories, and is one of the most collaborative newsroom leaders I've worked with.” 
Larry King says Gary Johnson should have been on stage with Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama — but the libertarian presidential nominee’s only chance to debate comes during the third party showdown that King will moderate on Tuesday. <paragraph>  The talk show host, who is moderating the Free & Equal Elections Foundation’s independent candidate debate, said he thinks any candidate who is on the ballot in at least 40 states should be invited to all the major sanctioned debates. <paragraph>   “I would say if you’re on the ballot in 40 states, you should be in the debates,” King told POLITICO. “And Gary Johnson is, and therefore in my opinion he should have been in these debates. You’re on the ballot in 40 states, absolutely.” <paragraph>  King said he realizes the issues the debate commission and the TV networks would face if they invited every independent candidate — “I mean what are you going to do, are you going to have eight candidates on running for president?” <paragraph>  And King agreed to moderate the Tuesday event in order to give all the independent candidates “a voice” they’ve been denied thus far in the 2012 campaign, he said. For the independent candidates who have confirmed they’ll attend the Chicago debate — Johnson, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Constitution Party candidate Virgil Goode and Justice Party candidate Rocky Anderson — this is their sole chance to present their platforms to voters on a major stage. <paragraph>  Viewers can tune into the third party debate on Tuesday night at 8 p.m. EST on C-SPAN, Al Jazeera English and Russia Today, and streamed online at Ora TV and on the Free & Equal debate site. <paragraph>  “I think they deserve a voice,” King said of the third-party candidayes. “It’s obvious they’re not going to win, but in the Constitution it never says there’s a Democrat or a Republican Party. It never mentions a two-party system. We’ve had Federalist presidents, Whig presidents. … We’ve always had independent candidates. They deserve a voice and they haven’t had a voice in this campaign at all.” <paragraph>  But will King vote for one of the independent candidates he’ll question Tuesday night? <paragraph>  “No, this time around I will not vote for an independent candidate,” King said. “I never say who I’m voting for, but I think they should be heard, they have a right to be heard, they have issues that should be brought up. For example, the war on drugs has never been mentioned in this campaign. That’s an important issue.”  
Sandy crashes BuzzFeed, Gawker, HuffPo | Hurricane Sandy took down BuzzFeed, The Huffington Post, Mediaite and Gawker on Monday night as the storm ripped through New York City. <paragraph> Datagram — the Internet service provider these media groups use to host their websites — was flooded, causing the outage, an official told BuzzFeed last night. <paragraph>  “Basement flooded, fuel pump off line — we got people working on it now. 5 feet of water now,” the official wrote, according to BuzzFeed’s Tumblr <hyperlink> . <paragraph>  BuzzFeed, which is telling users today on its front page that it is “recovering from Sandy” as its main page isn’t updated, is using Tumblr, Twittter and Facebook to provide content. <paragraph>  BuzzFeed editor in chief Ben Smith wrote to staffers on Monday night that “we're having some hurricane related issues with our servers, but that shouldn't prevent us from getting up the great content we are trying to get up this evening. … We will, I hope, switch back to buzzfeed soon, but no point waiting.” <paragraph>  Meanwhile, The Huffington Post’s communications director Rhoades Alderson told Poynter <hyperlink> that “our data center, our backup data center, and its three data providers all failed overnight due to Sandy.” “The HuffPost and Aol tech teams are working closely with them to restore service. In the meantime, we’re redirecting to a simple Blogsmith page with all of our breaking news — one power vertical — until we’re back up,” Alderson wrote to Poynter. <paragraph>  On Monday, Gawker tweeted <hyperlink> the site was “temporarily down because the 57th Street Crane just flooded our servers with sea foam, or something. Back with you shortly” — but today,Gawker told readers  <hyperlink>via Twitter that “we're posting on old-school Gawker this morning while our server recovers from the storm. Come join: live.gawker.com.” <paragraph>  And Mediaite tweeted <hyperlink> to readers last night it was also temporarily down, but has had no further updates.  
CHC: NYT's Douthat 'reaffirms the obvious reasons' GOP lost Latinos | The Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Monday blasted The New York Times’ Ross Douthat’s new column as a "rambling piece which reflects his lack of understanding of the diverse Latino community and reaffirms the obvious reasons that Republicans lost Latino support.” <paragraph>  CHC chair Charlie Gonzalez took aim at Douthat for writing in his Sunday column “The Liberal Gloat <hyperlink> ” that one of the major reasons Democrats are winning the support of recent immigrants is “because those immigrants often aren’t assimilating successfully — or worse, are assimilating downward, thanks to rising out-of-wedlock birthrates and high dropout rates.” <paragraph>  “The Democratic edge among Hispanics depends heavily on these darker trends: the weaker that families and communities are, the more necessary government support inevitably seems,” Douthat wrote. <paragraph>  “Hispanics are not a separate part of America,” Gonzales said in a statement responding to the op-ed column. “We are engaged in every facet of American society and successful Latinos ensure a more prosperous America.  To say that Latinos are assimilating downward is to ignore the obvious facts.” <paragraph>  The Texas representative noted that “immigrants do not come to this country out of laziness. They come to work toward a better life and no one can question the work ethic of Latinos.” <paragraph>“Latinos seek assimilation, which requires equality with and inclusion in the dominant and established American community. The Republican agenda and policies offered neither and that's why Latinos voted for the Democratic candidates,” the CHC chair added. “The Latino story is the American story. It’s a simple lesson, but one that some conservatives, such as Mr. Douthat, are still learning.” <paragraph>  Douthat has not yet responded to a request for comment.   
McMahon won't release Social Security specifics... because of the media | Connecticut GOP Senate candidate Linda McMahon on Thursday said the media is the reason she has not released any specifics about her Social Security plan, saying that reporters “bash” and demagogue any proposals,  according to a report. <paragraph>  During Thursday’s debate with Rep. Chris Murphy, McMahon said she has not discussed specifics about her Social Security plan thanks to the press, CT News Junkie reported  <hyperlink>. <paragraph>  “I’ve not talked about specifics when I’ve been on the campaign trail because they get demagogued and you have no opportunity at all when you go in and put the issues on the table to discuss them,” McMahon said. <paragraph>  After the debate ended, McMahon doubled down on the charge, pointing out to reporters that she was referring to them in that statement. <paragraph>  “Thanks to all of you folks in the media, you’re the ones who primarily do it and bash any of the suggestions that might be made to improve the Social Security, Medicare,” she said, according to CT News Junkie. <paragraph>  McMahon’s office has not yet responded to request for comment from POLITICO.
