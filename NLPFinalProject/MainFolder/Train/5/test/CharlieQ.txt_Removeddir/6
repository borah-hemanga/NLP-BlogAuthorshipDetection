Hurricane Sandy: The political fallout |       <paragraph>     <picture>  <paragraph>   The widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy is going to have an effect on Election Day. The only question is how far-reaching it’s going to be. While some states escaped with far less damage than they feared, as many as 8.5 million residents across the Northeast were without power Tuesday — and a portion of them faced the prospect of an extended period of time without electricity.    <paragraph>   Here are six things to watch in assessing the storm’s political fallout:    <paragraph>   The popular vote The storm’s path along the Eastern Seaboard ripped across a wide swath of blue state America. The list of hardest hit states includes many of the states expected to deliver the biggest victory margins for the president this year — among them New York, which delivered a 2 million vote winning margin to President Obama in 2008.    <paragraph>   While the extent to which elections will be disrupted next week is unclear, the extensive power outages, flooding and wreckage from North Carolina to Maine are certain to have an impact on campaign ground games and could work to depress voter turnout in some places.    <paragraph>   That shouldn’t affect the electoral vote — New York, for example, will still deliver its 29 electoral votes to Barack Obama regardless of the damage to lower Manhattan — but in an exceptionally tight election, lower turnout in the most Democratic states increases the odds of a scenario where Obama wins the Electoral College but loses the popular vote.    <paragraph>   The Senate map The storm’s path cut through a handful of states with some of this year’s closest Senate races — among them Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia.    <paragraph>   While the Connecticut and Virginia races are open seat contests, Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown and Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey are running for reelection. As their home states begin the process of recovery, both incumbents have unique opportunities for free media and to connect with constituents — in an official capacity — at a time when many will be in need of local and federal assistance.    <paragraph>   The House map New York, which has suffered the highest death toll and where 2.3 million households were without power Tuesday, is one the prime House battlegrounds this year. There are as many as eight competitive races, most of them located south of Albany, where the bulk of the power outages have occurred.    <paragraph>   In New Hampshire, where the state’s two Republican incumbents are in danger of losing their seats, the state remains under a flood watch. But the Union Leader reported that “state utility regulators expect power companies to have all electricity restored by the end of the week, well before Tuesday’s general election.”    <paragraph>   The 2016ers Any number of the nation’s governors (or mayors) can attest to the leadership challenges of natural disasters and the powerful effect they can have on approval ratings — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is among those who experienced a post-hurricane spike in popularity after Hurricane Irene.    <paragraph>   The path of Hurricane Sandy means it will test a handful of governors with prospects beyond their home states — Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.    <paragraph>   With the nation watching, how they respond will go a long way toward establishing their home state narrative. But it will also provide a first impression to many voters outside their states whose introduction to them comes solely through glimpses of interviews and press conferences on cable and broadcast news.    <paragraph>   Maine’s electoral vote Maine is one of two states (the other is Nebraska) that allocates its electoral votes by congressional district. While the statewide vote is firmly in the Obama camp, local Republicans believe one of its two congressional districts is within Mitt Romney’s reach — raising the possibility that the GOP nominee could capture one of the state’s four electoral votes.     <paragraph>   It’s a longshot, for sure. But it’s worth noting that the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future recently reserved a significant amount of airtime in Maine television markets. While much of that was in the Portland market — and thus designed to bleed into New Hampshire — the buy also covered the northern-based 2nd District, which is where the GOP sees its opportunity.     <paragraph>   As a whole, the state was largely spared the worst of the storm’s damage. But the aftereffects of the storm were not evenly distributed — at least 60,000 customers were without power Tuesday afternoon, the bulk of them in the Portland area, not in the expansive 2nd District. It could very well mean nothing. But anything that could alter the equation in Maine in the final week of the campaign is worth keeping an eye on.     <paragraph>   A leadership test for incumbents If we’ve learned anything about the politics of natural disasters, it’s that careers can be made and unmade in the preparations and aftermath.    <paragraph>   Snowstorms, hurricanes, flooding, wildfires — they offer rare, unfiltered opportunities for elected officials to prove their mettle under pressure, and at a time of great need.    <paragraph>   The experiences of the Bush family alone sketch out the range of political consequences.    <paragraph>   In August 1992, FEMA’s disjointed response to the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew took its toll on President George H.W. Bush’s standing in Florida, which he managed to carry narrowly that fall but by a dramatically reduced margin over 1988. After three consecutive blowout GOP presidential wins there, Bush scraped to victory by just 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 39 percent — a 20-point GOP drop since 1988.    <paragraph>   His son Jeb Bush, the former two-term Florida governor, learned from the experience. His own hurricane preparation and relief efforts — 8 major storms hit the state in 2004 and 2005 — helped burnish his own reputation as a chief executive and bolster his popularity.    <paragraph>   Jeb Bush’s brother, President George W. Bush, failed to hit the same high mark as president. While his own Florida hurricane response efforts in 2004 were well received, his presidency never recovered from the administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
