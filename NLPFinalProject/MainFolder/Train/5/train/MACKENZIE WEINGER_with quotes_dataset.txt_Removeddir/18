AP, networks change exit poll strategy | TV networks and The Associated Press are changing their election night exit poll system in order to save money and account for increased early voting, according to a report. <paragraph> Exit polling will be limited in 19 states for the consortium of media organizations made up of the AP, ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News Channel and NBC, the AP reported <hyperlink>. The consortium announced that while it is reducing in-person exit polls, telephone polling will be increased this year in order to compensate for the rise in early voting and cell phone use. <paragraph>  “To save money this year, the consortium is doing bare bones exit polling in 19 states,” the AP's David Bauder wrote. “Enough voters will be questioned in those states to help predict the outcome of races, but not enough to draw narrative conclusions about the vote — what issues mattered most to women voting for Mitt Romney, for instance, or how many Catholics voted for Barack Obama.” <paragraph>  The AP notes that the affected states are Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming, as well as D.C. Some states that are not presidential battlegrounds will get a full exit poll, such as in the case of Massachusetts with its close Senate race. <paragraph>  The consortium did not release spending figures, according to the AP, but did announce it will interview 25,000 voters this year. In 2008, 18,000 voters were polled.
