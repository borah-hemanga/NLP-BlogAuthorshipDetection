MSNBC's Alex Witt rips Judd Gregg for bailing on interview | MSNBC’s Alex Witt told viewers Saturday that Judd Gregg ditched their planned interview when the network decided to show part of President Barack Obama’s speech live because he "didn’t want to listen to the president and wait through the duration." <paragraph> The host teased an interview with Gregg during her show “Weekends with Alex Witt,” saying that the former New Hampshire Republican senator and governor would join her shortly to discuss avoiding the fiscal cliff. <paragraph> “Will Republicans work with the president if he is re-elected? That interview is coming up in just a few minutes,” she said. <paragraph> Witt then ran through some top news stories and cut to a reporter covering the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York City. After the segment wrapped, the show went to commercial, and on its return, played about five minutes of Obama’s speech live. As MSNBC cut from the speech back to Witt, she announced Gregg had bailed on the show. <paragraph> “I wanted to let all of you know that we had teased the fact that former Republican senator and governor from New Hampshire Judd Gregg was going to speak with us,” she said. “I would like to let you know that he declined to stick around. He was plugged in, ready to go and he said he didn't want to listen to the president and wait through the duration to wait and speak with us.” <paragraph> "What just brings to mind for me is the possibility of spirit of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill when you have those kinds of sentiments being shared," she added. <paragraph>
