Paper reports McGovern dead, apologizes | The Sioux Falls Argus Leader apologized Thursday for posting a story inaccurately announcing that former Sen. George McGovern had died. <paragraph> The paper — in McGovern’s home state of South Dakota — said the story was accidently published on the Argus Leader website due to a technical error. <paragraph>  “A software company that searches the content of websites operated by the Gannett Corporation, including the Argus Leader, detected an unpublished story in the Argus Leader content management system and created a link to the McGovern story without permission,” the paper wrote <hyperlink> . “That link was automatically placed on an unrelated story today on the Argus Leader’s website, which a reader then posted to the social media site Twitter, which was seen and distributed by other users of Twitter and other social media sites.” The paper got in touch with the reader and the posting was deleted. The Argus Leader also deleted the story and had the link broken. <paragraph>  “Argus Leader Media apologizes to the McGovern family and our readers for this error,” the paper said. <paragraph>  McGovern’s family announced this week that the 1972 Democratic presidential candidate was admitted to a hospice in Sioux Falls, and his daughter Ann issued a statement Wednesday saying that the 90-year-old is “no longer responsive” in hospice care.
