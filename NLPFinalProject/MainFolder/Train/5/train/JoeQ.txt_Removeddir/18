The message of Jesus |  <paragraph>  With the holiest week of the year coming to an end, now is a good time to reflect on the message of Jesus that has been twisted in knots by televangelists and politicians in our time.   <paragraph>  Jesus is not about getting rich. He's about feeding the poor.  <paragraph>  Jesus doesn't care about putting your favorite politician first. He cares about you putting yourself last.  <paragraph>  He doesn't want you to listen to self-righteous televangelists or self-promoting politicians. Instead, he wants you to read his words and learn the truth. And for the purposes of those who read this column, Jesus never focused on politics. He remained silent on gay marriage, liberation theology or abortion wars.  But he did command us to love others, forgive others and serve others.  <paragraph>  Then he told us we should love others more than we love ourselves, that we should love our enemies, that we must turn the other cheek, that the peacemakers are blessed and that we must focus more on our own sins instead of judging the faults of others.  <paragraph>  And when Jesus' disciples asked what they needed to do to get to Heaven, his answer was simple: care for the poor, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, give water to the thirsty, visit those in prison and bring hope to the hopeless.  <paragraph>  That is a radically different message than the one we hear from popular culture and misguided ministers. But that message contained in Matthew 25 remains the heart of the Son of God's message 2,000 years after he rose from the grave.  <paragraph>  That's also a message that sinners like myself must always remember and be challenged by every day.
