Chicago books mayor for telling truth |  <paragraph>  Only Nixon could go to China, only Clinton could pass welfare reform and only Cory Booker could draw blood by  <hyperlink>  calling out Barack Obama. <paragraph>  That's because Republicans have called President Obama every name in the book over the past four years --from Marxist to fascist to racist. During that time, the right-wing noise machine spewed out such a steady stream of insults toward Mr. Obama that most swing voters simply don't pay attention to those howlers who keep crying wolf.  <paragraph>  Enter <hyperlink>   Cory Booker.  <paragraph>  The formerly fast-rising Democratic star and Obama surrogate went on "Meet the Press" Sunday morning to blast his candidate's populist attacks on venture capitalism. In so doing, the Newark mayor committed a terrible gaffe by Washington standards.  <paragraph>  He told the truth.  <paragraph>  Now he will surely pay a steep political price for his honesty. Never mind the fact that many of the big money contributors who made Barack Obama's historic election possible four years ago continue to practice the same brand of capitalism that made Mitt Romney rich. And many of those contributors are being asked once again to support Barack Obama's campaign.  <paragraph>  Cory Booker may have been forced to  <hyperlink> produce a hostage video last night, but it is Barack Obama who remains handcuffed today to the same big money capitalists that he still blames for ruining America.
