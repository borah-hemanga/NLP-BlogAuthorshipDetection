The war on Charlie Crist |   <paragraph>   <picture>  <paragraph>  As former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist looks more and more like a Democratic prospect for governor in 2014, the Florida GOP is ramping up its efforts to damage his political brand:  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  Tthe Associated Press: “ When Crist says something nice about President Barack Obama, the state GOP immediately shoots out a press release with something not so nice Crist said about Obama when he was a Republican. If Crist endorses a Democratic candidate, the party reminds people Crist used to say he was a Ronald Reagan Republican… “I just think Charlie Crist is bad for the state of Florida,” said state GOP Chairman Lenny Curry. “He’s someone who’s trying to recreate himself. These are serious times. At any level, we don’t want to see Charlie Crist back in office, particularly in a position of leadership. It wouldn’t be good for Florida, regardless of your ideology.” The idea is this: defeat Crist before he can re-emerge as a political candidate with a D next to his name. The unusual part is Crist isn’t a candidate and the attacks began before the 2012 election was decided. It breaks traditional election strategy for a party to begin airing campaign ads for the next election cycle while in the middle of another. “I don’t recall it ever being done,” said David Johnson, a Tallahassee-based Republican political consultant. “It is unusual and it is unprecedented, but so is Charlie Crist.” ”  <paragraph>  It’s hard to overstate the level of disdain many Florida Republicans have for Crist, so in one sense, the Crist-bashing isn’t a surprise.  <paragraph>  But there’s some risk in an over-the-top approach — the more the GOP attacks Crist, who hasn’t even registered as a Democrat yet, the more he could look like a sympathetic character to his prospective party.  <paragraph>  The track record for recent high-profile party-switchers isn’t great: Former Alabama Rep. Parker Griffith lost by a wide margin in a 2010 GOP primary following his switch from the Democratic Party, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was also rejected by his new party in a 2010 Democratic primary after he switched from the GOP side.  <paragraph>  There’s one big difference, though, between those party-switchers and Crist. Griffith and Specter both ran for reelection in the same election cycle that they switched parties, leaving them little time or opportunity to establish a trusting relationship with their new parties.  <paragraph>  Crist, on the other hand, will have plenty of distance from the Republican Party by 2014, and lots of time to do the necessary spadework with the Democratic grass-roots. By then, four years will have passed since he left the GOP. He’s already begun the process of generating political goodwill by supporting Democratic candidates and emerging as a prominent backer of President Obama — and by attracting the ire of the Florida GOP.
