Rendell: Casey hasn't run a campaign |   <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   As Democrats nervously eye the narrowing polls in Pennsylvania’s Senate race, reliably off-message former Gov. Ed Rendell offers a frank assessment of why Republican Tom Smith has closed the gap with Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr.    <paragraph>   From the     <hyperlink>    Times-Tribune in Scranton: “ “Casey? He hasn’t run a campaign. He’s run one ad, a stupid tea party ad,” Mr. Rendell said. “The tea party ad isn’t bad, but that’s all they’ve run. They’ve run a non-campaign up until now, and Smith has put a lot of money into the campaign. … You start spending money, that’ll change.” ”    <paragraph>   The race, which hasn’t been viewed as a top-tier contest, has undoubtedly gotten closer in the homestretch as Smith has poured millions into TV spots hammering the first-term incumbent. While Casey has led in every public poll taken this year — and at least two recent polls give him a double-digit edge — a handful of other surveys over the past two weeks put his advantage at 4 points or less.    <paragraph>   The Casey camp surely won’t appreciate Rendell’s analysis — delivered to the senator’s hometown paper — but it’s not surprising, given the long history the two pols share.    <paragraph>   Casey’s father defeated Rendell in the 1986 Democratic primary for governor; in 2002, Rendell returned to defeat the junior Casey in a bitter Democratic gubernatorial primary.    <paragraph>   By 2006, the two Democrats had established a working relationship: Rendell backed Casey in the 2006 Senate race. But two years later, they were on opposite sides again as Casey backed Barack Obama in the presidential primary and Rendell emerged as one of Hillary Clinton’s strongest supporters. <paragraph>   UPDATE: It's worth noting that, despite the criticism, Rendell still thinks Casey will win — and run ahead of the president. "If Obama ends up winning the state by 6 or 7 (points)," it's almost impossible for Smith to win. Without question," Rendell said in the same interview. "I think, in the end, Casey is going to run ahead of Obama. If Obama wins by 5, Casey wins by 7 or 8."
