A nation of partisans |   <paragraph>  More signs of deep political polarization, this time from the National Conference of State Legislatures, which reports a notable drop in the number of states with a governor of one party and at least one chamber of the legislature of the opposite party.  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  The Thicket blog: “ The 2012 election saw a significant decline in the number of states with divided government. It's the lowest number of states with divided government since 1952, when there were eight. This rivals our previously reported factoid that we have the lowest number of legislatures with split control (three) since 1944… The number of states with divided government peaked at 31 in 1988 and 1996. It has declined precipitously since 2004. ”  <paragraph>  Those results track with a September   <hyperlink>  Gallup survey that reported a record-high 38% of Americans prefer that the same party control the presidency and Congress, while a record-low 23% said it would be better if the president and Congress were from different parties.  <paragraph>  One way to read the Gallup numbers is to consider them an expression of frustration with divided government in Washington. But when viewed in combination with what's happening in the states, you could also look at it as a sign of growing intolerance among voters for the opposing party.
