Scott Walker's winning ways | <picture>  <paragraph>  Soon after the 2010 elections, Mika and I had a long dinner with David Axelrod about what went wrong for Democrats. During the dinner, a Republican operative walked over to our table and asked me to get up and visit the next table to meet the man who was just elected governor in Wisconsin. I walked over, met Scott Walker and immediately found myself unimpressed.  <paragraph>  Walker seemed too shy and too uncomfortable in Washington. I thought to myself that this was the kind of guy who gets swept into office during an ideological landslide and then gets booted out when the electorate moves back to the center a few years later. I saw that happen to many of my 1994 classmates. I saw it happen to Democrats who got elected in 2006. And I was pretty sure I would see it happen to Walker.  <paragraph>  Within a few months of his inauguration, I was sure of my prediction. Scott Walker quickly found himself in the middle of a political firestorm by moving too abruptly on union reform. Even though I was ideologically sympathetic to his cause, this looked like one more Republican leader who allowed himself to be painted as a right-wing extremist.  <paragraph>  I invited the governor on "Morning Joe" and immediately asked him if he had made a mistake moving forward too quickly on his agenda. His answer was a stunner.  <paragraph>  "Yes, I did."  <paragraph>  Then the governor started calmly explaining how he had failed to listen to enough of his constituents before moving against collective bargaining. This was coming from a leader who had just endured a barrage of nasty personal attacks from political opponents he had just crushed in the Wisconsin legislature. After thanking Scott at the end of what I expected to be a contentious interview, I turned to Mika and said, "Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong about that guy."  <paragraph>  Few politicians were so graceful in victory as Walker and even fewer learned from their mistakes as quickly as he did in 2011. That humility was on full display last night as Walker used his acceptance speech to thank God, lift up his family and praise his Democratic opponent while telling Wisconsin Republicans to work harder on bipartisan compromise. He even used his speech to admit again that he should have listened more before moving on union reform. The governor told his partisan followers that "more unites us than divides us" and that "now is the time to move forward together."  <paragraph>  After watching last night's victory speech, my opinion of the shy politician I met in Washington in 2010 changed again. I decided that Scott Walker just might be that rare type of leader who is able to move an electorate his way by being blessed with the perfect proportions of courage and humility.  <paragraph>  That was a winning formula in Wisconsin last night and could be the way forward for a party that has recently had the habit of unnecessarily provoking persuadable voters. Hopefully, the governor will learn to deal with all of the indignities Washington brings because his party and country may need him as part of a national ticket in the coming years.
