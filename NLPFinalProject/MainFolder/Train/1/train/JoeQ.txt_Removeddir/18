Economic help for Obama |   <paragraph>  The Wall Street Journal editorial page usually has little good to say about <hyperlink>  President Obama's economic agenda. But today's Journal was brimming with good news for a White House facing reelection during tough economic times. From front to back, the WSJ was filled with upbeat  <hyperlink>   economic news. Considering Friday's disappointing jobs numbers, the good news must have been a welcome respite for the White House.  <paragraph>  The paper's lead article showcased a study declaring that U.S. companies were emerging stronger from the Great Recession than they were even before the 2008 financial meltdown. The Journal quoted Wells Fargo's former chief economist who said the last few years have made U.S. companies "leaner, meaner and hungrier." That positive sentiment was backed by a WSJ analysis that showed sales, profits and employment higher among the Standard and Poor's companies than in 2007.  <paragraph>  That front page story was coupled with hopeful headlines from the Journal's opinion pages. Historian Walter Russell Mead's op-ed "The Myth of America's Decline" argued that, while power has become dispersed among more global players (  <hyperlink>  China, India,  <hyperlink>  Brazil, Turkey, Japan and Europe), the United States remains the "Chairman of the Board" on most global matters.  <paragraph>  Next to Mead's article was an opinion page headline asking "Who Deserves Credit for the Improving Economy?"  Even though the article warns of a coming fiscal cliff in 2013, most incumbents would put this op-ed under the "Just-Spell-My-Name-Right" category.  <paragraph>  If opinion writers spend the next year haggling over who should get the credit for America's improving economy, Barack Obama will be a happy man and Republicans will start planning for 2014.
