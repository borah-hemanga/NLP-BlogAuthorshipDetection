Bill O'Reilly: 'The white establishment is now the minority' | <video>  Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly said tonight that if President Barack Obama wins re-election, it’s because the demographics of the country have changed and “it’s not a traditional America anymore.” <paragraph> “The white establishment is now the minority,” O'Reilly said. “And the voters, many of them, feel that the economic system is stacked against them and they want stuff. You are going to see a tremendous Hispanic vote for President Obama. Overwhelming black vote for President Obama. And women will probably break President Obama's way. People feel that they are entitled to things and which candidate, between the two, is going to give them things?” <paragraph> “The demographics are changing,” he said. “It’s not a traditional America anymore.” <paragraph> (See also: 2012 election results map)  <hyperlink> <paragraph> O’Reilly said 50 percent of the voting public are people who “want stuff. They want things. And who is going to give them things? President Obama. He knows it, and he ran on it.” <paragraph> Twenty years ago, an establishment candidate like Mitt Romney would have trounced Obama, O’Reilly said. <paragraph> O’Reilly also criticized Romney for his response to Hurricane Sandy and said his campaign took “no chances” in recent days. <paragraph> “[Hurricane Sandy] just wiped the governor’s campaign off the map for five days. Five days Mitt Romney disappeared from the national debate and from the media headline,” O’Reilly said. “Now, it's interesting, because I told their campaign, and this is not self-aggrandizement, but I was speaking to some of the Romney people and I said do you have any idea that you are now invisible? Alright, no one is paying attention to you.” <paragraph> (PHOTOS: Election Day 2012)  <hyperlink> <paragraph> Obama, on the other hand, was seen out there trying to help victims, O’Reilly said. <paragraph> “I don't think that registered on the Romney people. But, in the exit polls tonight, that is a factor that President Obama looked bipartisan and presidential during that storm,” he said. <paragraph> And the Romney campaign coasted far too much on his debate performances in these last days, he added. <paragraph> “The strategy was we did better than we thought we were going to do in the debates. We're going to roll that into election day and take no chances,” O’Reilly said. “And that's exactly what the Romney campaign did. They took no chances. They didn't go on talk radio. They didn't go on national programs outside of football game interviews which mean nothing. They thought that they did well enough in the debates to roll in. And, you know what? They were right, except for Hurricane Sandy.”
