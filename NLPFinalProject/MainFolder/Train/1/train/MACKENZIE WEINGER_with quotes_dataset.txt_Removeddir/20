Sandy crashes BuzzFeed, Gawker, HuffPo | Hurricane Sandy took down BuzzFeed, The Huffington Post, Mediaite and Gawker on Monday night as the storm ripped through New York City. <paragraph> Datagram — the Internet service provider these media groups use to host their websites — was flooded, causing the outage, an official told BuzzFeed last night. <paragraph>  “Basement flooded, fuel pump off line — we got people working on it now. 5 feet of water now,” the official wrote, according to BuzzFeed’s Tumblr <hyperlink> . <paragraph>  BuzzFeed, which is telling users today on its front page that it is “recovering from Sandy” as its main page isn’t updated, is using Tumblr, Twittter and Facebook to provide content. <paragraph>  BuzzFeed editor in chief Ben Smith wrote to staffers on Monday night that “we're having some hurricane related issues with our servers, but that shouldn't prevent us from getting up the great content we are trying to get up this evening. … We will, I hope, switch back to buzzfeed soon, but no point waiting.” <paragraph>  Meanwhile, The Huffington Post’s communications director Rhoades Alderson told Poynter <hyperlink> that “our data center, our backup data center, and its three data providers all failed overnight due to Sandy.” “The HuffPost and Aol tech teams are working closely with them to restore service. In the meantime, we’re redirecting to a simple Blogsmith page with all of our breaking news — one power vertical — until we’re back up,” Alderson wrote to Poynter. <paragraph>  On Monday, Gawker tweeted <hyperlink> the site was “temporarily down because the 57th Street Crane just flooded our servers with sea foam, or something. Back with you shortly” — but today,Gawker told readers  <hyperlink>via Twitter that “we're posting on old-school Gawker this morning while our server recovers from the storm. Come join: live.gawker.com.” <paragraph>  And Mediaite tweeted <hyperlink> to readers last night it was also temporarily down, but has had no further updates.
