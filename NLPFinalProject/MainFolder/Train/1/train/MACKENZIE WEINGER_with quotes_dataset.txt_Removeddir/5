Kristol: 'Mistake' to fight over Bush tax cuts | The Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol on Monday said it would be a “mistake” if Republicans pick a fight on the expiring Bush tax cuts and added that the party needs to “get it out of the way so we can fight about tax reform.” <paragraph> “It’s President Obama’s proposal, he ran on it, let him implement it. If things slow down, it’s his fault. And that’s fine with me, and I hope things don’t slow down because I hope we get real tax reform in 2013,” Kristol said Monday night on Fox News’s “Special Report” with Bret Baier. “But I just think picking the fight right now on the expiring Bush tax cuts is a mistake.” <paragraph> Kristol said he hopes the Republican Party caves on this now so “we can fight about the big deal that has to happen next year.” <paragraph>  “The Bush tax rates expire on Dec. 31,” he said. “Rates are going up for everyone, if nothing happens. If you think Republicans can win a showdown on preserving all the current Bush tax rates against a president who was just re-elected and gained seats in the Senate and House on just raising rates on millionaires, well, good luck. I prefer this as a policy outcome. I don’t think it’s winnable. I think at the end, Republicans will cave.” <paragraph>  The Weekly Standard editor noted that the four fastest years of economic growth in the last 30 years were under Ronald Reagan when the top marginal tax rate was 50 percent. <paragraph>  “Honestly, 35 to 39 percent, by itself, is not going to cripple the economy,” Kristol added. <paragraph>  Kristol first expressed his support of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire on Sunday. <paragraph>  "The leadership of the Republican Party and the leadership of the conservative movement has to pull back, let people float new ideas. Let's have a serious debate," Kristol said on "Fox News Sunday <hyperlink> ." "Don't scream and yell if one person says 'You know what? It won't kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires.' It really won't, I don't think." <paragraph>  "I don't really understand why Republicans don't take Obama's offer to freeze taxes for everyone below $250,000, make it $500,000, make it $1 million," Kristol added on Sunday. "Really? The Republican Party is going to fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires, half of whom voted Democratic and half of whom live in Hollywood?"
