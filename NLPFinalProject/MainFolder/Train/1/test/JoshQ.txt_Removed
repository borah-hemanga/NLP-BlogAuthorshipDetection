Judge sets hearing in Ohio provisional-votes fight |  <paragraph>  A federal judge has set a hearing for Wednesday morning—the morning after Election Day—to hear arguments about the rules for counting provisional ballots in Ohio.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Court Judge Algenon Marbley set the 11 A.M. Wednesday session in Columbus via an order issued Monday afternoon and posted   <hyperlink> here.  <paragraph>  Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted issued a directive Friday that requires voters to complete the identification section on provisional ballots, rather than pollworkers. A variety of unions, a homeless-aid group and the Ohio Democratic Party say having voters fill that out themselves could lead to inaccuracies or errors. The labor groups and Democrats have asked Marbley to order the state to count provisional ballots even if that identification information is incomplete.  <paragraph>  "Since this suit bears on Ohio’s conduct of the November 6, 2012 election, it is appropriate to deviate from the Local Rules in order to expedite the briefing schedule and timely resolve the question. The timing is particularly sensitive given the need for Defendant Husted and the State of Ohio to issue instructions to election officials in conformity with this Court’s decision prior to the counting of provisional ballots," Marbley wrote in Monday's order.  <paragraph>  Marbley gave Ohio authorities until the end of the day Tuesday to file any written opposition to the plaintiffs' demand.  <paragraph>  The judge appears to view the matter as not of such urgency as to require action before Election Day because the relief the plaintiffs' are seeking is not to change Husted's order to pollworkers regarding who fills out the ID information, but rather the question of which ballots will ultimately be counted.  <paragraph>  Under Ohio law, the provisional ballots cannot be officially tabulated before Nov. 17th.
In pitches to troops, presidential candidates dodge and weave |  <paragraph>  In lobbying U.S. military personnel for their votes, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney sounds quite different than he did in the most recent debate, while President Barack Obama doesn't seem to want to square up with a key critique of his policy in Afghanistan.  <paragraph>  The Obama and Romney campaigns recently answered questions submitted in writing by Stars and Stripes about issues the independent, partially-federally-funded newspaper considered most of concern to soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, as well as veterans.  <paragraph>  The   <hyperlink> Romney camp's answer to Stars and Stripes on Afghanistan is striking for its contrast with what the GOP hopeful said at the foreign policy debate on Monday and in a foreign policy speech earlier this month. In the statement released to the military audience, Romney branded Obama's decision to announce a withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014 as "an enormous mistake."  <paragraph>  "Gov. Romney believes it was an enormous mistake to communicate a withdrawal to our enemies as it makes our transition mission more difficult," the statement sent to Stars and Stripes said. <paragraph>  If Romney believes that was an "enormous" error, it's odd he didn't mention it during the debate or during his speech at the Virginia Military Institute, where he alluded in vague terms to Obama decisions some people disagree with and warned against a politically-timed retreat, all while endorsing the 2014 timetable.  <paragraph>  In the debate, Romney seemed to drop his earlier talk of a 2014 withdrawal being dependent on conditions on the ground. "We'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014....We're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point," Romney said, sounding as certain of an on-time withdrawal as Vice President Joe Biden did in his debate and more certain than Obama does, aside from this weekend off the reservation.  <paragraph>  The   <hyperlink> Obama camp's answers to Stars and Stripes also included their share of sophistry, dodging a key question about the public pull-out timetable: "Does the plan give enemy fighters an incentive to lie in wait until the U.S. leaves?" None of the sentences the Obama team provided responds directly to that point. There's also no direct response to whether the president is concerned that attacks on U.S. soldiers by Afghan personnel could so disrupt training that a successful transition could be jeopardized.
Parsing Obama on Guantanamo | <paragraph>  What exactly did President Barack Obama mean when he suggested Thursday that Congress needs to do more to establish a "legal architecture" to govern aspects of the war on terror?  <paragraph>  "One thing we have got to do is put a legal architecture in place and we need congressional help do that to make sure that not only am I reined in, but any president's reigned in, in terms of some of the decisions that we’re making," Obama told Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's "Daily Show."  <paragraph>  Obama made the comment just after he mentioned Guantanamo, so it seemed he may have been referring to some type of legislation to regulate the detention of war on terror prisoners. The remark echoed something the president said more than three years ago, in   <hyperlink> his only speech he devoted to the issue as president.  <paragraph>  "If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.  And so, going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution," Obama said in May 2009.  <paragraph>  If that's what the president was talking about Thursday, it's a bit perplexing because the Obama administration  <hyperlink> decided later in 2009 not to pursue such legislation, even though   <hyperlink> officials determined that 48 of the men at Gitmo needed to be held indefinitely without trial.  <paragraph>  In August 2010,  <hyperlink> Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) filed a bill that would have had Congress set some rules for the process of long-term detention of alleged terrorists. The administration, which had been   <hyperlink> negotiating intensely with Graham months earlier, didn't take a position on the measure, which essentially went nowhere.  <paragraph>  Last year, Congress passed a bill that appeared to give its general endorsement to the procedures the courts have worked out to review the detention of Guantanamo prisoners. Obama initially   <hyperlink> threatened to veto that measure, but   <hyperlink> relented after it was watered down. He also signed that and several other measures that effectively made it impossible for him to carry through on his plan to close Guantanamo.  <paragraph>  Throughout the discussions last year, administration officials signaled that they would have preferred Congress not dig into the issue. However, Obama may have been alluding to hopes some in the administration had early in their talks with Graham that a "grand bargain" might have been possible that would have combined closing Guantanamo with passing detention-related legislation. Those hopes were well dashed by last year and officials seemed uninterested in engaging on detailed detention-related legislation with Congress so stridently opposed to closing Guantanamo and bringing some of its prisoners to the U.S.  <paragraph>  It's conceivable Obama's comment to Stewart was about legislation to give a legal imprimatur to surveillance President George W. Bush untilaterally authorized. But that doesn't make a great deal of sense. Congress passed such legislation in 2008, while Obama was still a senator. Obama's Thursday comments were clearly directed at some kind of unfinished business with Congress.  <paragraph>  It's also possible the president was referring to legislation to regulate the process by which the U.S. authorizes the use of lethal force against individual terrorists abroad, particularly Americans. But the administration has insisted that the internal, secret process the White House, Defense Department and Central Intelligence Agency use to make those kinds of decisions is adequate to the task and has resisted efforts to involve the courts. In fact, Obama suggested later in the interview that a "legal structure and safeguards" were in place on that front. <paragraph>  The White House didn't immediately respond to a query late Thursday seeking more detail about what kind of "legal architecture" Obama wants Congress to put in place relating to terrorism.  <paragraph>  Here's an extended excerpt of the 'Daily Show" exchange: “Obama: There are some things that we haven't gotten done. I still want to close Guantanamo. We haven’t been able to get that through Congress. one thing we have got to do is put a legal architecture in place and we need congressional help do that to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in in terms of some of the decisions that we’re making. There are tough tradeoffs. Sometimes there's bad folks on the other side of the world and you have to make a call and it's not optimal but when you look at our track record what we've been able to do is to say we ended the war in Iraq, we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, we've gone after Al Qaeda and its leadership. it's true Al Qaeda's still active, at least sort of remnants of it, are staging in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Sometimes you have to make tough calls but you can do so in a way that's consistent with international and American law. Stewart: Within that as it ratchets down, i think people have been surprised to see the strength of the Bush-era warrantless wire-tapping laws and those types of things not also be lessened. The strictures that he put in place tthat people might have thought were government overreach and that maybe they had the mind you would perhaps tone down, you haven't. Obama: Well, the truth is we actually have modified them and built a legal structure and safeguards that are in place. That weren't there before on a whole range of issues Now, they're not real sexy issues... Stewart: You don’t know what I find sexy.”
Alito speaks up for Asian Americans | <paragraph>  When the Supreme Court took up the issue of Affirmative Action in higher education Wednesday for the first time in nearly a decade, Justice Samuel Alito seemed to be particularly focused on the program's impact on Asian Americans.  <paragraph>  As lawyer Greg Garre sought to defend the University of Texas's Affirmative Action program, Alito asked about an unusual aspect of the school's racial preference system: it actually seeks out African Americans and Latinos who are privileged socioeconomically and provides a boost in the admissions process.  <paragraph>  "You specifically have the example of the child of successful professionals in Dallas...If you have -you have an applicant whose parents are -- let's say they're — one of them is a partner in your law firm in Texas, another one is a part — is another corporate lawyer. They have income that puts them in the top 1 percent of earners in the country, and they have — parents both have graduate degrees. They deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely average in terms of education and income?" Alito asked.  <paragraph>  "No," Garre insisted. "We want minorities from different backgrounds. We go out of our way to recruit minorities from disadvantaged backgrounds," he said, apparently alluding to another program mandated by state law that admits the top 10 percent of each high school class—effectively admitting a large number of Latinos and African Americans.  <paragraph>  Later, Alito returned again to the issue of whether Asian Americans were being treated fairly in the admissions process.  <paragraph>  "In terms of diversity, how do you justify lumping together all Asian Americans? Do you think — do you have a critical mass of Filipino Americans? Cambodian Americans?" Alito asked.  <paragraph>  "The common form that's used has Asian American, but also, next to that, has a form that says country of origin where that can be spelled out," Garre replied.  <paragraph>  "But do you have a critical mass as to all the subgroups that fall within this enormous group of Asian Americans?" Alito asked.  <paragraph>  "Your Honor, we've looked to whether or not we have a critical mass of underrepresented minorities, which is precisely what the Grutter decision asks us to do," Garre said.  <paragraph>  Alito was arguably the most forceful and argumentative challenger of the Texas program among the justices at Wednesday's arguments. Affirmative action is apparently a subject matter he's had an interest in for some time. At his confirmation hearings in 2006, it emerged that when applying for a job in the Reagan Administration in 1995, Alito listed himself as a member of Concerned Alumni of Princeton, a group whose members expressed concern about rising numbers of women at the university and also challenged some of the school's Affirmative Action practices.  <paragraph>  At his hearings, Alito said he had no recollection of involvement with the group, but may have joined because of its work to support the presence of ROTC military officer training on campus.  <paragraph>  A full transcript of Wednesday's oral arguments is posted   <hyperlink> here.
Guantanamo prisoner returns to Canada |  <paragraph>  The United States sent to Canada Saturday morning a Guantanamo prisoner who was born in Canada and captured in Afghanistan at the age of 15, announced the Department of Defense.  <paragraph>  Omar Khadr, now 26, was shot in a battle with U.S. Special Forces in Afghanistan in 2002. He was charged with war crimes, including the murder of a Special Forces medic, though some experts expressed doubt about the legality of charging one combatant in a military encounter with killing another barring some sort of unusual circumstances. Khadr's age also complicated the case and drew criticism of it from international human rights groups.  <paragraph>  In 2010, Khadr pled guilty to the charges as part of a plea deal that called for him to serve eight more years in custody, but allowed for his transfer to Canada after a year and included no guarantee of how long he would actually be confined after returning to Canada.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> The Star report notes that Khadr can apply for parole next summer. However, a senior administration official told POLITICO that Khadr will serve out the sentence imposed by the U.S. military commission at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  "We do not provide details of security assurances, but we did have extensive discussions with the Canadians about the way ahead for Khadr. He will be incarcerated and serve out the remainder of his sentence," said the U.S. official, who asked not to be named in discussing the diplomatic discussions.  <paragraph>  Khadr was picked up at Guantanamo before dawn Saturday and was being flown to Canada, the news reports said.  <paragraph>  Khadr's transfer and the recent death of another detainee leave the public count of prisoners at Guantanamo at 166.  <paragraph>  UPDATE (Saturday, 9:05 A.M.): This post has been updated with comment from the U.S. official and to note that Khadr is likely to serve at least some additional jail time in Canada.
Feds: Hide SEAL name given to Hollywood |  <paragraph>  Last July,  <hyperlink> a top Pentagon official gave two Hollywood filmmakers the name of a Navy SEAL involved in training the squad of commandos who carried out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Now, the Obama administration is fighting to keep that same name from the public.  <paragraph>  In legal papers filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, the Justice Department argued that the government is under no obligation to make public the SEAL's name or the names of Central Intelligence Agency personnel involved simply because officials shared their names, partial names or identities with the makers of a forthcoming movie about the raid, "Zero Dark Thirty."  <paragraph>  "The CIA and DoD did not authorize the filmmakers to make the names they shared with them public, to publicly associate the individuals with the CIA or DoD, or to expose those individuals’ identity in any publicly released film, and there was no reason for the CIA or DoD to have believed that any of this would have happened," the Justice Department brief says. "In fact, [Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Mike] Vickers specifically told [filmmaker] Mark Boal, in providing him with the name of someone he could talk to, that 'the only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any way as a consultant.'"  <paragraph>  "This limited disclosure of the names to the filmmakers does not make the information 'truly public' under the public domain doctrine," DOJ lawyers argue. "The filmmakers were not authorized to release the names publicly, and the names have not, to our knowledge, been released to the public."  <paragraph>  The brief (posted   <hyperlink> here) was filed in a lawsuit the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed against the Defense Department and CIA seeking disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act of records about government cooperation with Hollywood's effort to bring the bin Laden raid to the big screen.  <paragraph>  The dispute over the names puts journalists in an awkward position. Press advocates generally favor broad disclosure under FOIA and a narrow reading of exemptions the government uses to hold back information requested under that law. However, journalists are often privy to the names of officials providing background briefings and sometimes are given sensitive or classified information on condition it not be disclosed. A strict rule that what's given to any outsider must be given to all could wind up restricting journalists' access to that kind of information.  <paragraph>  Generally, the government can't use exemptions from FOIA to withhold information it has officially disclosed elsewhere. However, for the government to lose its right to withhold the info, the previous disclosure has to be essentially identical (which usually makes the whole fight pointless) and part of some permanent public record.  <paragraph>  In the "Zero Dark Thirty" case, the Justice Department contends that even if the government released the name or names in question, it's irrelevant because the whole "public domain doctrine" doesn't apply in cases where personal privacy is at issue. However, the government did not cite any appellate cases in the D.C. Circuit to support that position. <paragraph>  A Pentagon spokesman told POLITICO  in May that while the filmmakers were offered the opportunity to meet with the SEAL raid planner, the meeting never took place. <paragraph>  "Zero Dark Thirty" is slated for release on Dec. 19.
Another death at Guantanamo | <paragraph>  A detainee at the prison for terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay was found dead at the facility on Saturday, the U.S. military said in a statement Monday.  <paragraph>  The statement from the U.S. Southern Command did not say precisely where the prisoner was found, but said he was discovered by guards "conducting routine checks."  <paragraph>  "Guards found the detainee unconscious and unresponsive. The guards immediately performed first aid and summoned medical personnel to the scene. The corpsmen provided emergency medical treatment and quickly transported the detainee to Naval Hospital Guantanamo. After extensive lifesaving measures had been performed, the detainee was pronounced dead by a physician," the SOUTHCOM statement said.  <paragraph>  The statement also offered no information on the prisoner's nationality, age or name. Military officials said the prisoner's identity was "being withheld pending notification of the detainee's government and family."  <paragraph>  In accordance with standard procedures, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is looking into the cause and circumstances of the prisoner's death, the statement said.  <paragraph>  According to the last public count, there were 168 war-on-terror prisoners at Gitmo. The number of live prisoners now appears to stand at 167.
Press outlets protest Manning trial secrecy |  <paragraph>  More than 30 news outlets and media organizations lodged an official protest Tuesday against secrecy in the court-martial of Pvt Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst accusing of leaking hundreds of thousands of military reports and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.  <paragraph>  The amicus brief filed with the military's highest court, the Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces, supports a request from the Center for Constitutional Rights to allow public access to motions, briefs, written rulings and the docket in Manning's court-martial.  <paragraph>  While hearings in Manning's case have been in large part public, the motions and briefs the prosecution and defense are arguing about are not available from the court. So, those watching the arguments often have trouble understanding precisely what the lawyers are arguing about.  <paragraph>  "This Court should find that such an arrangement is unconstitutional," lawyers Gregg Leslie and Kristen Rasmussen wrote in the brief, which was joined by POLITICO and parent company Allbritton Communications Co. "The inability to view court documents filed in connection with a particular judicial proceeding burdens the news media’s constitutionally protected right to collect and disseminate the news and severely curtails journalists’ ability to do their jobs effectively."  <paragraph>  The brief (posted   <hyperlink> here) also notes that in a tough economic environment, documents may be essential to journalists' ability to report on the case, particularly one as drawn out as that of Manning, who was arrested in May 2010 and currently has a trial date in next January.  <paragraph>  "Public court records, namely the various legal arguments and requests by parties and their counsel contained in the documents, enable journalists to tell the full story, despite the fact that deadline pressures or shrinking news staffs may drastically limit their ability to attend a lengthy judicial proceeding in its entirety," the media brief says.  <paragraph>  Others signing onto the brief included The Associated Press, Atlantic Media, Dow Jones, Gannett, Hearst, CNN, McClatchy, The New York Times, The New York Daily News, Reuters, the Washington Post, The Tribune Co. and The Washington Post.  <paragraph>  Military prosecutors have urged the court to reject the request for direct access to the court-martial filings. Prosecutors say the public can seek to access the records through the Freedom of Information Act, although that process is almost always untimely and the military has flatly rejected past request for Manning related records. <paragraph>  Manning's defense counsel David Coombs has published some filings on his blog, but the prosecution and the judge have forced him to delete the substance of the prosecution's argument along with the names of virtually all individuals other than Manning mentioned in the documents.  <paragraph>  The brief also points out an odd irony: while legal filings in the miltiary commissions trying alleged Al Qaeda members are — after significant lobbying by the media — published on a military-run website, filings in the highly newsworthy court martial of an American soldier are unavailable to the press and public through official channels.  <paragraph>  Court filings in federal civilian court cases are almost always immediately and directly available to the public and press through an electronic docketing system. The Supreme Court has found a common-law right of access to court records and many courts have found a First Amendment right to such records in most circumstances.  <paragraph>  Military courts have recognized a defendant's constitutional right to a public court-martial since at least the 1980s, the media brief says. And the Army Court of Criminal Appeals found a "qualified" First Amendment right of access to court-martial exhibits in 1998.  <paragraph>  In March, media groups sent Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson a letter seeking access to the Manning court-martial filings. Johnson, who was instrumental in setting up online access to the Guantanamo military commission filings, has not responded to the letter.
