Chicago Chicanos ‘Read Out’ in Solidarity with Tucson | <PARAGRAPH> Books can save your life. <PARAGRAPH> Especially if you are growing up in a rough area, faced with discrimination, racism, poverty, violence and a dominant culture that seems to belittle your family’s history and your very existence. <PARAGRAPH> That’s how celebrated author and community leader Luis J. Rodriguez described his youthful relationship with books. Growing up in a tough L.A. neighborhood where a gang attack left him with a damaged chin at age 11, Rodriguez was a young heroin addict and gang member. He eventually left that life and became an internationally-known writer, artist and youth advocate. The shift started with a book of Mexican murals given to him by a counselor who was also a Chicano activist with the radical Brown Berets. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Now, Rodriguez’s books are among those banned from public school curriculums in Tuscon, Ariz. as part of an attack on Mexican American studies by the city’s school board and a state law. On Sunday, at the Taller Mestizarte gallery in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, Rodriguez read from one of his own books and spoke about the larger importance of books dealing with politics, Chicano culture and popular movements. <PARAGRAPH> There was much attention last year to the removal of a long list of book titles from Tucson schools after the school board became afraid that ethnic studies violated a 2010 state law prohibiting courses “designed primarily for pupils of one ethnic group” that “advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals” or promote “resentment toward a race or class of people.” In These Times covered the efforts of Tucson student activists to organize their own ethnic studies classes, as well as a month-long “No History is Illegal” campaign to incorporate the banned Mexican American studies curriculum into classrooms across the country last February. <PARAGRAPH> But Chicano, Latino and other activists and educators in Chicago feel that the issue has now dropped off the public radar. They fear that attacks on free speech, education and ethnic studies will spread around the country if people don’t continue to fight the Tucson school board. <PARAGRAPH> That’s why Rodriguez – who previously lived in Chicago and founded Tia Chucha Press here – joined local artists, activists, students and teachers in the small Pilsen gallery to read from books on Tucson’s banned list. Appropriately, the event was held on 18th Street in Pilsen, a hotbed of Chicano organizing in decades past. <PARAGRAPH> Rodriguez remembered how, along with receiving the book from the Brown Beret, “an Anglo teacher opened up the world of books for me.” He also recalled how librarians would watch him with an eagle eye, suspecting he intended to steal books. At an independent bookstore owned by a Jewish-American man in his own rough neighborhood, Rodriguez said the owner would “watch me not because he thought I would steal but because he wanted to see what my interests were.” <PARAGRAPH> While homeless and living beside the Los Angeles River, Rodriguez would stow books in little “cubby holes” and other secret spots. “Books, man!” he reiterated. “They save your life … This is why the battle in Tucson is important.” <PARAGRAPH> On the gallery walls between bright abstract paintings were cardboard signs reading, “Save Ethnic Studies” and “History is not Illegal.” <PARAGRAPH> Antonio Zavala, one of the Pilsen event organizers, invoked Ray Bradbury’s famous Fahrenheit 451 as a cautionary tale. He paraphrased the Tuscon school board members’ contentions that the Chicano and other ethnic studies programs teach hatred toward Anglos and foster an “us versus them” environment. <PARAGRAPH> “They want to promote this idea that ‘Just work hard and you’ll make it,’” he said. “But that’s a big fallacy – just look at the African American community, they’ve worked hard through so many conditions and they’re still looked on as second class citizens … This is a designated attack on the rights of Mexican Americans and their culture and right to education.” <PARAGRAPH> Two participants read from Laura Esquivel’s book Like Water for Chocolate, pointing out the important cultural symbolism and mocking the fact that the school board saw such tales of food and desire as threatening. <PARAGRAPH> “What do they have against chefs … what do they have against love?” asked participant, after reading stanzas from the book. After reading a fragment about “punish[ing] Tita for her willfulness,” she said, “Ah! Maybe that’s it, willfulness.” <PARAGRAPH> Another participant read from 500 Years of Chicano History, pointing out that she could see why it might be seen as threatening in a state rife with anti-immigrant and racist dynamics…and that is all the more reason to make sure students have the chance to read and discuss the material. She pointed out how “Anglos put the label of bandit on our resistance heroes.” Several others read from Paoulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed and from Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States. <PARAGRAPH> The next step for Tucson organizers will be a three-day “Tucson Freedom Coalition” convergence in November, where they hope to unite a national movement around the battle for ethnic studies in Arizona. <PARAGRAPH> Dr. Teresa Cordova, director of the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said at Sunday’s event, “I had the opportunity to go to the university because of the Chicano movement…So I always felt like my education was not my own but belonged to the community.” <PARAGRAPH> “One of the reasons they’re afraid of the Pedagogy of the Oppressed is the idea of using education as a way for people to understand the context under which they live and the possibility for transforming it,” Cordova continued. “That we are not just victims but agents of transformation.”
Lawsuit Sheds Light on Murky and Dangerous Warehouse Sector | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Working In These Times has frequently covered the warehousing industry and the way that complicated layers of different companies using, owning, operating and staffing warehouses make the sector ripe for labor abuse. <PARAGRAPH> A motion for sanctions filed August 23 in a workers’ class action lawsuit against southern California Wal-Mart warehouses sheds more light on this structure and alleges that defendant Schneider Logistics failed to provide legally mandated evidence to avoid culpability for workers’ wages and working conditions. <PARAGRAPH> Last October, workers affiliated with the group Warehouse Workers United filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. district court in California alleging labor law violations at Mira Loma warehouses operated solely for Wal-Mart stores. The lawsuit names Schneider Logistics Inc. (SLI) and its subsidiary Schneider Logistics Transloading and Distribution (STLD) along with the companies Impact and Premier, which hired people to staff the warehouses. Schneider took over operation of the warehouses in 2006. <PARAGRAPH> The initial complaint said: <PARAGRAPH> Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated to recover the wages that defendants stole — and are continuing to steal — from them in violation of federal and California law. Plaintiffs also seek redress for other consequences of defendants’ unlawful conspiracy, including defendants’ wrongful scheme to hide and then cover up the extent of their wrongdoing by failing to keep mandatory payroll records, falsifying records of hours worked and compensation owed, and concealing, denying and/or misrepresenting to the workers the amount of their earnings and on what basis these earnings were calculated. <PARAGRAPH> A key question is whether Schneider or STLD directly employed--and is therefore responsible for the working conditions of--the plaintiffs, including lead plaintiff Everardo Carrillo. The plaintiffs allege that Schneider is their “joint employer” along with the other defendants. <PARAGRAPH> Schneider Logistics initially argued that it had “no connection with or responsibility for the operation, oversight, or supervision” of the workers at the Mira Loma warehouses, as quoted in the recent motion. It notes that Schneider Logistics Secretary-Treasurer Amy Schilling signed a sworn declaration saying the company had “no business or contractual relationship” with co-defendants Impact and Premier. And the motion alleges that Schneider sought to continue this image by failing to turn over documents during the discovery process that would have indicated otherwise. <PARAGRAPH> In April Schneider attorneys responded to a discovery request without actually looking for the requested documents, according to the motion. In other words, they allegedly were either sloppy or intentionally avoided turning over evidence to which the plaintiffs have a legal right. <PARAGRAPH> This became clear when documents turned over by Impact and Premier included highly relevant Schneider documents which Schneider attorneys had specifically said did not exist. The motion notes: <PARAGRAPH> Schneider has now produced thousands of documents it previously claimed did not exist, including over 12,100 pages of personnel files it maintained for the Impact and Premier class members (whom it claims not to jointly employ), and the workplace rules and training requirements it imposed on all class members. <PARAGRAPH> The plaintiffs say the new documents show that “Schneider’s top managers knowingly made material false statements” to the court, including claims that the warehouse employees are not subject to Schneider employment policies and that Schneider does not keep personnel files on them or set productivity quotas. The documents showed that Schilling herself signed contracts with Premier and Impact, on behalf of STLD and “its affiliates.” Meanwhile, Schilling is also vice president and controller of Schneider National, the parent company of the other Schneider groups, which actually negotiated the contracts with Impact and Premier. <PARAGRAPH> Once it was clear that Schneider did indeed have contracts with Impact and Premier, General Manager Vince Redgrave told the court that the contracts gave Schneider no say over work terms or conditions. The court ordered that Schneider actually produce the contracts, and when it did, as the motion says, “they proved the exact opposite of what Vince Redgrave had testified.” <PARAGRAPH> The federal district judge, Christina Snyder, wrote in a preliminary injunction ruling that the “contracts dictate nearly every material term of plaintiffs’ employment including how Impact and PWV (Premier) must conduct pre-employment screening and new employment training.” <PARAGRAPH> The documents also showed that, contrary to Redgrave’s previous testimony, Schneider did set specific productivity quotas for the warehouse workers and in fact complained to Premier when the rate of cases unloaded per hour dropped. Schneider officials also talked about how to remedy Impact’s “low productivity levels.” <PARAGRAPH> Warehouse worker groups have long argued that unrealistic and escalating productivity quotas are among the things that lead to high chronic and acute injury rates in warehouses. In July, Warehouse Workers United filed a complaint with California’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration office. <PARAGRAPH> The recent motion also alleges that Schneider or its attorneys did not order employees to preserve emails relevant to the case, as is standard required legal procedure. It says the company has an automatic delete email function for emails from the Mira Loma warehouses, meaning emails are deleted automatically after a short period of time, and employees also have “absolute discretion” over whether to save or delete emails. The motion says Schneider was slow to issue a memo instating a “litigation hold”—meaning employees should preserve relevant communications. And it alleges even after such a memo was issued, Schneider never enforced it. <PARAGRAPH> The motion also alleges that Schneider destroyed and denied the existence of security camera footage that would aid the plaintiffs’ case. The motion demands that Schneider turn over video footage and also a log of any video that has been destroyed since October 2011. <PARAGRAPH> The motion asks that the court make note of Schneider’s alleged misconduct, tell Schneider that further misconduct will result in sanctions, and provide relevant attorneys’ fees and costs to the plaintiffs. It notes that the court could also decide to inform a jury of Schneider’s false statements and other discovery violations, and asks that the court establish a “rebuttal presumption” that Schneider is indeed a “joint employer” of the plaintiffs. <PARAGRAPH> Overall, the lawsuit is part of WWU’s and individual workers’ ongoing campaign to improve conditions in warehouses and shed light on the complicated employment structure that allows major companies like Wal-Mart to benefit from the low-paid, dangerous work of a largely temporary workforce.
Not-For-Profit Hospitals Make Billions—and Provide Little Charity Care | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Not-for-profit hospitals, including some of the country’s biggest and best-known institutions, are almost entirely tax exempt, in part because of the expectation they will provide free or low-cost “charity care" to those in need. But a report released this week by a research arm of California Nurses Association / National Nurses United found that California not-for-profit hospitals are reaping huge tax benefits while providing minimal charity care. <PARAGRAPH> Many people don’t realize that not-for-profit institutions can accumulate profits. They can; the profit cannot be disbursed to individual owners or stockholders but rather is supposed to be reinvested for the good of the community. With hospitals, that is generally assumed to include the provision of charity care to uninsured or low-income people. But while 11 states, including Texas and Alabama, mandate specific levels of charity care, California and the federal government do not. <PARAGRAPH> As a result, not-for-profit tax breaks for well-known California hospitals–including Cedars Sinai, Kaiser Permanente and Stanford University--dwarf the level of charity care provided. Overall, the 196 hospitals surveyed received $3.3 billion in 2010 state and federal tax exemptions and spent only $1.4 billion on charity care--a gap of $1.8 billion. Three-quarters of the hospitals got more dollars in tax breaks than they spent on charity care. Half spent less than 2.46 percent of their operating expenses on charity care. <PARAGRAPH> The tax breaks hurt financially strapped counties and towns; according to the report, California counties and municipalities lost about $1 billion in tax revenue they would have otherwise collected in 2010. Public budgets suffer when large institutions don’t pay taxes, and budget crunches are often taken out on public workers, as well as those who rely on the services they provide. Counties or cities also end up essentially picking up the tab for health care when impoverished patients can’t pay and hospitals either deny care–diverting the patients elsewhere–or insist on billing. The report notes that California counties and towns paid $450 million in 2010 to for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals for care for people who could not pay their medical bills. <PARAGRAPH> All of these spillover effects concern National Nurses United, whose mission includes patient advocacy and "accessible, quality healthcare for all." Spokesperson Chuck Idelson told In These Times, “Nurses see what happens to their patients and their communities when these giant corporate hospitals behave more like Lehman Brothers or JP Morgan than a community service. For example, Sutter Health has engaged in widespread slashing of mental health services, women’s services, children’s services–cuts that will make them profits." <PARAGRAPH> The nurses' union proposes California legislation that would force not-for-profit hospitals to beef up their charity care if they want to maintain their tax exemptions. It wants hospitals to spend at least 8 percent of revenues on charity care, echoing a proposal made by the state attorney general in 2006. The nurses are also demanding more transparency in how hospitals report and define their charity care, to exclude the "promotional activities or cost containment (interpreted by many hospitals as cutting services)" that are currently counted. Violations of charity care obligations could be punished by fines and/or the revoking of tax exempt status. <PARAGRAPH> To those who wish to support NNU's efforts, Idelson says, "You can contact your legislator to insist they pass legislation, and tell the non-profit hospitals to cease their practices of putting profits and executive pay over charity care." <PARAGRAPH> While California relies more heavily than most states on not-for-profit hospitals, which take in 70 percent of California patients, the nurses union says that similar situations exist nationwide. In 2004 I wrote for the Chicago Reader about the religious, not-for-profit chain Advocate denying charity care to people in need–billing them for their care, and then suing them and garnishing their wages when they couldn’t pay bills that were actually larger than insured people would have been given for the same service. <PARAGRAPH> Earlier this month scores of union nurses, in their trademark red garb, attended the release of a report by the state auditor on charity care. At the hearing, State Board of Equalization member Betty Yee noted that not-for-profit hospitals actually often provide less charity care than for-profit institutions. <PARAGRAPH> Many for-profit hospitals have taken a hit during the economic crisis, in part because of rising numbers of uninsured and desperate patients whom they are legally obligated to treat. (One exception, as The New York Times reported this week, is the HCA chain owned by Bain Capital, which has made huge profits largely through cutting services and staffing.) <PARAGRAPH> Idelson stressed that the debate shouldn’t be about the merits of for-profit versus not-for-profit health care systems, but rather public versus private ones. “If you look at the level of charity care and other community benefits and pricing practices, the difference between private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals is very small," she says. "But the difference between private and public systems is massive. The institutions that are really acting in a way people think hospitals should behave are the hard-pressed county and public hospital systems.” <PARAGRAPH> Idelson noted that while the union’s recommendations are necessary for the immediate future, the overall crisis just underscores the need for revamping the country’s entire private, profit-based health care system. <PARAGRAPH> “No one should have to worry about getting access to medical care. You should not see services arbitrarily cut because they are not profitable services. In the long term the only solution is transforming our healthcare system into the type most countries have–which is a national single-payer system.”
Making Health Care Reform Work: A Perspective from California Doctors | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> LOS ANGELES—At a conference convened by the organization Reporting on Health at the University of Southern California this week, doctors and health care experts shed light on labor-related aspects of the health care field as the sweeping health care reform legislation is set to take effect after being upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. <PARAGRAPH> They provided a window into the workplace stresses and challenges doctors themselves have faced in our tumultuous and trouble-plagued health care system, and also the health care needs and challenges of low-income workers. <PARAGRAPH> Marcia Sablan, a doctor in the tiny northern California town of Firebaugh, embodies both of these narratives. Marcia is one of many doctors who depended on a federal program that helps people afford medical school in exchange for working in under-served rural districts. After her residency at the University of Hawaii, she was assigned to Firebaugh, in the agricultural valley of Fresno County, with a population then of just over 3,000. She was accompanied by her husband, also a doctor and the first native of Saipan to graduate from a U.S. medical school. <PARAGRAPH> Panelists at the conference noted that such programs will be increasingly important if the government wants to encourage more doctors to go into general primary care rather than becoming specialists. Specialists make an estimated $3.5 million more over their lifetimes, yet there will be an estimated shortage of 30,000 primary care doctors in coming years especially as more people become insured under the new health care law. <PARAGRAPH> Sablan arrived in Firebaugh in 1981 and eventually founded her own private practice there, where she primarily serves low-income Latino farmworkers, about half of them immigrants, including many uninsured people who may or may not end up insured under the health care bill reforms. Doctors and experts at the USC conference echoed the widespread concern that due to the way the health care reform bill and Supreme Court decision played out, people living under the poverty line may not get insurance under the new law. That’s because the insurance exchanges and subsidies the law mandates are designated for people who make more than the poverty line, while people making below the poverty line (including childless adults —a change from the past) are all supposed to be covered by Medicaid. <PARAGRAPH> States are ordered to expand their Medicaid programs to cover people making up to 133 percent of the poverty line, but the mandate doesn't have strong teeth since it is unclear if or how the federal government can punish states that don't expand their Medicaid programs to cover the newly eligible people. Many states say they cannot afford their share of the expansion plus the extra costs expected when currently eligible but un-enrolled people “come out of the woodwork” thanks to the publicity around the reform law. <PARAGRAPH> Sablan notes that she never asks her patients about immigration status—she is not required to under California’s Medicaid law—and she typically charges a $50 fee which most patients pay out of pocket. <PARAGRAPH> “Undocumented workers know not to leave a trail, not to leave bills,” she said. <PARAGRAPH> But when her patients need specialty care, the seasonal nature of farm work can cause serious problems. Many of them do have insurance during the months they are employed, but not during the off-months, she said. In her early years in Firebaugh, many of the locals were migrant workers living in labor camps who returned to Mexico or otherwise left Firebaugh for half the year. But the labor camps have been demolished and now many farmworkers have bought homes and live year-round in the town with their families, even as they continue to depend on seasonal agricultural wages. Hence an illness or injury that keeps them away from work for days or weeks during the crucial seasonal employment period is especially devastating financially. <PARAGRAPH> “What does an agricultural-based seasonal economy mean to a doctor practicing there?” Sablan asked, noting that Firebaugh’s population now numbers 6,741: 88 percent Latino, 22 percent living below the poverty line, more than a third unemployed and almost two-thirds without a high school diploma. “It means people have insurance and Medi-Cal (California’s version of Medicaid) at certain seasons of the year. But we know diseases don’t work like that. So this is a huge problem for us—seasonal workers have a very difficult time keeping up with chronic diseases.” <PARAGRAPH> From a health perspective, Sablan is glad to see the valley’s once-thriving cotton industry decline, she said, since it involves heavy pesticide use that raised serious health problems for workers and other residents. Once she treated victims of what was known as the worst pesticide-poisoning case in state history—28 workers critically poisoned after being ordered to return to a field too soon after it had been sprayed with phosphates. Now almonds and pistachios are the main crops in the area, grown mostly by huge industrial farms. (Meanwhile a sustainable cotton project has been in the works.) <PARAGRAPH> Sablan hopes the health care reform law will indeed result in better preventative care for low-income and currently uninsured people. She cites the case of one patient, a 54-year-old farmworker who had a heart attack and was prescribed medication which, at $400 a week, he could never afford. Also suffering from diabetes and lacking medication, he eventually had another heart attack and ending up needing permanent dialysis by age 60. <PARAGRAPH> “When you think about the Obama plan, think about [the farmworker] – do we want to be upstream or downstream?” in health care spending, she asked. “Someone paid for him to be in the hospital two times and on dialysis, which costs about a million dollars a year. He’s totally disabled now, unable to work, from what should have been a preventable situation.” <PARAGRAPH> Despite such challenges, Sablan and her husband feel lucky to work in an environment where they have treated three generations of patients —it gives them a sense of personal connection and continuity that other doctors say they lack when forced to see up to 30 patients a day, in the common “fee for service” health care model. <PARAGRAPH> Dr. Ken Kim described the challenges of working in a typical profit-driven, urban system. He and other internists were disgusted to see how badly many of their patients were faring under the standard health care model. He described multiple diabetic patients with legs amputated because they were shuffled between specialists, waiting for months for appointments, while a “pin-sized” wound became infected and festered. And he described elderly patients unable to comply with a doctor’s orders because they lacked a ride to the clinic or couldn’t open medicine bottles with arthritic hands or ate high-sodium meals as shut-ins. Doctors and nurses want to help such patients with personalized care, he indicated, but the fee-for-service model and other aspects of the traditional insurance system create so much time pressure that patients fall through the cracks. <PARAGRAPH> So Kim and other doctors formed an “accountable care organization” (ACO) wherein insurance companies like Blue Cross pay the organization a flat fee to provide care for a certain group of the insurance companies’ enrollees. Kim said that after floundering at first, the company, CareMore, where he now serves as chief medical officer, was able to provide holistic, preventative care to a patient base of mostly ailing senior citizens by subverting the fee for service model, focusing on prevention and making sure the various nurses and doctors working with a given patient communicate and develop a cohesive plan. He said that under their organization rates of hospital readmissions, amputations, mortality and other indicators have decreased drastically. Many hope this type of accountable care organization will become more common under the health reform law. <PARAGRAPH> While the general public is obviously confused about the implications of the health care reform bill, doctors and health care experts are also uncertain about how the law will play out and what it will mean for their own work lives and those of their patients.
Our Kind of (Torturing) Town Journalist John Conroy’s first play chronicles a police brutality scandal in Chicago. | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Dan Breen seems to undergo a diabolical transformation as he speaks from the podium. The wise-cracking garrulous police officer who collects old coats for the homeless takes on a chilling fascistic visage as his speech crescendos: “God bless Jack, God bless you and God bless the city of Chicago!” <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile Otha Jeffries undergoes a transformation of his own before our eyes, from a sensitive if rebellious boy to a man pulsing with violence and rage, handcuffed but ready to burst “like a bomb” in his mother’s words, kicking over chairs and foaming at the mouth with impotent anger. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries and Breen are characters in My Kind of Town, a riveting play by veteran Chicago journalist John Conroy depicting the police torture scandal that he spent two decades chronicling. It plays through July 29 at the TimeLine Theatre in Chicago. <PARAGRAPH> Conroy’s stories for The Chicago Reader, including 1990’s “House of Screams,” told horrifying tales of African American men subjected to suffocation, electric shock and other certifiable torture meant to induce confessions under the watch of Vietnam veteran Jon Burge. Conroy’s dogged reporting helped bring to light the systematic and racist injustice that people at all levels of power, including then-state’s attorney and former Mayor Richard M. Daley, seemed determined to ignore. <PARAGRAPH> But as the scandal might otherwise be fading from public consciousness a year after Burge was sentenced to federal prison (on counts of obstruction of justice and perjury), the play confronts viewers in a way more visceral and raw than is possible in newsprint. It lays bare the multiple layers of pain, suffering, terror and despair meted out to men and their families by the coldly calculated methods of obtaining near-100 percent “clearance rates” in homicides at the Area Two police district. <PARAGRAPH> Breen (not a real name) is a Chicago cop under the Burge-like figure Jack Gunther, who never actually appears on stage. As played by David Parkes, Breen is a rich character with a trademark Chicago accent who exemplifies the line toed by Burge and his supporters: that police in the city’s toughest districts were dedicated servants doing what it took to protect African-American communities from bloodthirsty gangsters and thugs. Breen’s aforementioned speech is at a fundraiser for Gunther, who, like Burge did in real life, flees to Florida after the department has finally fired him. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries is a composite of a number of real men who were allegedly tortured by Burge or his underlings, some of them later released from prison after their convictions were deemed wrongful. <PARAGRAPH> Conroy came to write the play “almost by accident,” after a local producer suggested the scandal would be perfect for the stage. “I didn’t want anybody else to do it so I said yes,” he says. Though he had decades of reporting under his belt, including books about 1980s Belfast and about the police torture, Conroy had never written a play. <PARAGRAPH> “I didn’t know what I was doing, that’s why it has nine characters,” he says, noting the original draft had 13. “But I didn’t want to write a two- or three-character play. I really wanted to indict the city, and I couldn’t do that with two or three characters.” <PARAGRAPH> The play does indeed indict Chicago—the culture of political corruption, racism, segregation and cronyism which allowed the House of Screams to flourish—while at the same time it manages to celebrate the city with spot-on references to north side-south side rivalries and video clips of historic events like the 1967 Big Snow that briefly bridged racial divides. <PARAGRAPH> The sin of looking the other way is embodied in the fictionalized composite state’s attorney Maureen Buckley, who is demoted to the city hall basement after asking too many questions but nevertheless stands up for her “tribe” when it comes to the witness box. Conroy plumbs the complicated social dynamics that can arise when families are torn apart by violence, poverty and incarceration. He paints Jeffries’ parents as disturbingly but understandably ambivalent about their son’s release from prison, given his mental breakdown—“something snapped,” his mother says—and the danger he likely poses and faces if he is released. <PARAGRAPH> “I speculated that was something I might feel if my son had gone crazy, he might be homicidal or suicidal,” Conroy says. “It was actually something that came from Northern Ireland, where I met mothers who said, ‘I’m glad my son is inside because at least he won’t get killed there.’” <PARAGRAPH> Conroy says writing a play was much different from journalism, and he had to struggle to “divorce himself” from strictly portraying the facts. “I had it in my mind the script should be faithful to certain things and one of those was the years,” he notes, but director Nick Bowling eventually convinced him of the importance of condensing a complicated chronology down to two discrete time periods. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries (played with stunning intensity by Charles Gardner) throws viewers for a loop at the end of the play—SPOILER ALERT!—with a cryptic comment indicating he may be guilty after all. Conroy says this twist was Bowling’s idea to add more drama, and he initially balked. “I felt like he’d kicked me in the gut, and Nick said that’s exactly the response we want from the audience. It boils down to the question of is it right to torture anybody regardless of what they’ve done?” <PARAGRAPH> With Burge in prison, most of the officers and prosecutors linked to the scandal (including Daley) retired or deceased and a number of tortured men released from prison, the torture scandal could be fading into the past. But Conroy is adamant that should not happen, and he hopes his play will help keep alive this history and an ongoing struggle for justice. <PARAGRAPH> “There are still a dozen guys in prison on the basis of suspect confessions,” he says. “All they’re asking for is a new hearing, but they’re having to fight this battle on their own. Everyone now knows this torture took place at Area Two, so what does it cost society to examine this small group of cases? Not much! It needs to be done. It’s immoral not to give them a new hearing.” <PARAGRAPH> He adds that people tortured at Area Two who have finished their sentences still cannot seek compensation, since the statute of limitations on filing a civil suit expired long before the evidence of systematic torture came to light. And Conroy notes that the code of silence is still alive and well in the department, as evidenced by the city’s refusal in recent years to release the names of officers with multiple misconduct complaints. A majority of city councilors have demanded such records to help root out “bad apples” and relieve taxpayers who are subsidizing millions of dollars in legal settlements against these officers, but the city has resisted. <PARAGRAPH> “Burge did not act alone,” Conroy said. “It’s good there’s been some public recognition in terms of one guy going to prison. But what about the other 30? The system has not changed.” <PARAGRAPH> Conroy never meant to become so focused on a single, ongoing investigation, he says, and he sometimes regrets that he became so publicly associated with that story to the exclusion of his other journalistic interests. But knowing that people’s lives were literally on the line, he couldn’t back off. After the tumultuous changes in the journalism industry Conroy is no longer working as a staff journalist, and it is unlikely today that any Chicago reporter would be paid to cover an investigative story to the dogged extent Conroy did. It makes you wonder what injustices may be occurring now without journalistic scrutiny. For his part, Conroy is focusing  less on the foreclosed possibilities of journalism, and more on liberating potential of theater. <PARAGRAPH> “You can do something in theater that you can’t really do in journalism, which is point the finger at the broader society,” he said. “How everybody looked the other way and no one cared.”
Black Days for the Irish Economy | <PARAGRAPH> TULLYCROSS, IRELAND—Ten days after Irish citizens voted to ratify the proposed European Union fiscal austerity treaty, the sense of resignation about the gloomy economic situation seems heightened, especially in light of recent news that the vote will not mean an imminent re-entry to bond markets. Meanwhile, some expect Spain's bailout will make Ireland's prospects even worse. <PARAGRAPH> In a May 31 referendum, voters approved the treaty 60 to 40 percent, with voter turnout at about 50 percent. For the treaty to take effect, 12 Eurozone ccountries need to ratify it—a condition still in doubt given opposition in Greece, France and other countries. <PARAGRAPH> The treaty says a country's deficit cannot exceed 0.5 percent of its GDP; in 2011, Ireland's deficit equaled 9.4 percent of its GDP. Still Ireland has been considered the "poster child" or "good boy" for compliance with austerity measures previously mandated in order to receive bailouts—measures that treaty opponents blame for Ireland's 14 percent unemployment rate and ongoing economic stress. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Opponents—most notably the nationalist party Sinn Fein—had accused proponents of using fear to push for a yes vote, and they said that, contrary to treaty proponents' rhetoric, loans and bailout funds would still be available had voters refused the treaty. <PARAGRAPH> Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the treaty and Ireland's participation are key to European economic recovery and stability. But the days after the vote did little to bolster citizens' confidence and were described as an embarrassment for Kenny after his promises that a yes vote would ease woes. Credit agencies, including Fitch, announced that, despite the vote, Ireland's credit rating would not be upgraded and its ability to re-enter the bond markets remains unclear. <PARAGRAPH> Some had hoped that the yes vote would lead to a deal that would reduce Irish bank debt that taxpayers are mandated to repay, but Merkel and the European Central Bank denied that possibility. <PARAGRAPH> "This lady Merkel is just crazy about money," the owner of a pub, store and inn on a rural road in County Mayo told me, noting his business has suffered greatly since the economy crashed. He thinks Ireland's compliance with austerity measures from the 2008 Lisbon Treaty did nothing to help, in the face of crippling bank debt. "They should just wipe the slate clean and start all over again, let us have a boom for another 20 years." <PARAGRAPH> A number of people I talked with described the crippling levels of debt that most residents live with, even as the country appears relatively prosperous. <PARAGRAPH> "It's a facade, like a movie set," said the owner of a bed and breakfast in the town of Westport. "People started building two and three houses, and now they can't pay for them ... so many were put up so fast they are terrible quality." <PARAGRAPH> Indeed, there are many spacious, upscale large houses standing empty or unfinished throughout the lovely countryside, though it appears they are largely never-lived-in second homes or upgraded homes not carrying the specter of painful foreclosures and families thrown out on the street. <PARAGRAPH> It seems unclear to everyone exactly what the economic future holds, but residents do not feel optimistic and think they will get a raw deal under the fiscal treaty. On the social media politics site, Political World, one participant wrote: <PARAGRAPH> "If the Irish government could grow some balls in the very short week ahead, and close ranks with others in the same boat, they might learn a trick or two and possibly even get somewhere. [T]hey should know by now that trying to be teacher's pet isn't working. [T]hey're not even getting a pat on the head anymore." <PARAGRAPH> Leaders on both sides of the treaty debate have invoked the importance of the free market, with treaty proponents saying a no vote would kill private investment and opponents saying private investment—in pharmaceutical manufacturing, information technology and the like—would continue even if Ireland refused the treaty. But there was bad news on the jobs front in the days after the vote. <PARAGRAPH> Pfizer  announced it would cut 177 jobs at two plants in County Cork, and the major public-private bus company Bus Éireann revealed plans to slash allowances, sick days, and holidays for 2,500 workers in an attempt to reduce payroll costs by €9 million annually and save €20 million annually. <PARAGRAPH> Another large bus company, Dublin Bus, announced similar cuts, and Irish Rail announced 450 voluntary redundancies. Bus Éireann said fuel costs and the loss of €6 million in state subsidies necessitated the cuts. The National Bus and Rail Union promised a standoff, saying the union would not accept the cuts. <PARAGRAPH> As for Pfizer, the Irish Independent quoted SIPTU union shop steward Gerry Sharma  saying: "The mood is very somber at the moment. Pfizer is a very good company to work for and these kinds of jobs won't come around again. There are a lot of people being made redundant who would have big mortgages and the jobs market is very bleak at the moment. It's just another black day in the Irish economy."
Will More Austerity Work for Ireland? | <PARAGRAPH>  ALLIHIES, IRELAND—Life appears peaceful and idyllic on the famous green hills above white-capped seas and plunging cliffs on Ireland’s west coast. Woolly sheep graze on impossibly steep slopes; people chat inside prim pubs, walk dogs along ancient stone walls or tend immaculate gardens outside cute cottages. Aside from a scattering of vacant newish McMansion-style homes, there are no obvious signs of the economic distress that has clutched the country since the "Celtic Tiger" economic boom crashed and burned several years ago.  <PARAGRAPH>  But Ireland is indeed hurting economically, and the country is now center stage in the bitter controversy over how to ease Europe’s economic woes and decide the economic future of the European Union. On May 31, citizens will vote on whether to accept the European Union austerity treaty that played a significant role in recent political upheavals in France and Greece. Proponents say the treaty is essential to Ireland’s economic future, including its ability to get international loans and bailouts and attract private investment.  <PARAGRAPH>  <PICTURE>  <PARAGRAPH>  Opponents, including the Sinn Fein party, say the treaty would curb the country’s chances for economic growth and job creation, and sacrifice Ireland’s independence. "Austerity Isn’t Working – Stand Up for Ireland," read the "Vote No" banners along narrow country roads in coastal villages between the River Shannon and the Berea peninsula. In larger towns and cities in the region like Tralee and Ennis, "Yes" banners saying "Integrity, Stability, Recovery" and "Working for Ireland" far outnumber "No" banners.  <PARAGRAPH>  Contrary to some Irish pundits who indicate that the referendum’s results are up in the air and that Irish citizens may say "no," people I talked with over a week along the western coast feel that the treaty’s ratification is inevitable. Opinions varied on whether or not the treaty is actually a good thing for Ireland.  <PARAGRAPH>  An innkeeper on a tiny harbor on the Berea peninsula, where sheep and mussel farming are the main economic activities, is angry and exasperated that regular citizens have to pay for the malfeasance of politicians and big banks who got Ireland into its current dilemma. She thinks people will suffer because of the austerity measures, but she says the government is dead-set on passing the treaty and she believes it will get its way. A cab driver in Ennis said, "It has to pass; we don’t have a choice." The proprietor of a gift shop in the bustling town of Killarney plans to vote "no," saying, "We’ve given enough away already. You don’t get out of a recession that way."Sinn Fein politicians, including party president Gerry Adams, have been holding town hall meetings around the region – advertised on hand-lettered posters saying "all welcome" – to drum up support for a "no" vote. They are framing it as part of the party’s Defend Rural Ireland Initiative, and they stress that they are not against the EU or Eurozone and that Ireland can continue its membership without ratifying the treaty. They are also framing a "no" vote as part of a larger resistance movement to "big bullies," which includes opposition to fracking for natural gas in Ireland, ire over new household taxes and controversy over bans on cutting turf in bogs for environmental reasons (many small farmers cut their own peat to burn for heating and cooking).  <PARAGRAPH>  Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny was among the 25 European leaders who signed the treaty earlier this year, but each country still needs to ratify it through their own legislative procedures, with 12 ratifications out of 17 Eurozone countries needed for it to take effect in January 2013. The treaty limits the size of the deficit and debt a country is allowed to accrue, which opponents say will gut their potential for important government spending and hence economic growth in these tough times. So far, only Portugal, Slovenia and Greece -- under the former government -- have ratified the treaty.  <PARAGRAPH>  Newly elected French leader Francois Hollande said the country would not ratify, and the political turmoil in Greece means its ratification there is also highly in doubt. Now there is much talk of a "Grexit" – Greece's leaving the EU and the Eurozone altogether -- and Germany has canceled its own scheduled May treaty ratification vote, given the developments.  <PARAGRAPH>  At a press conference on May 15, Sinn Fein jobs spokesperson Peadar Toibin said:  <PARAGRAPH>  Only Government led investment in job creation will tackle the unemployment crisis and lead to growth and recovery….The fact is the government can’t have it both ways. You cannot have a twin track approach. The choice is austerity or investment in jobs. This Treaty would prevent the type of government led investment which is needed for economic recovery in this State.  <PARAGRAPH>  In March, Ireland's unemployment rate was at 10 percent, with its youth unemployment rate among the highest in Europe and many young people planning to emigrate. (Its unemployment rate is still notably lower than Spain and Greece, which were at 24 and 21 percent, respectively.) A recent report by the group Social Justice Ireland found that more than 700,000 citizens are living in poverty, a 13 percent increase from two years ago.  <PARAGRAPH>  The Irish parties pushing the treaty say it will mean less austerity in the long run because it will give private investors and lenders confidence in Ireland. Joining the treaty is essential to securing loans or other financing through the intergovernmental European Stability Mechanism (ESM), an in-the-works and trouble-plagued successor to similar international lending bodies.  <PARAGRAPH>  In an address Fianna Fail TD Michael Martin said:  <PARAGRAPH>  Voting Yes will ensure that Ireland has access to the cheapest and most secure funding for our public services - and it is an essential part of the agenda to restore growth and job creation to Ireland and Europe. In two years’ time Ireland will need to raise at least €18bn from somewhere. We want Ireland to be able to borrow that money at affordable rates on the open market.  <PARAGRAPH>  Ireland is the only country putting the treaty to a popular referendum, with the results playing a significant symbolic and pragmatic role in the overall outcome of the treaty. Other countries’ parliaments need a simple or super majority to ratify.  <PARAGRAPH>  A website about the treaty published by the Institute for International and European Affairs says that Ireland will not be forced to leave the Eurozone or EU if it votes "no" on the referendum, but that "a 'no' vote risks diminished influence for Ireland and potentially a second tier status for Ireland within the Eurozone."  <PARAGRAPH>  There were calls for the EU to relieve some of Ireland’s bank debt to help build support for the austerity treaty in the referendum, and a group of Irish TDs (members of Ireland’s lower house of parliament) called for the vote to be delayed until fall to see how events on the world stage shake out and to see if economic growth measures could be added to the treaty. Meanwhile, treaty proponents are calling for a second vote if the treaty is voted down on May 31.  <PARAGRAPH>  Some have argued that Ireland can survive on its own without bailouts, in part because of its attractiveness to U.S. and other high-tech companies. This is how Fintan O’Toole described the debate over the austerity treaty in an editorial in the Irish Times:  <PARAGRAPH>  One way of putting the referendum that I like is that Brussels and Germany are the mother and father of the EU and the rest of the countries are kids. And some kids spend the money wisely but some, like Ireland, spend it on crazy things. "So the mum and dad keep giving the kids more and more money. But eventually they put their foot down and say, ‘Right, you can keep borrowing our money – if you sign this form to let us know what you’ll use it for.’" This, apparently, is what we’re teaching our kids now – that we are all children, subject to our strict but benign parents in Brussels and Berlin.  <PARAGRAPH>  Like Sinn Fein, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has called for a massive government investment in creating jobs. This month, Congress general secretary David Begg called for a "New Deal" instead of the European austerity treaty. He also pushed for the delay of the ratification vote, given developments in France and Greece. A press release from the Congress quoted Begg saying:  <PARAGRAPH>  Ireland has been a poster child of globalisation and, more recently, a poster child for austerity. Let us seize the opportunity to be a beacon of something good for a change.  <PARAGRAPH>  It is of course widely believed that the best hope for "change" lie in a country’s youth, but since the economy crashed Ireland’s youth have been leaving the country in droves, with the number of young emigrants increasing three-fold since 2008, according to the April report by Social Justice Ireland. (That report also chronicled the country’s income inequality, noting that "the poorest 10 per cent of households have an average disposable income of €210 a week, compared to an average of €2,276 a week for the richest 10 per cent.")  <PARAGRAPH>  The Irish Times quoted Social Justice Ireland director Father Sean Healy on the likely impact of increased austerity measures on Ireland’s youth:  <PARAGRAPH>  The austerity programme is contributing to Ireland’s loss of young people, the implications of which are stark as this loss will pose significant problems for economic recovery…The emigration ‘brain drain’ which in some quarters is being heralded perversely as a ‘safety valve’ is in fact a serious problem for Ireland and may well lead to a skills deficit in the long-term.
Chicago Lunch Ladies Push for Fresh Food for Students…and Job Security |  <PARAGRAPH> School cafeteria food is the butt of many jokes. Despite national attention and student activism aimed at making school lunches tastier and healthier, and federal regulations mandating more fruits and veggies that take effect July 1, word on the ground is that it still leaves much to be desired, to say the least. Prepackaged highly processed salty and sugary foods still make up a disproportionate part of the menu. And ironically, students, teachers and “lunch ladies” around the country have reported, many of the healthier new additions to cafeteria menus are going uneaten. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The union UNITE HERE Local 1, which represents 3,200 cafeteria workers in Chicago public schools, says this is the case in the more than 600 schools where they work. And they say school officials could have much more success with adding healthier options to the menu that students will actually eat if they consider more input from the cafeteria workers who talk with and observe the kids on a daily basis. <PARAGRAPH> Such worker input is now enshrined in a contract agreement signed between the union and the Chicago Board of Education this week, a measure the union is calling “landmark.” It also addresses the school district’s plans to increasingly replace actual cooking in many schools with “warming kitchens” where pre-made food would be warmed up. <PARAGRAPH> The union says that according to the school district’s 2008 bid solicitation for pre-made food, 178 elementary schools currently have only warming kitchens and – as of that time – that was the plan for all new elementary schools. UNITE HERE says pre-made food is bad for kids and also for cafeteria workers' job security. UNITE HERE senior research analyst Kyle Schafer said that hundreds of jobs could have been at risk if the school system went through with its previous plans for more warming kitchens. <PARAGRAPH> Schafer told me: <PARAGRAPH> We’ve lost a number of jobs in recent years – obviously it takes less folks to heat a meal than to make a meal from scratch. That’s how the history of institutional food service in schools has been going -- the move to more and more processed foods has largely been one to cut labor costs, not because anyone thought the food was better for the kids. This is both a more traditional labor issue and also a food issue in terms of how it affects the kids. <PARAGRAPH> The new five-year contract agreement stipulates that no full kitchens will be replaced by warming kitchens in existing schools, and the school board must consult with the union—giving them a chance to organize an opposition campaign—if they plan to build a new school with only a warming kitchen. <PARAGRAPH> Barbara Collins, a union member with more than 20 years working in school cafeterias, told me the provisions for worker input in the new contract are crucial to letting workers give kids food that is both healthy and that they will actually eat. She noted that recent switches for health reasons – like a shift from fried to baked potatoes – have been  nearly pointless since many kids won’t eat baked potatoes. Baked chicken has fared better among students, she noted. Such input from the workers who cook 77,000 breakfasts and 280,000 lunches for Chicago students each day will now be considered in developing new menus. <PARAGRAPH> “It’s kind of hard to feed children nowadays—it’s hard to please them,” Collins told me. “Our committee is going to come together and see if we can come up with some good ideas for the children.” <PARAGRAPH> The contract agreement capped a months-long campaign including rallies in January and April and two reports: "Feeding Chicago's Kids the Food they Deserve" in January – based on a survey of 436 school kitchen workers, and “Kitchens Without Cooks." As Collins indicated, the “Feeding” report found that 42 percent of workers thought students were not eating the new healthier menu items. <PARAGRAPH> Half of the respondents also said principals never eat cafeteria food – a finding that is not surprising but nonetheless is a bad sign. Perhaps most disturbingly, that study found that only 39 percent of cafeteria workers felt they could report concerns about food quality or safety to parents or others without fear of discipline, meaning almost two-thirds would likely stay silent even when they observed potential problems. <PARAGRAPH> A Chicago public schools teacher and parent, Sarah Wu, blogged anonymously -- fearing for her job -- for a year about horrendous cafeteria food. The Chicago Tribune described the offerings she consumed, often feeling sick as a result: <PARAGRAPH> …the surprising parade of plastic-wrapped, processed foods that appeared on her tray each day — from bagel dogs, popcorn chicken and Salisbury steak to green gelatin, peanut butter and jelly bars, and blue raspberry ice pops… <PARAGRAPH> Kitchens Without Cooks noted that nine out of 11 new elementary schools built since 2006 under a $1 billion program for modern schools include only warming kitchens. That means, the report says, that 81 percent of new elementary schools compared to 36 percent of older elementary schools serve frozen re-heated food. <PARAGRAPH> The report also quotes workers in various schools that have switched from cooking to “warming,” saying that students used to eat the food more when it was freshly-cooked. They say kids are more likely to throw away the food that resembles “TV dinners” – even if these meals are theoretically healthier “improvements” on the old fare. <PARAGRAPH> The Kitchens Without Cooks report quotes Tiffany Guynes, who is a kitchen worker at and also has a son attending the new Langston Hughes elementary school on the city’s south side. The study  says Guynes often packs a lunch for her son instead of letting him eat the food she serves the other students. <PARAGRAPH> The first day I walked into the cafeteria two questions came to my mind. Where is the stove? And where are the cooks? We don’t have either at Langston Hughes…I wouldn’t eat a lot of this food. If it’s not good enough for me, it’s not good enough for my son. <PARAGRAPH> The reports jibed with other media reports, including a November 2011 report by The Chicago Tribune that participation in school meal programs had dropped to 70 percent since healthier options were added, even though 82 percent of students were eligible for subsidized meals. <PARAGRAPH> Collins—whose four kids and 20-plus grandkids went to or are going to Chicago Public Schools —thinks the new contract is a start in helping both cafeteria workers and kids. She said: <PARAGRAPH> My crew, we take good care of the children. If a child is hungry they really can’t learn. If we feed them properly breakfast and lunch, they’ll do better. I want to see a smile on their face.
