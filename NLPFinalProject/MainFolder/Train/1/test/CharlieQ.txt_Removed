Georgia GOPers fall short |  <paragraph>  The Georgia Tipsheet blog   <hyperlink>  notes that the House GOP leadership elections were a flop for Georgia, which saw two members of its delegation fall short. <paragraph>  Rep. Tom Price lost to Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Wednesday in his bid to become conference chairman while Rep. Tom Graves lost Thursday in his attempt to head the Republican Study Committee.  <paragraph>  While it’s a blow to Georgia interests, the outcomes are probably a net plus for the House GOP in the wake of an election that underscored the party’s weakness in competing with women and in regions outside the South.  <paragraph>  Had Price and Graves won the posts they vied for, top House leadership would have consisted of 5 white males, three of them from the South. The new team will now have one woman at the table, and will have more regional balance – two from the West (McMorris Rodgers and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California), a Midwesterner in Speaker John Boehner and two Southerners, Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and Republican Study Committee Chair Steve Scalise of Louisiana.  <paragraph>  Still, the GOP's congressional wing has a ways to go in presenting a different face to voters. As POLITICO's Manu Raju and Jake Sherman   <hyperlink>  report, the House and Senate GOP chose four women lawmakers out of 14 spots for senior leadership positions.
Rasmussen explains |   <paragraph>  Rasmussen Reports, the prolific automated pollster whose projections fell far from the mark Tuesday,  <hyperlink>  explains what went wrong: “ Our final daily presidential tracking poll showed Romney at 49% and Obama at 48%. Instead, the president got 50% of the vote and Romney 48%. We were disappointed that our final results were not as close to the final result as they had been in preceding elections. There was a similar pattern in the state polls. For example, in Ohio we projected a tie at 49% but the president reached 50% of the vote and the challenger got just 48%. Although every individual result in the battleground states was within the margin of error, the numbers we projected were consistently a bit more favorable for Romney than the actual results. A preliminary review indicates that one reason for this is that we underestimated the minority share of the electorate. In 2008, 26% of voters were non-white. We expected that to remain relatively constant. However, in 2012, 28% of voters were non-white. That was exactly the share projected by the Obama campaign. It is not clear at the moment whether minority turnout increased nationally, white turnout decreased, or if it was a combination of both. The increase in minority turnout has a significant impact on the final projections since Romney won nearly 60% of white votes while Obama won an even larger share of the minority vote. Another factor may be related to the generation gap. It is interesting to note that the share of seniors who showed up to vote was down slightly from 2008 while the number of young voters was up slightly. Pre-election data suggested that voters older than 65 were more enthusiastic about voting than they had been four years earlier so the decline bears further examination. ”  <paragraph>  As mea culpas go, this one is a little thin. While Rasmussen wasn’t alone in misreading the composition of the 2012 electorate, and it’s true that all the firm’s battleground state polls were within the 4-point margin of error, there are a few clunkers in there. In Wisconsin, for example, Rasmussen was the only public pollster reporting a 49-49 tie — in the final two weeks, the five other pollsters in the field there pegged Obama’s lead at 3 and 9 percentage points. The actual result was a 53-46 Obama win.  <paragraph>  Colorado was similarly errant. In the final round of polls, Rasmussen was the one reporting the biggest Romney lead — 50-47 — but the outcome was 51-46 Obama.  <paragraph>  Rasmussen got a few states right — placing Obama in the lead in Nevada and New Hampshire and Romney ahead in North Carolina — but simply getting the winner correct in 3 of 9 battleground states isn’t going to win over the many detractors who regularly dismiss the firm’s polls for their often overly rosy GOP predictions.
GOP fortunes: From bad to worse in Calif. |   <paragraph>  After a rough election night for Republicans in the nation’s most populous state,  <hyperlink>   the Los Angeles Times sets the scene in California for the next two years:  “ Gov. Jerry Brown and his fellow Democrats are on the cusp of a coveted supermajority in both the Assembly and Senate, giving them the rare power to raise taxes without any Republican support. No single party has held such a supermajority in Sacramento since 1933. To cement the dual two-thirds majorities when the Legislature gets down to business next year, Democrats must hold onto one of two Senate seats to be vacated and a few Assembly seats won in tight races. The Senate seats will be filled in special elections expected in March. The supermajorities would mark a dramatic shift in Sacramento's balance of power, where GOP legislators have aggressively used their ability to block state budget plans and prevent revenue increases to scale back the scope of state government. Coupled with the approval of Brown's tax plan, Proposition 30, the Democrats now have not only the power but also the money to break free of the deficit that has paralyzed state government for years. ”   <paragraph>  Just when it looked like things couldn’t get any worse for Republicans in California, it appears they did. And at the congressional level, there are still three uncalled House races where GOP incumbents are trailing their Democratic challengers with 100 percent of the votes in.  <paragraph>  California Republican Party Chairman Tom Del Beccaro issued this statement Wednesday in response to the election results, which included a big win for labor on a payroll deduction ballot measure.  <paragraph>  “ Yesterday, California moved farther to the Left with a big push from public employee unions. There can be little doubt now that California public employee unions are, by far, the most powerful political force in this state. However, that comes at a heavy price for struggling Californians...  <paragraph>  In a nutshell, "the state is run for the very rich, the very poor and the public employees.' "In my view, Californians will now get to see the plain results of the Democrat-controlled policies both nationally and here at home as the California economy undoubtedly continues to struggle if not get worse under those policies.  <paragraph>  In the meantime, it will be up to Republicans to continue to reach out to more voters and make the case that we need to bring balance to our policies in California. This task has been made more daunting but ever more necessary. ”  <paragraph>  The presidential exit polls paint an especially grim picture that suggests the state won't be competitive in any way for a long time. Obama won every income group, every education group, big and small cities, suburbs and independents.  <paragraph>  While Mitt Romney carried the white vote with 53 percent, Obama won other race and ethnicity groups by an even wider margin than nationally: 96 percent among black voters, 72 percent among Hispanics, 79 percent among Asians.
Obama leads among Asian Americans |  <paragraph>   A new California poll shows why President Barack Obama is again expected to capture the Asian American vote.  <paragraph>   In the state with by far the largest Asian population in the nation, the Field Poll reports Obama holds a 58 percent to 25 percent lead over Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>   In 2008, national exit polls gave Obama a 62 percent to 35 percent advantage over John McCain among Asians, who made up two percent of the electorate.  <paragraph>   According to a  <hyperlink>  Field Poll released Saturday, Obama runs best among California’s Chinese Americans, a group he wins by 63-21. The margin with Vietnamese Americans – a demographic that tends to be more Republican-friendly – is 47-27. Among Korean Americans, Obama leads 41-20 with 39 percent undecided -- the reported percentage of undecided voters among all Asian subgroups is unusually high for this late point in the campaign.  <paragraph>   Among other Asian groups, Obama leads 62-28.  <paragraph>   There’s no data for the Filipino American vote, a constituency where Republicans have had a toehold in the past.  <paragraph>   While the poll notes that the Asian subgroup samples are small, the numbers don’t seem dramatically at odds with a national poll conducted in April by the Democratic firm Lake Research Partners. Back then, nearly six in 10 Asian voters also favored Obama.
Barone: Romney wins, handily |   <paragraph>   Michael Barone, a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner and co-author of the Almanac of American Politics,  <hyperlink> goes out on a limb and predicts victory for Mitt Romney – by a margin of nearly 100 electoral votes.  <paragraph>  “  Fundamentals usually prevail in American elections. That's bad news for Barack Obama. True, Americans want to think well of their presidents and many think it would be bad if Americans were perceived as rejecting the first black president. But it's also true that most voters oppose Obama's major policies and consider unsatisfactory the very sluggish economic recovery -- Friday's jobs report showed an unemployment uptick. Also, both national and target state polls show that independents, voters who don't identify themselves as Democrats or Republicans, break for Romney. That might not matter if Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 39 to 32 percent, as they did in the 2008 exit poll. But just about every indicator suggests that Republicans are more enthusiastic about voting -- and about their candidate -- than they were in 2008, and Democrats are less so… Bottom line: Romney 315, Obama 223. That sounds high for Romney. But he could drop Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and still win the election. Fundamentals. ”  <paragraph>   In Barone’s estimation, Romney essentially sweeps the swing states, with the exception of Nevada, and even picks up Pennsylvania.  <paragraph>   Michael’s views have drifted rightward over the years and he's become a prominent conservative voice, so there will be a tendency among Democrats to dismiss his prediction. But having worked closely with him in the past — we worked together to produce three Almanacs – I'd argue that no one in the business has a greater command of the American political landscape than Barone.  <paragraph>   Even so, I don’t see his sweep scenario playing out.  <paragraph>   It’s not as implausible as it seems given the tightness of the battleground state map, but it’s contingent on the notion that most pollsters are fundamentally misreading the composition of the electorate -- I'm not there yet. His Ohio and New Hampshire arguments also feel a little unconvincing to me. And my sense is that Pennsylvania and Michigan will move in tandem – probably for Obama, but together in any case.
Richard Mourdock, party buzzkill |         <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   In what’s shaping up to a good Republican year in Indiana — Mitt Romney is likely to carry the state, Mike Pence is likely to win the governorship and both legislative chambers figure to remain in GOP control — GOP Senate nominee Richard Mourdock’s candidacy has turned out to be a discordant note.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    The Evansville Courier & Press reports on a marked difference in the reactions to the top of the ticket nominees at the Indiana GOP fall dinner Monday.  <paragraph>   “ However, at the Indiana Republican Party's fall dinner at the Ritz Charles in Carmel on Monday night, enthusiasm for Mourdock's candidacy was measured compared to the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Mike Pence. Some of the hundreds in attendance — mostly women — remained sitting during an ovation for Mourdock and then stood eagerly for Pence. Several Republicans who attended said the reaction was the same at a reception before the dinner.    <paragraph>   Mike McDaniel, the former Indiana Republican Party chairman, said he believes the candidacies of Pence and Mitt Romney will buoy Mourdock — but that the comments on rape and abortion did some damage.    <paragraph>   "Those are comments that he knows he wishes he had back, and yeah, they made it closer," McDaniel said. "I think all the momentum was going in his direction, and that put a screech on that." ”    <paragraph>   Fortunately for Mourdock, top Indiana Republicans haven’t abandoned his candidacy — in part because of what they see as the over-the-top ferocity of the ensuing Democratic attacks against him.    <paragraph>   If he manages to pull out a victory, he’ll still have some serious fence-mending to do if he hopes to be effective in the Senate. Even if Mourdock had never made his comments about pregnancies caused by rape, it would have taken some time for him to win over Republicans who still nurse grievances left from his primary victory over veteran Sen. Dick Lugar. On top of that, he would arrive in Washington far more politically radioactive than the typical freshman senator.
NRCC still spending in Rhode Island. Really. |     <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Here’s a headline you don’t expect to see in heavily Democratic Rhode Island, 11 days out from Election Day: “National GOP to spend $280K on final TV push to oust Cicilline.”   <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    Ted Nesi’s report for WPRI: “Republicans have said for weeks they don’t believe the hype that Democratic Congressman David Cicilline is pulling away from GOP challenger Brendan Doherty. Now they’re putting their money where their mouths are. <paragraph>   The National Republican Congressional Committee confirmed Friday it will spend $280,000 on a final round of television commercials to air during the closing week of Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District race, enough to buy 1,000 gross rating points. The ads will air Oct. 30 to Nov. 6.”    <paragraph>   Given the state and the district’s Democratic orientation, the national GOP has typically checked out of Little Rhody by this time of year — if they paid attention at all. But the NRCC’s financial commitment at this late stage is a sign that Cicilline is an incumbent who remains in the danger zone.    <paragraph>   Cicilline, a freshman whose first term has been dogged by controversy surrounding statements he made about the fiscal health of Providence before he left the mayor’s office for Washington, is one of two New England Democrats facing uphill reelection challenges this year — the other is Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney.    <paragraph>   Suffice it to say, if Democrats aren’t able to hold House seats in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in a presidential election year, then there isn’t much hope of capturing a majority.    <paragraph>   UPDATE: Not to be outdone, the DCCC is     <hyperlink>    countering with a $315,000 ad buy for Cicilline, "placed just hours after the National Republican Congressional Committee revealed it will spend $280,000 on a final round of commercials to help Doherty."
The final days of Laura Richardson |     <paragraph>       <picture>  <paragraph>   The House election homestretch always seems to feature one member of Congress who essentially gives up before Election Day, and this cycle that member appears to be California Democratic Rep. Laura Richardson.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    POLITICO’s Jessica Meyers: “ Richardson raised $7,000 from July through September — a figure smaller than the $9,000 she loaned her own campaign and the roughly $8,000 she was credited for in refunds and canceled checks to her lawyers.    <paragraph>   If the Democratic Transportation and Infrastructure Committee member beats fellow Democratic incumbent Janice Hahn in November, Richardson will have lifted more political baggage across the finish line than any other candidate this election cycle.   <paragraph>   Her campaign did not respond to requests for comment.”    <paragraph>   By raising just $7,000 in the latest quarter — a paltry sum for a member of Congress, let alone one who is engaged in a tough  incumbent vs. incumbent matchup — Richardson appears to have concluded some time ago that there’s no viable path to reelection.    <paragraph>   The congresswoman finished 20 percentage points behind Hahn in California's June "top-two" primary, a disheartening sign since they were the only two candidates running. The result offered little hope that Richardson could close the gap by November.    <paragraph>   Redistricting-related changes to her seat and the congresswoman’s ethics issues were hard enough to overcome, but without any cash — Richardson had just $68,000 cash on hand at the end of September — it’s nearly impossible.
