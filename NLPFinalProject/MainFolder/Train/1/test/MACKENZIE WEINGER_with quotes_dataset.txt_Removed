Post ombudsman on Brauchli and Baron | Washington Post ombudsman Patrick Pexton on Friday reflected on the end of Marcus Brauchli's reign as executive editor and the future of the paper under Martin Baron. <paragraph> Pexton wrote in his column, "A new era — and editor — for The Post  <hyperlink> ," that Brauchli had the "misfortune" of leading the Post during the last four years when "there has been no harder time to lead a major national or metropolitan newspaper." <paragraph> "What did Brauchli accomplish, and where does his departure leave the newsroom, which will now go through more turmoil and perhaps more cuts?" Pexton asked. "And what will the change mean for readers and for The Post, a publication important to the functioning of American democracy?" <paragraph> Brauchli's "most important legacy," Pexton wrote, is that he "he and his team brought The Post fully into the digital era." <paragraph> He has an "understated style of leadership that many liked," but Pexton said reporters and editors told him they wanted "more engagement" and a newsroom leader who could "drive the newsroom, pushing the staff to perform on big news stories, a harder-hitting journalist — not in an overbearing sense but in a determined, fire-in-the-belly, newshound kind of way." <paragraph> That wasn't the only newsroom complaint Pexton heard. The Post's Local staff "felt neglected until around the last year of Brauchli's tenure," many in the newsroom thought the Style section "was allowed to lose its focus and distinctive voice" and some Post veterans said Brauchli "never really connected or reached out to them, nor tapped their institutional knowledge." <paragraph>  "Now the newsroom is worried about more upheaval, just when many reporters and editors felt things were settling down. They worry about their jobs and whether Baron, who downsized the Globe’s newsroom, is being brought in to do more of the same," he wrote. <paragraph>  Post publisher Katharine Weymouth told Pexton she does not intend for any “change in mission and no draconian cuts.” <paragraph> "The key point for The Post, for newcomer Baron and for the newsroom to remember at this difficult time is that the mission of this paper, even amid all the technological and financial challenges, is larger than any individual. That mission must be preserved," Pexton wrote. "The Post’s brand, identity and purpose is to keep governments — national and local — honest and to point out when they’re not, to chronicle our age and the people in the capital region who define it, to tell a good sports story and to have some fun doing all of the above." 
Foreign media eyes U.S. results | President Barack Obama’s victory over Mitt Romney took center stage at media organizations around the world on Wednesday as they assessed what Obama’s reelection spells for their own countries over the next four years.  <paragraph> In Israel, the left-leaning paper Haaretz wrote about Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s “election-night double whammy.” <paragraph> “He suffered a caustic and humiliating political double loss,” Haaretz’s Yossi Verter wrote. “It began with Naftali Bennett’s election as the new chairman of the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party and ended with President Barack Obama’s reelection and the defeat of Netanyahu’s old friend Mitt Romney in the race for the White House.” <paragraph> And that means that Netanyahu “will pay the price” with his relationship with Obama. <paragraph> “The chilly and murky relationship between the current and next president and the current prime minister – who is also very likely to be the next prime minister – is well-known,” Verter wrote. “Netanyahu gambled on Romney. Netanyahu’s bet did not come in. Netanyahu will pay the price. How high will the cost be? How painful will it be? Obama will decide, at the time and place of his choosing. If he decides to meddle in our election campaign in some fashion, no one could blame him. Bibi started it.” <paragraph> And The Jerusalem Post put together a round-up of Israeli politicians’ responses to Obama’s victory, noting that Netanyahu “hosted US Ambassador Dan Shapiro at his Jerusalem office Wednesday to personally assure him that he wanted to work closely with US President Barack Obama.” Meanwhile, the Post wrote, “defense minister Ehud Barak issued his congratulatory statement even before Obama’s acceptance speech. According to Channel 2 reporter Udi Segal, he was the first to do so.” And President Shimon Peres wrote Obama a letter saying, “your success will be the success of us all.” <paragraph>  Kenya’s state-run media organization — Kenya Broadcasting Corporation — reported on the celebration in Kogelo, the hometown of Obama’s father. Family spokesperson Malick Abongo told journalists that “we did not want to celebrate or have any prior arrangement for that because the race was too tight, but now we can throw a party.” The village is planning to throw a feast to celebrate, KBC added. <paragraph> Reuters interviewed Romney’s Mormon relatives in Mexico, who the wire service wrote “mourned his presidential election defeat.” <paragraph> Just to let him slip away from being president of the United States is a real tragedy for the U.S. because he could have given the country so much,” Virginia Romney told Reuters. “He has been such a success in everything he has done.” <paragraph> China’s state news agency Xinhua reflected on the future of U.S.-Chinese relations in a commentary piece that never mentioned Obama. <paragraph> “China seeks to develop and engage with the international community in a peaceful way. It wants to build a new type of relationship — one defined by mutual benefit and cooperation — with major countries,” Xinhua wrote. “Whereas, there remains the antiquated attitude in which an emerging player is considered as a threat to established ones and should be suppressed. This mindset has led to much unrest and even world wars in the past, but has yet to be abandoned.”
Finding fault, world media watches | From Asia to the Middle East to Europe, media organizations worldwide are anxiously awaiting the results of the U.S. presidential election, parsing what either a second term for President Barack Obama or a win by Mitt Romney would mean for their own countries.  <paragraph> China’s state news agency Xinhua wrote in its column “China Voice” that the election means there will “hopefully” be a “pause in the China-bashing game.” During the campaign, “pointing fingers at China became an easy and convenient way for the two candidates to score political gains while avoiding taking responsibility for mishandling the domestic economy.” <paragraph> “If scapegoating and vilifying China are merely campaign tricks, with the heated campaign drawing to an end, it is time for whoever the president-in-waiting is to tone down his tough rhetoric and adopt a more rational stance,” the Nov. 6 column stated. “Despite arguments, there is common sense between the United States and China. As the world’s largest and second-largest economies, they can not afford to grapple with the backlash of any severe confrontations in any arena.” <paragraph> The column calls for the U.S. to find opportunities to partner with China and keep open a “constructive dialogue.” <paragraph> “It is better for the next U.S. president, [whoever] he may turn out to be, to seize the historic chance to extend the partnership,” the column stated. <paragraph> In Israel, left-leaning Haaretz newspaper’s senior correspondent Amir Oren focused on the impact of a potential Obama win on upcoming Israeli elections. <paragraph> “This is Obama’s second chance, after four years of missed opportunities, to clarify which direction he wants to go on the Middle East, so that Israeli voters will know if they are voting for a prime minister who will be on track to clash with Obama from the get-go,” Oren wrote. <paragraph> “In addition to making intensive efforts to reach an Israeli-Palestinian accord, Obama can be expected to give Iran a clear choice: talks or combat aircraft. He won’t waste his second chance,” Oren added. 
Brian Williams knocks Rush Limbaugh | NBC’s Brian Williams on Thursday knocked Rush Limbaugh for his comments about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, telling “Rock Center” viewers that the radio show host’s statements are proof “politics survived” the storm. <paragraph> After praising Christie for his “tactile and indefatigable” response, Williams laid into the radio host for his comments about the governor. Among other things, Limbaugh this week has called Christie a “Greek column” for President Barack Obama who has been showing "man love" for the president and has gone "overboard in praising a failed president" for political purposes. <paragraph> "So after all this loss you might be curious as to why Rush Limbaugh went after Gov. Christie today," Williams said. "It was because he’s getting along so well with the president, working together, saying nice things about Barack Obama. Just when we feared the storm wiped away everything, we learned politics survived.” <paragraph> “Proof that life goes on,” he added after the segment wrapped. <paragraph> During his monologue, Williams also blasted former FEMA director Michael Brown for saying the lesson of Hurricane Sandy is that people need to “chill out.” <paragraph>  "Something we intend to pass along to these homeowners in Mantaloking, New Jersey, as soon as the embers from their homes have thoroughly cooled," Williams said, adding that Brown was responsible for the “largest domestic human rights outrage of the modern era, the Katrina response.” 
Nocera questions Mark Thompson hire | The New York Times’s Joe Nocera pointedly asks in his Tuesday column if incoming New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson, who is facing questions over the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, is right for the job. <paragraph>  In his column <hyperlink> , Nocera lays out the timeline of Thompson’s public statements on what he knew and when about the spiked Savile investigation and asks whether The New York Times Co. made the right call with this hire. Thompson is set to start his new gig as the president and CEO of The New York Times Co. on Nov. 12. <paragraph>  (Also on POLITICO: N.Y. Times covers CEO's role in BBC sex abuse scandal <hyperlink> ) “His nameplate is already on his office door. He is getting to know Times employees. Yet, since early October, all anybody has asked about Thompson are those two most damning of questions: What did he know, and when did he know it?” Nocera wrote. <paragraph>  The various statements Thompson has made <hyperlink>— that he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being killed, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011 — are worrisome, Nocera wrote. <paragraph> “Thompson winds up appearing willfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organization the BBC was when Thompson was running it — and what kind of leader he was. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he’d be at The Times,” he wrote. <paragraph> (Also on POLITICO: NYT CEO addresses BBC sex abuse scandal  <hyperlink>) New York Times Co. Chairman “Arthur Sulzberger is in a difficult spot,” he noted. Sulzberger, who declined Nocera’s interview request, “appears to have accepted Thompson’s insistence that he knew nothing about the explosive allegations that became public literally 50 days after he accepted the Times job. Sulzberger is backing his man unreservedly.” <paragraph> “For the sake of Times employees — not to mention the readers who want to see a vibrant New York Times Company — let’s hope his faith in Thompson is warranted. Otherwise, the BBC won’t be the only organization being asked tough questions about its judgment,” Nocera wrote. <paragraph>  
Nate Silver on 'Morning Joe': Why pollsters got it wrong | <video> <paragraph> New York Times statistician Nate Silver stopped by MSNBC's “Morning Joe" on Tuesday to discuss how he got it right this election when so many others didn’t. <paragraph>  Host Joe Scarborough — who during the campaign questioned Silver for calling the race decisively <hyperlink>  for President Barack Obama — kicked off the sit-down by addressing their infamous bet. <hyperlink> “We didn't bet because we love humanity too much to bet, but I think we gave money and we made a contribution, in Nate’s name, to AmeriCares,” Scarborough said. <paragraph>  After Scarborough joked that “the first thing I want to do — before your apology to me — is let’s sell books,” Silver discussed why so many polls were wrong this year and incorrectly called it as a much closer race for Mitt Romney. Silver said most of the major network polls — NBC/Wall Street Journal, ABC/Washington Post, CBS/New York Times — are “pretty good," while the polls that faltered made too many assumptions about the population. <paragraph> “I think that high-quality polling really differentiates itself now because if you take an automated poll, you miss people who have cellphones, which is about a third of the population now,” Silver said. “And they're mostly younger urban demographic, mostly Democrats, so you will undersample Democrats, to use that buzzword, if you don't call people who have cellphones. And lo and behold, those polls had a Republican bias this year. Not because the pollsters are evil partisan, but because, hey, if you miss a big chunk of the population that's Democratic-leaning, you're going to have problems.” <paragraph>  The best pollsters, Silver said, “let the sample tell you what it is by themselves.” The ones who didn’t “put their finger on the scale” and didn’t make assumptions about the voting public were most successful. <paragraph> “Just going with what the data said instead of making assumptions is usually the best practice whenever you're doing any kind of scientific survey and that worked again this year,” Silver said. <paragraph>  As for Romney, Silver called the Republican a "B-, C+ candidate" with an “adequate" campaign that just couldn’t cut it against the powerful advantage held by an incumbent president. <paragraph> “I think Neil Newhouse, the pollster there, I think those guys are pretty smart guys with a frankly, B-, C+ candidate, ran a pretty close campaign,” Silver said. <paragraph>   But it’s already time to look past this cycle, Silver said. <paragraph> “I’m a pro-horserace guy. I’m more interested in diagnosing 2016 now than Benghazi, for example, because that’s where my bread is buttered,” Silver said. “But if you’re going to do horserace, then do it the right way because it can be more data driven.” <paragraph> ack in late October, Scarborough had blasted Silver’s statistical process. <paragraph>  And anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a tossup right now is such an ideologue, they should be kept away from typewriters, computers, laptops and microphones for the next 10 days, because they're jokes,” Scarborough said on “Morning Joe.” <paragraph>   As the interview wrapped on Tuesday, Scarborough, who noted earlier in the show he had predicted an Obama win, invited Silver to come back after the pair joked about sports.   
Frontiers of campaign advertising | A new campaign ad making the rounds in a New York congressional race forces Internet users to type a candidate specific phrase — “right to choose” — if they want to change their password. <paragraph> The ad from Democrat Julian Schreibman’s media consultant J.J. Balaban for the NY-19 race against Republican Rep. Chris Gibson, functions like a CAPTCHA test to ensure that it’s a real person making the request rather than a computer program or spammer. In this case, before certain New York users can move to the reset password page, they’ll see the Schreibman ad and will have to enter the phrase connected with it. <paragraph>  The ad states “Chris Gibson opposes a woman’s ‘right to choose’” and asks the user to enter the quoted text — “right to choose.” The user cannot move on to change their password until they correctly enter the phrase, Balaban said. <paragraph>  “We have never heard of anyone doing this kind of advertising before, but it seemed like an innovative way to bolster what we are doing on TV that is uniquely targeted,” Balaban told POLITICO in an email. “We all learned in school that the best way to remember something is to write it down ... again and again. “<paragraph> The Web ad is running in “ZIP codes with high persuadable voters” on sites that include aol.com, NASDAQ.com, BHG.com and AmericanGreetings.com, he said. The campaign is centered around a TV spot  <hyperlink>  about women and health care that features several women speaking about Gibson’s policies. One woman states, “Gibson opposes a woman’s right to choose" and another says, “That’s not moderate, Mr. Gibson. That’s just wrong.” <paragraph>  The Web ad is "a unique tool the requires voters to write the issue we want them to remember,” Balaban said. <paragraph>“We're always looking for new ways of trying to get our client's message across, particularly in a year like this year in which there will be a high voter turnout. Also, a majority of NY19 is in the priciest TV market in the nation — New York City — so this is a cost-efficient way to support what we are doing on other mediums," he added.  
CQ Roll Call names new editorial director |  CQ Roll Call announced Monday that Susan Benkelman has officially become the publication’s editorial director. <paragraph>  Benkelman was named interim editorial director after Mike Mills left the post earlier this year, and CQ Roll Call executive vice president and managing director Keith White told staffers in an email that Benkelman starts immediately. <paragraph>  “Her deep understanding of our unique brand of congressional news and information coupled with her proven track record in transforming products will position us well as we continue to push ahead as the leader in digital news and information on Congress and public policy,” White wrote in an email obtained by POLITICO. <paragraph>  Benkelman joined CQ Roll Call in 1997 as social policy editor and later became assistant managing editor before joining The Washington Post for a year. She returned to the publication in 2001 as editor of the magazine and then was appointed executive editor for news, White wrote. <paragraph>  “Most recently, working closely with Meg Hargreaves, she has overseen the merging of our print dailies and the restructuring of the CQ Roll Call newsroom,” he noted.
