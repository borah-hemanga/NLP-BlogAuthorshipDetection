The final days of Laura Richardson |     <paragraph>       <picture>  <paragraph>   The House election homestretch always seems to feature one member of Congress who essentially gives up before Election Day, and this cycle that member appears to be California Democratic Rep. Laura Richardson.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    POLITICO’s Jessica Meyers: “ Richardson raised $7,000 from July through September — a figure smaller than the $9,000 she loaned her own campaign and the roughly $8,000 she was credited for in refunds and canceled checks to her lawyers.    <paragraph>   If the Democratic Transportation and Infrastructure Committee member beats fellow Democratic incumbent Janice Hahn in November, Richardson will have lifted more political baggage across the finish line than any other candidate this election cycle.   <paragraph>   Her campaign did not respond to requests for comment.”    <paragraph>   By raising just $7,000 in the latest quarter — a paltry sum for a member of Congress, let alone one who is engaged in a tough  incumbent vs. incumbent matchup — Richardson appears to have concluded some time ago that there’s no viable path to reelection.    <paragraph>   The congresswoman finished 20 percentage points behind Hahn in California's June "top-two" primary, a disheartening sign since they were the only two candidates running. The result offered little hope that Richardson could close the gap by November.    <paragraph>   Redistricting-related changes to her seat and the congresswoman’s ethics issues were hard enough to overcome, but without any cash — Richardson had just $68,000 cash on hand at the end of September — it’s nearly impossible.
