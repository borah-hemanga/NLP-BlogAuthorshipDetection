39 percent? | <paragraph> It was a startling announcement that got too little attention: Earlier this month the Federal Reserve issued findings showing that the median U.S. household lost nearly 39 percent of its wealth from 2007 to 2010. <paragraph> If you're looking for a missing decimal point--surely it's 3.9 percent, you might think--you're looking in vain. <paragraph> Anyone who cares about America's place in the 21st Century economy should find this 39 percent figure depressing for all the obvious reasons.  But that shocking statistic also makes our task all the more clear: we must grow our way back into confidence and prosperity. And we get to decide whether Obama or Romney has the best chance of achieving that. <paragraph> That's a hell of a debate. But the Fed numbers show that the winner of that battle will have a historic task on his hands come next January.
Time again for Obama to lead from behind |   <paragraph>  Today, Sunday morning newspapers around the world screamed with headlines announcing yet another tragedy out of Syria. Journalists inside the war-torn country report that forces aligned with Bashar al-Assad massacred at least 90 Syrians with indiscriminate mortar attacks on civilian targets; more than 30 children were among the dead.  <paragraph>  The massacre in Houla is another example of how deadly Kofi Annan's Syrian cease-fire has been for civilians who still believe the international community will actually do something to prevent further slaughter. After yesterday's attacks, Syrians have reason to become increasingly bitter at the United States for sitting back over the past year and doing very little while Assad murdered 10,000 of his own citizens.    <paragraph>  Imagine how difficult it must be for the mother of a Syrian child killed by Assad's bloodied hands to grasp the geopolitical complexities that compelled the United States to launch air attacks against Muammar Gadhafi's Libya (in the name of protecting civilians) while the same superpower has sat idly by while its enemy indiscriminately kills his fellow countrymen. The reality is that the Administration's Libya and Syria policies cannot be squared in a way that makes sense to even the most gifted foreign-policy analyst.   <paragraph>  It would be depressing to believe that the greatest sin 10,000 dead Syrians had on their heads before being killed was to have the bad luck of not being born in an oil-rich country like Libya. And yet I am not cynical enough to believe that such crude calculations enter the minds of American presidents.   <paragraph>  But with every unanswered massacre that Assad launches, Americans and members of the international community can be forgiven for possessing a healthy dose of skepticism.  <paragraph>  That's why it is time once again for Barack Obama to lead from behind. His patience toward Libya last year angered neoconservative hawks who would've preferred the president launch attacks first and ask questions later. But he wisely chose instead to give the Arab League and our European allies enough time and space to take the lead against Gadhafi's ruthless regime. It was then left, of course, to American men and women in uniform to help drive the Libyan dictator from power. They did just that, and the president was rightly praised for his shrewd handling of the crisis.   <paragraph>  The growing crisis in Syria calls for a similar approach. Fortunately, the president has already declared that Mr. Assad must go. His administration has also wisely continued to ramp up pressure on Russia.   <paragraph>  But the president must do more, by focusing intense pressure on allies and unbearable pressure on enemies to drive Bashar al-Assad from power. That outcome is not only a moral imperative. It is also in the United States long-term strategic interest.  <paragraph>  That is why it is time for a repeat performance from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
The widening partisan divide |   <paragraph>  There they go again.  <paragraph>  The White House and Congress are starting to circle each other in another mindless default dawdle while Greece teeters, Italy shakes, Spain splinters and France frets. The Eurozone's southern states are staggering toward insolvency while millions of Europeans cope with Depression-style suffering.  <paragraph>  The Greek political system is suffering a nervous breakdown, with spoiled voters almost certainly assuring an economic meltdown and Greece's exit from the EU.  <paragraph>  Spain's economy is strapped with a 25 percent unemployment rate that tops out at 50 percent for that nation's young workers. The situation has gotten so bad that its prime minister is now fretting that his country may soon be shut out of world markets. Italy's debt now equals a staggering 120 percent of its nation's GDP while the country suffers through three straight quarters of economic decline.  <paragraph>  Now the rest of Europe waits nervously to see how the dominoes falling in Athens will affect Rome, Paris and Berlin.  <paragraph>  Meanwhile, U.S. politicians continue playing the same insipid Washington games that have led our country to a record $16 trillion debt. Over the past 24 hours, GOP House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid exchanged barbs about yet another default showdown, while President Obama called both sides into the White House so he could quickly leak details of his scolding lecture to lawmakers.  <paragraph>  That's sure to seal the deal, Mr. President.  <paragraph>  Taken together, the events of the past 24 hours prove that our national leaders remain locked in trench warfare where neither side dares to cross the ever widening partisan divide.  <paragraph>  Politically, some House members will probably benefit from such reckless, ideological behavior. But the president will not. It will be incumbent upon him to show independent voters just how aggressively he will fight over the next four years to bring deficit spending under control. Leave it to Bill Clinton to understand the moment at hand and figure out how to capitalize politically. Tuesday night, while mere politicians were lobbing spit balls at each other, the former president addressed the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and declared that facing down the budget crisis should be "front and center" in the 2012 campaign.  <paragraph>  Before left wing bloggers attack Mr. Clinton, they should remember that this is the same Democratic president who bloodied his Republican enemies by declaring that "the era of big government is over."  <paragraph>  Of course it wasn't by a long shot but then-President Clinton knew that the best way to win independent voters away from the GOP was by avoiding the label of "big government liberal." He signed a Republican welfare reform bill, promised to balance the budget and then got easily reelected in 1996.  <paragraph>  Barack Obama needs to perform a similar magic trick 16 years later.  <paragraph>  Despite the Republican Party's gallant efforts over the last six months to destroy their brand and help reelect their enemy, President Obama still trails a listless opponent in many polls. He is scoring poorly with voters on the economy. And too many independent voters dismiss him (for good reason) as a big spending liberal. To turn things around, the White House needs to follow Clinton's example and set up its GOP opponents.  <paragraph>  That will require a bold strategy and a new kind of thinking at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It will demand a big idea on long-term debt reduction and short term growth. And that bold strategy will include President Obama's strong endorsement of the Simpson-Bowles plan to save America from economic insolvency. Liberals will protest, Democratic candidates will squeal, but it is the White House's best chance to put Mitt Romney in a corner and win over independent voters.  <paragraph>  It really shouldn't be that hard considering that Mr. Obama would only be endorsing the conclusions of his own debt commission.
George W. Bush's friends on the left |   <paragraph>  For a president who left office loathed by progressives and most of polite society, <hyperlink> George W. Bush continues to gain admirers among those whom liberals admire most.  <paragraph>   <hyperlink>  U2 frontman and legendary do-gooder Bono shocked many when he told Jon Stewart that George W. Bush did an "amazing" job in his work involving AIDS in Africa.  <paragraph>  "I know that's hard for you to accept," Bono told the host, "but George kind of knocked it out of the park. I can tell you, and I'm actually here to tell you that America now has 5 million people being kept alive by these drugs. That's something that everyone should know."  <paragraph>  Another secular saint of the left, Sir Bob Geldof, has been even more direct in his praise of the conservative ex-president.  <paragraph>  Geldof told reporters that he was "pissed off" by the media's refusal to report the truth about Bush's good works, saying that when it came to saving Africa, George W. Bush "has done more than any other president so far."  <paragraph>  "This is the triumph of American policy really," he said. "It was probably unexpected of the man. It was expected of the nation, but not of the man, but both rose to the occasion."  <paragraph>  "What's in it for Mr. Bush? Absolutely nothing," Geldof told reporters.  <paragraph>  Then there is the interview that is airing Wednesday on  <hyperlink> Piers Morgan in which the CNN host asks His Holiness what leaders he respects. After bringing up Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama then moves on to a more unlikely politician.  <paragraph>  "I love President Bush," the Dalai Lama said.  "Which one?" Morgan asked.  "The younger one."   Shocked by the response, Morgan asked incredulously, "Really?"   "Yes, really," the Dalai Lama insisted, "I love him."  <paragraph>  ( <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Dalai Lama: I love George W. Bush)  <paragraph>  Those strong words from His Holiness surprise even conservatives like myself who faulted Bush for huge deficits and a reckless foreign policy. But reading this lavish praise from the likes of the Dalai Lama, Bono and Bob Geldof should remind narrow-minded leftists who view Mr. Bush through ideological blinders that turning political opponents into cartoon characters is the work of fools. <paragraph>  And for conservatives who have spent the past three years calling Barack Obama every name in the book, that applies to you as well. We can disagree with our political opponents without turning them into evil villains. As the Dalai Lama himself once famously said, "Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible."
From tea party to tepid |   <paragraph>  Absent a political earthquake, the GOP nomination outcome is set in stone. Willard Mitt Romney will be the Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012. And just as the red hot Republican Revolution of 1994 was followed by Bob Dole's ascension in 1996, the Tea Party Uprising of 2010 is being followed by the nomination of Obamacare's ideological architect.  <paragraph>  Regardless, the fat lady has sung. As conservative talker Hugh Hewitt declared on National Review Online last night, "The race for the GOP nomination is still over."  <paragraph>  University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato, writing for NRO's "The Corner" said this: <paragraph>  "Santorum has earned another run in 2016 or 2020. But it is three long weeks until the next set of primaries. He is guaranteed to lose four of five contests on that day, and he may even lose the delegate battle in Pennsylvania — a potentially crippling embarrassment for his future plans. Santorum has no real chance to stop Romney and may squander the admiration he has won in the GOP base.  <paragraph>  Too bad Mitt Romney's opponents are walking around like Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense." As former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford noted in a column for Fox News, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are not swayed by political logic or delegate math.  <paragraph>  "Mathematical certainties at this point mean nothing to Gingrich and have never meant anything to Santorum. If they did, Santorum would never have entered the race in the first place."  <paragraph>  As for Gingrich, the statement he released after last night's losses suggest the former speaker is planning to continue his fight all the way though Tampa.  <paragraph>  “Our party must commit itself to a bold, conservative platform. We cannot win on an etch-a-sketch platform that shows no principle or backbone.”  <paragraph>  And the beat goes on....
Finding common ground on education reform | <paragraph>   The reaction to our education town hall meeting held this morning in Ft. Lee, N.J., has been overwhelmingly positive. It was great to talk about education reform in a state where Newark's Democratic mayor, New Jersey's Republican governor and the country's Democratic president all consider themselves on the same side of reform.    <paragraph>   This "dogs and cats living together" moment was made more evident when Gov. Chris Christie began saying nice things about Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy's education team. The fact that Christie and Malloy spent much of last year fighting each other in the press made their kind words about each other all the more hopeful today. Other "odd couples" who found common ground today were American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and Harlem Village Academies CEO Deborah Kenny, as well as former DNC chairman Howard Dean and former D.C. schools superintendent Michelle Rhee.    <paragraph>   Today's Morning Joe town hall meeting on education showed that reforming America's schools may be one political cause that brings all sides together. And judging from today's conversations on Morning Joe, the left and right are moving closer together every day.    <paragraph>   To see video from this morning's town hall, head to    <hyperlink>    joe.msnbc.com.    <paragraph>   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misspelled Deborah Kenny's name.
Statement by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski regarding Pat Buchanan |  <paragraph>   "Everyone at Morning Joe considers     <hyperlink>    Pat Buchanan to be a friend and a member of the family. Even though we strongly disagree with the contents of Pat's latest book, Mika and I believe those differences should have been debated in public. An open dialogue with     <hyperlink>    Morning Joe regulars like Al Sharpton and Harold Ford, Jr. could have developed into an important debate on the future of race relations in America.  <paragraph>   Because we believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant, Mika and I strongly disagree with this     <hyperlink>    outcome. We understand that the parting was amicable. Still, we will miss Pat."
