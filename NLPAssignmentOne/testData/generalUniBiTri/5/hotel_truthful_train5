10/25/12 5:47 AM EDT | Two new polls scream 'advantage Obama' | <paragraph> Two polls released yesterday show President Obama stubbornly clinging to his electoral advantage. TIME Magazine released a new Ohio poll that has Mitt Romney trailing in the Buckeye State by 5 points. Last week's NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey also had Romney behind by 5. <paragraph> TIME's poll should rattle the nerves of Romney supporters because the results run contrary to Team Romney's ongoing claim that their internal polls show a dead heat in the Buckeye State. Maybe that's the case among voters planning to go to the polls on election day but it looks like early voters are tilting dramatically in the president's direction. If the TIME poll is accurate, it means Mitt Romney will have to grab most of Ohio's remaining undecided voters if he wants to win this critical battleground state. <paragraph> PPP released a Nevada survey yesterday that also shows President Obama holding a lead in this key swing state that remains outside the margin of error. Like Ohio, Nevada remains stubbornly in the Obama column. While Mitt Romney has made up ground in the three Southern swing states of Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, voters in Ohio, Nevada and Wisconsin seem do not seem inclined to be easily swept into Romney's camp. <paragraph> Despite President Obama's advantage, his top advisors say we will not see the full impact of the final debate for a few more days. But at least for today, President Obama is holding onto his swing state advantage. And you can be sure that advantage will hold steady at least until a next batch of polls are released later today.
10/23/12 5:04 PM EDT | A narrow Obama win or a Romney landslide | <paragraph> Mika, Willie and I have spent the past few weeks answering the same question from viewers, family members and friends. "Who's going to win the election??" <paragraph> After the first debate, that question was asked in the form of a plea from Democrats. Before that, Republicans grimly asked for their prognosis, resigned to the fact that the answer would not be satisfying. <paragraph> I spent most of the year telling those who asked that the dynamics of the race suggested a narrow Barack Obama win. But that all changed after the president's Denver debacle. After that meltdown, I am the first to admit I have no idea how this will turn out. <paragraph> But I do know this: Mitt Romney will win the presidency if he wins Ohio. That's because the Republican candidate is nailing down the Southern swing states that he has to win. With Florida, North Carolina and Virginia moving his way, the battle now moves to the Midwest. <paragraph> If Romney's momentum is strong enough to erase the 10-point deficit he once faced in Ohio, expect him to carry other swing states like Nevada and Colorado. <paragraph> That scenario would have been far more plausible had Mr. Romney turned in a stronger performance at last night's debate in Florida. As things stand today, Ohio is still a heavy lift for the GOP candidate and that means President Obama should still be considered a slight favorite to win reelection. <paragraph> But my gut tells me there are two likely scenarios: (1) President Obama will squeak out a narrow Electoral College victory or (2) Mitt Romney will carry Ohio and be swept into office by a comfortable margin. <paragraph> After practicing politics for 20 years, I suppose I would rather be in Mitt Romney's shoes than Barack Obama's. Incumbents who are under 50 percent two weeks out usually go down to defeat. <paragraph> But who knows? Maybe Barack Obama will bend history once again.
10/15/12 10:13 PM EDT | Romney's Electoral College gains | <paragraph> Is Mitt Romney surging ahead of Barack Obama in the battleground states that will elect the next president? USA Today says "yes" and insiders in the Democratic Party are growing more concerned by the day that the President's built-in advantage in the Electoral College has all but disappeared. <paragraph> A new USA Today/Gallup poll has Romney leading President Obama by 4 percentage points among likely voters in 12 battleground states. The reason? USA Today says women in these swing states are moving Mitt's way. Time Magazine's Mark Halperin is also reporting tonight in an Electoral College update that a top Democratic source is worrying for the first time that Ohio may be slipping out of the Obama column and moving toward the tossup pile. <paragraph> Halperin explains: <quotation> <paragraph> Just yesterday, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll had President Obama surging ahead of Mitt Romney and breaking past the 50 percent mark, so who knows what the next poll brings. But one thing is certain, the tightening race does give us all one more reason to tune into Tuesday night's presidential debate.
6/19/12 6:34 PM EDT  | 39 percent? | <paragraph> It was a startling announcement that got too little attention: Earlier this month the Federal Reserve issued findings showing that the median U.S. household lost nearly 39 percent of its wealth from 2007 to 2010. <paragraph> If you're looking for a missing decimal point--surely it's 3.9 percent, you might think--you're looking in vain. <paragraph> Anyone who cares about America's place in the 21st Century economy should find this 39 percent figure depressing for all the obvious reasons.  But that shocking statistic also makes our task all the more clear: we must grow our way back into confidence and prosperity. And we get to decide whether Obama or Romney has the best chance of achieving that. <paragraph> That's a hell of a debate. But the Fed numbers show that the winner of that battle will have a historic task on his hands come next January.
6/6/12 10:49 PM EDT | Scott Walker's winning ways | <picture>  <paragraph>  Soon after the 2010 elections, Mika and I had a long dinner with David Axelrod about what went wrong for Democrats. During the dinner, a Republican operative walked over to our table and asked me to get up and visit the next table to meet the man who was just elected governor in Wisconsin. I walked over, met Scott Walker and immediately found myself unimpressed.  <paragraph>  Walker seemed too shy and too uncomfortable in Washington. I thought to myself that this was the kind of guy who gets swept into office during an ideological landslide and then gets booted out when the electorate moves back to the center a few years later. I saw that happen to many of my 1994 classmates. I saw it happen to Democrats who got elected in 2006. And I was pretty sure I would see it happen to Walker.  <paragraph>  Within a few months of his inauguration, I was sure of my prediction. Scott Walker quickly found himself in the middle of a political firestorm by moving too abruptly on union reform. Even though I was ideologically sympathetic to his cause, this looked like one more Republican leader who allowed himself to be painted as a right-wing extremist.  <paragraph>  I invited the governor on "Morning Joe" and immediately asked him if he had made a mistake moving forward too quickly on his agenda. His answer was a stunner.  <paragraph>  <quotation>  <paragraph>  Then the governor started calmly explaining how he had failed to listen to enough of his constituents before moving against collective bargaining. This was coming from a leader who had just endured a barrage of nasty personal attacks from political opponents he had just crushed in the Wisconsin legislature. After thanking Scott at the end of what I expected to be a contentious interview, I turned to Mika and said, "Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong about that guy."  <paragraph>  Few politicians were so graceful in victory as Walker and even fewer learned from their mistakes as quickly as he did in 2011. That humility was on full display last night as Walker used his acceptance speech to thank God, lift up his family and praise his Democratic opponent while telling Wisconsin Republicans to work harder on bipartisan compromise. He even used his speech to admit again that he should have listened more before moving on union reform. The governor told his partisan followers that  <quotation>   and that  <quotation>   <paragraph>  After watching last night's victory speech, my opinion of the shy politician I met in Washington in 2010 changed again. I decided that Scott Walker just might be that rare type of leader who is able to move an electorate his way by being blessed with the perfect proportions of courage and humility.  <paragraph>  That was a winning formula in Wisconsin last night and could be the way forward for a party that has recently had the habit of unnecessarily provoking persuadable voters. Hopefully, the governor will learn to deal with all of the indignities Washington brings because his party and country may need him as part of a national ticket in the coming years.
6/2/12 12:55 PM EDT | The next great depression? |   <paragraph>  If the world slides into a global depression over the next year, consider yourself forewarned by the Wall Street Journal. Yesterday's edition was packed with so many grim headlines that one could be forgiven for believing that we could be seeing cash-filled wheelbarrows by the end of the summer.  <paragraph>  In what could have been called the Black Friday issue, the Journal reported on: - an Asian slowdown brought on by European woes - India's economy sputtering to a nine-year low - a continued economic slowdown in China - weakness coming out of South Korea and Australia - a growing banking crisis in Spain - a deepening of Greece's economic collapse - increased economic problems across Africa - the desperate plea of European bankers for a unified rescue fund   <paragraph>  Yet another WSJ story reported that President Obama was aggressively weighing in on the European debt crisis, urging EU leaders to make tough choices to prevent the kind of crisis that propelled him into the White House four years ago. The Journal wrote of a growing concern in the White House that a similar crisis could be responsible for his defeat four years after the September 15th meltdown.  <paragraph>  Adding to the grimness of Friday's morning edition was a jobs report that landed on Wall Street with a thud at 8:30 a.m.. Yesterday's depressing jobs report was terrible news for the president and the millions of Americans who are still struggling to find a job.  <paragraph>  The economic data released this week was not much better for some of the U.S.'s top employers.  <paragraph>  The screaming headline "Business Braces for Europe's Worst" was splashed across the top of the Journal's Marketplace section. Companies like McDonald's, Carnival and Goodrich are sure to see their earnings hit hard by a sagging European economy.  <paragraph>  That is bad news for U.S. workers and for a president who has five months left to prove that his policies have reversed an economic slide that he inherited in 2008. Chicago's argument keeps getting tougher to make every month, with the backdrop of an economy that seems to be growing weaker by the day.
5/28/12 10:12 AM EDT  | An enduring sacrifice few can understand |   <paragraph> I remember moving past the generals and politicians to greet grief-stricken family members who lost a loved one at Khobar Towers. The 1996 terrorist attack killed 19 U.S. servicemen stationed in Saudi Arabia and several of those killed in the attack were stationed at Eglin Air Force Base in the heart of my congressional district.  <paragraph>  I quietly shook hands with the parents who lost their sons, the wives who lost their husbands and the sisters who lost their brothers. And as is usually the case when military tragedies curse families, one can do little more in their presence than pray for the fallen and offer assistance for those family members left behind.  <paragraph>  I slowly made my way down the receiving line until I was stopped by the sight of a young boy who was staring ahead vacantly across the room, past the generals and politicians who were walking by to pay their last respects to his dad. My eyes began to well up at his sight and I moved quickly to hug the boy. All I could whisper was that I was so sorry for his loss. I moved away just as quickly to hide my eyes from him and go outside for the ceremony.  <paragraph>  The fact that the boy was the same age as my oldest son in 1996 is why I still remember that jarring encounter on this Memorial Day 16 years later. This morning I recall all I shared with my sons over those 16 years: the Little League games I got to coach, the birthday parties I got to attend, the Christmas Eve candlelight services I enjoyed with my family, the prom pictures I forced Joey and Andrew to endure while their dates smiled and they just stood there squirming in their misfitting tuxes.  <paragraph>  All these years later, I still pray to God every night that I will be around to see them graduate, get married, have children and move safely into middle age -- all the things this young boy would endure without his dad. I also pray that children of the fallen have loved ones to pick up the pieces and move them forward toward a fulfilled life, but I know that is not always the case.  <paragraph>  When we talk about the American heroes who give their all for their country, I wonder how many people realize that their sacrifice continues being paid every day. Then I wonder why Washington refuses to treat those heroes who come home with the respect they deserve.  <paragraph>  On this Memorial Day, let us hope that one day soon they will. May God bless our fallen heroes and their family members today and far into the future.
5/27/12 4:14 PM EDT | Time again for Obama to lead from behind |   <paragraph>  Today, Sunday morning newspapers around the world screamed with headlines announcing yet another tragedy out of Syria. Journalists inside the war-torn country report that forces aligned with Bashar al-Assad massacred at least 90 Syrians with indiscriminate mortar attacks on civilian targets; more than 30 children were among the dead.  <paragraph>  The massacre in Houla is another example of how deadly Kofi Annan's Syrian cease-fire has been for civilians who still believe the international community will actually do something to prevent further slaughter. After yesterday's attacks, Syrians have reason to become increasingly bitter at the United States for sitting back over the past year and doing very little while Assad murdered 10,000 of his own citizens.    <paragraph>  Imagine how difficult it must be for the mother of a Syrian child killed by Assad's bloodied hands to grasp the geopolitical complexities that compelled the United States to launch air attacks against Muammar Gadhafi's Libya (in the name of protecting civilians) while the same superpower has sat idly by while its enemy indiscriminately kills his fellow countrymen. The reality is that the Administration's Libya and Syria policies cannot be squared in a way that makes sense to even the most gifted foreign-policy analyst.   <paragraph>  It would be depressing to believe that the greatest sin 10,000 dead Syrians had on their heads before being killed was to have the bad luck of not being born in an oil-rich country like Libya. And yet I am not cynical enough to believe that such crude calculations enter the minds of American presidents.   <paragraph>  But with every unanswered massacre that Assad launches, Americans and members of the international community can be forgiven for possessing a healthy dose of skepticism.  <paragraph>  That's why it is time once again for Barack Obama to lead from behind. His patience toward Libya last year angered neoconservative hawks who would've preferred the president launch attacks first and ask questions later. But he wisely chose instead to give the Arab League and our European allies enough time and space to take the lead against Gadhafi's ruthless regime. It was then left, of course, to American men and women in uniform to help drive the Libyan dictator from power. They did just that, and the president was rightly praised for his shrewd handling of the crisis.   <paragraph>  The growing crisis in Syria calls for a similar approach. Fortunately, the president has already declared that Mr. Assad must go. His administration has also wisely continued to ramp up pressure on Russia.   <paragraph>  But the president must do more, by focusing intense pressure on allies and unbearable pressure on enemies to drive Bashar al-Assad from power. That outcome is not only a moral imperative. It is also in the United States long-term strategic interest.  <paragraph>  That is why it is time for a repeat performance from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
5/25/12 3:07 PM EDT | Gay marriage, abortion and the independent voter |   <paragraph>  With apologies to ideologues of all parties, the latest Gallup poll on abortion shows just how pragmatic American voters can be when it comes to social issues.  <paragraph>  That may come as news to extreme special interest groups on both sides of the aisle. After all, these organizations have made a good living through the years by pushing their own brand of morality on American voters. These advocacy groups have also contributed to the toxic environment in Washington by simplifying every issue and demonizing every opponent.  <paragraph>  Few issues have divided Washington and America more than abortion and gay marriage. And yet Americans are now declaring independence from rigid agendas by heading in opposite ideological directions in these two heated debates.  <paragraph>  According to recent surveys, voters are becoming more progressive on gay marriage. The divide-and-conquer strategy that worked for Republicans in 2004 will never again be as effective as it was during George W. Bush's reelection campaign.  <paragraph>  At the same time, voters are becoming more conservative on abortion. The latest Gallup poll shows that 50 percent of Americans identify themselves as pro-life. That's a 17 point jump from when the same question was asked by Gallup in 1996. A record low 41 percent of Americans surveyed now identify themselves as pro-choice. That is a 15 point drop since 1996.  <paragraph>  Despite large swings in the way voters identify themselves on this issue, politicians should also take note that the majority of Americans tell pollsters they still believe abortion should be legal in some cases.  <paragraph>  So what does it mean? Perhaps that attitudes on abortion are changing, but not overnight. The same is true of gay marriage, as Team Obama learned earlier this month. Chicago privately concedes that President Obama is now more likely to lose the swing state of North Carolina because of his recent statement on gay marriage.  <paragraph>  Republicans are just as likely to lose suburban women and other swing voters if they dart too far right on abortion over the next six months. The GOP presidential primary campaign underlined that fact in bright red ink earlier this year.  <paragraph>  Still, attitudes are changing on both issues. And any politician who believes he can blindly follow a tired party line will soon find himself out of touch and out of office.
5/21/12 9:25 PM EDT  | Chicago books mayor for telling truth |  <paragraph>  Only Nixon could go to China, only Clinton could pass welfare reform and only Cory Booker could draw blood by  <hyperlink>  calling out Barack Obama. <paragraph>  That's because Republicans have called President Obama every name in the book over the past four years --from Marxist to fascist to racist. During that time, the right-wing noise machine spewed out such a steady stream of insults toward Mr. Obama that most swing voters simply don't pay attention to those howlers who keep crying wolf.  <paragraph>  Enter <quotation>   Cory Booker.  <paragraph>  The formerly fast-rising Democratic star and Obama surrogate went on "Meet the Press" Sunday morning to blast his candidate's populist attacks on venture capitalism. In so doing, the Newark mayor committed a terrible gaffe by Washington standards.  <paragraph>  He told the truth.  <paragraph>  Now he will surely pay a steep political price for his honesty. Never mind the fact that many of the big money contributors who made Barack Obama's historic election possible four years ago continue to practice the same brand of capitalism that made Mitt Romney rich. And many of those contributors are being asked once again to support Barack Obama's campaign.  <paragraph>  Cory Booker may have been forced to  <hyperlink> produce a hostage video last night, but it is Barack Obama who remains handcuffed today to the same big money capitalists that he still blames for ruining America.
5/19/12 1:58 PM EDT  | These are not the Times to be biased | <paragraph>  Maybe I shouldn't be so tough on those I love. God knows I would have more friends in my own political party if I had kept my mouth shut while George W. Bush was running up trillions in debt and aping Woodrow Wilson on the world stage. But I can't help myself. Maybe I just expect more from those I love.  <paragraph>  Which brings me to the New York Times. I often criticize the Old Gray Lady despite the fact it's the one newspaper I must read daily.  <paragraph>  I expect its editorial page to reflect the liberal community it serves. And I endure its left-leaning story selection because it also brings the best writing and reporting in the world to my doorstep. But it tends to embarrass itself occasionally during heated presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>  The Times' public editor recently scolded his paper's past cheerleading for Barack Obama, and for good reason. The paper published separate profiles of John and Cindy McCain during the peak of the 2008 campaign that smeared the GOP nominee and his wife. When this kind of slanted reporting wins the day, I am as distressed at the Times' failings as I am when Republican politicians stop being conservative and start being radical. <paragraph>  This past week the Newspaper of Record ran a story above the fold on page one reporting that Republicans were preparing a new round of attacks on Barack Obama's relationship with Jeremiah Wright. They followed that Thursday story with a follow up article the next day. And then today, the Times' "Political Memo" stirred the pot again by writing this:  <paragraph>  A report in The New York Times on Thursday exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama’s onetime pastor, and his angry black-power sermons.  <paragraph>  Perhaps this news story might justify a three day roll out if, in fact, that narrative were accurate. Sadly, for the New York Times and Barack Obama's campaign, it is not.  <paragraph>  Despite what the Times claims, the undisputed facts are these: 1. There was no "secret plan" by "strategists" or "financiers" to push the Wright story, 2. The super pac in question asked advertisers to bring them ad ideas focused on the federal debt, 3. The ad man who pitched the idea to the super pac conceded that the group did not want proposals that dealt with anything other than fiscal issues, 4. Mitt Romney and his campaign had nothing to do with anything involving this ad. 5. The Republican Party had nothing to do with anything involving this pitch.   <paragraph>  Anyone who has spent any time working on a political campaign knows that terrible ideas bubble up and are popped by smart managers every five minutes or so. The fact that the New York Times decided to seize on a stupid idea by a guy not connected to (a) the super pac, (b) the RNC or (c) the Romney campaign shows just how much of a stretch it was to put Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg's story on the top of page one.  <paragraph>  Zeleny and Rutenberg are great reporters. And their story calling out a single strategist for pushing this self-destructive idea should find its way into the news stream. But until the New York Times begins publishing the moronic ideas of Democratic ad men making pitches to George Soros or Ted Turner, they should limit their breathless attacks against a political party they clearly oppose.  <paragraph>  This responsibility falls on the shoulders of editors who need to show a bit more partisan restraint on page one during election years. Such restraint will help them avoid the perception that they are shamelessly cheerleading for Democrats while maintaining the loyalty of many readers who do not share the editors' political views.
5/17/12 9:51 AM EDT | The widening partisan divide |   <paragraph>  There they go again.  <paragraph>  The White House and Congress are starting to circle each other in another mindless default dawdle while Greece teeters, Italy shakes, Spain splinters and France frets. The Eurozone's southern states are staggering toward insolvency while millions of Europeans cope with Depression-style suffering.  <paragraph>  The Greek political system is suffering a nervous breakdown, with spoiled voters almost certainly assuring an economic meltdown and Greece's exit from the EU.  <paragraph>  Spain's economy is strapped with a 25 percent unemployment rate that tops out at 50 percent for that nation's young workers. The situation has gotten so bad that its prime minister is now fretting that his country may soon be shut out of world markets. Italy's debt now equals a staggering 120 percent of its nation's GDP while the country suffers through three straight quarters of economic decline.  <paragraph>  Now the rest of Europe waits nervously to see how the dominoes falling in Athens will affect Rome, Paris and Berlin.  <paragraph>  Meanwhile, U.S. politicians continue playing the same insipid Washington games that have led our country to a record $16 trillion debt. Over the past 24 hours, GOP House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid exchanged barbs about yet another default showdown, while President Obama called both sides into the White House so he could quickly leak details of his scolding lecture to lawmakers.  <paragraph>  That's sure to seal the deal, Mr. President.  <paragraph>  Taken together, the events of the past 24 hours prove that our national leaders remain locked in trench warfare where neither side dares to cross the ever widening partisan divide.  <paragraph>  Politically, some House members will probably benefit from such reckless, ideological behavior. But the president will not. It will be incumbent upon him to show independent voters just how aggressively he will fight over the next four years to bring deficit spending under control. Leave it to Bill Clinton to understand the moment at hand and figure out how to capitalize politically. Tuesday night, while mere politicians were lobbing spit balls at each other, the former president addressed the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and declared that facing down the budget crisis should be "front and center" in the 2012 campaign.  <paragraph>  Before left wing bloggers attack Mr. Clinton, they should remember that this is the same Democratic president who bloodied his Republican enemies by declaring that  <quotation>    <paragraph>  Of course it wasn't by a long shot but then-President Clinton knew that the best way to win independent voters away from the GOP was by avoiding the label of "big government liberal." He signed a Republican welfare reform bill, promised to balance the budget and then got easily reelected in 1996.  <paragraph>  Barack Obama needs to perform a similar magic trick 16 years later.  <paragraph>  Despite the Republican Party's gallant efforts over the last six months to destroy their brand and help reelect their enemy, President Obama still trails a listless opponent in many polls. He is scoring poorly with voters on the economy. And too many independent voters dismiss him (for good reason) as a big spending liberal. To turn things around, the White House needs to follow Clinton's example and set up its GOP opponents.  <paragraph>  That will require a bold strategy and a new kind of thinking at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It will demand a big idea on long-term debt reduction and short term growth. And that bold strategy will include President Obama's strong endorsement of the Simpson-Bowles plan to save America from economic insolvency. Liberals will protest, Democratic candidates will squeal, but it is the White House's best chance to put Mitt Romney in a corner and win over independent voters.  <paragraph>  It really shouldn't be that hard considering that Mr. Obama would only be endorsing the conclusions of his own debt commission.
5/2/12 9:09 PM EDT | Newt Gingrich's real legacy |    <paragraph>  With Newt Gingrich's belated exit from the Republican presidential campaign, now is a good time to ask what impact his vertiginous race will have on his legacy.   <paragraph>  My guess? Not much.  <paragraph>  Sure, we learned that the former speaker is undisciplined on the campaign trail, has a tumultuous past and is often ideologically inconsistent. But that's not news to anyone who worked with Mr. Gingrich for more than a week while he served in Congress. And Newt Gingrich served in Congress for a very long time.  <paragraph>  Instead, 2012 is just one more reminder of how in politics, a politician's past is always prologue. For Newt's campaign staff, that proved to be bad news.  <paragraph>  (<hyperlink> PHOTOS: Newt Gingrich's career)  <paragraph>  But despite the withering critiques of many (including myself), give Mr. Gingrich his due. History will record him as one of the most significant Republican figures of the last 50 years. For a short while in the 1990s, Newt Gingrich bent history. <paragraph>  He led Republicans to a majority in the House for the first time in 40 years,  He led the fight to balance the budget for the first time in a generation, He helped balance that budget for four consecutive years for the first time since the 1920s, He rammed through welfare reform despite initial opposition from Bill Clinton and the Democrats, and He extended the life of Medicare when Democrats chose to demagogue the issue  <paragraph>  Of course, many will also blame the Gingrich speakership for the poisonous atmosphere that infects Washington today, but vicious personal attacks in American politics predated Newt's 1994 rise by about 220 years. And since many of the same people who judged Gingrich for his take-no-hostages approach remained silent when Ted Kennedy accused Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork of supporting segregation, back-alley abortions and midnight police raids, those critiques are not worth the paper on which they are written.  <paragraph>  Newt Gingrich may have turned negative campaigning into a dark art form, but he was not its inventor.  <paragraph>  Newt's more lasting legacy will be what he accomplished in 1995 and 1996. For those achievements, Speaker Gingrich will long be remembered as the man who brought the Reagan Revolution to the Legislative Branch. That legacy remains secure tonight despite the ending of a very sloppy campaign.
5/1/12 9:26 PM EDT | Politics and the endless war |  <paragraph>  The president's prime-time address tonight put a bow on the political gift Osama bin Laden's death provided Team Obama.  <paragraph>  Did the White House politicize the terror chief's death? Of course. Is it breaking news that an administration would do such a thing? Of course not.  <paragraph>  In 1960, John Kennedy created a missile gap with the Soviets out of thin air to defeat Richard Nixon.  <paragraph>  Four years later, LBJ shamelessly used his "Daisy" ad to suggest that a Goldwater administration would cause a nuclear war.  <paragraph>  In 1968, Richard Nixon lied about a secret plan to get out of Vietnam.  <paragraph>  In 2002, Karl Rove and the GOP used September 11th as a wedge issue against Democratic candidates.  <paragraph>  And in 2012, President Obama is using the killing of Osama bin Laden as a political tool.  <paragraph>  If you are shocked by such things, get over it. Be more concerned  with the president's declaration that U.S. troops will be in Afghanistan until 2024. That reality means Americans who were not even born on Sept. 11, 2001, will be occupying Afghanistan 20 years after those attacks. Never mind that the epicenter of Al Qaeda's operation has moved to Yemen or that U.S. taxpayers are doling out $2 billion a week on a war whose main purpose is propping up one of the most corrupt regimes on the face of the Earth.  <paragraph>  Making matters worse is the fact that Mr. Obama's opponents in the GOP want to stay longer. <paragraph>  The takeaway of President Obama's speech tonight is simple. The neocons won, the troops lost and the endless war grinds on in a land that humbled the Soviet Union, the British Empire and Alexander the Great. Good luck with that, Mr. President.
4/30/12 9:03 PM EDT | Hoover, Carter and cheap shots |  <paragraph>   <quotation>  wrote Finley Peter Dunne in an 1895 newspaper column explaining how Washington is not for the weak-hearted. And Mr. Dunne was right.  <paragraph>  All those hoping to find charity, love and justice on the campaign trail would do best to seek out the nearest church pew to rest their weary bones. That is because young politicians are taught daily just how rough the sport can be.  <paragraph>  In Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy's new book The President's Club, we see time and again how ex-presidents have been swept aside with brutish efficiency by the incoming president - whether it was Dwight Eisenhower coldly dispatching his former boss Harry Truman or John Kennedy dismissing Ike eight years later because he believed wrongly that the old general was hopelessly out of touch.   <paragraph>  But one of the most glaring examples of a president throwing a high, inside fastball on one of his predecessors was after Harry Truman had used Herbert Hoover from 1945 through 1948 to save millions of Europeans from starving after World War II. Truman also tapped Hoover to reorganize the federal government in a way that dramatically impacts even Barack Obama today. The alliance between Truman and Hoover was historic and, before long, the formerly disgraced GOP president became one of the most-admired men in America.   <paragraph>  Then came the 1948 election.  <paragraph>  Although Hoover gave the president his word that he would remain positive throughout the election, Gibbs and Duffy tell us that Harry Truman unloaded on the man who helped him save Europe from starvation and Soviet influence. On the campaign trail he would blame Hoover and the Republicans for causing the Great Depression while privately he would say, <quotation>    <paragraph>  But for Truman, politics was a tough game played by tough men, so he didn't give his strategy a second thought. And although Herbert Hoover was hurt by his friend's attacks, he swallowed his pride and continued his efforts reorganizing the executive branch for Truman and his successors.  <paragraph>  Given the long history of former presidents being used as political punching bags, I suppose I should not be surprised that these kind of attacks continue today. But I do wish ex-presidents would show the dignity and grace of George H.W. Bush in respecting the office of the presidency so much that they would choose to refrain from besmirching a member of the President's Club.  <paragraph>  I know this sounds old-fashioned and a bit out of touch with the realities of the 24/7 culture but I still revere the presidency even if I have been less than thrilled with the performance of some of its recent occupants.  <paragraph>  Which leads to a story that POLITICO is covering today regarding a man who hopes to become a member of the President's Club next January. Today, we heard Mitt Romney take a shot at the 39th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter. In responding to a reporter's question as to whether Romney would have ordered an attack on Osama bin Laden, the Republican front-runner said that  <quotation>     <paragraph>  That a GOP candidate would use Carter as a political target is not a surprise. We Republicans - and I include myself here - have been using President Carter as a political target for as long as Democrats lashed out at Hoover. But considering that Carter did the unthinkable by 2012 standards last week and praised Mitt Romney, I found his cheap shot at President Carter to be a bit jarring.  <paragraph>  Also, I wonder if there should be a statute of limitations on the political attacks the 39th president has to absorb. As a conservative who has been criticizing the former president for almost four decades now, I say enough is enough. All one has to do is read a few pages of Jimmy Carter's White House Diary or his recent Bible guide to get a better understanding of the challenges that constantly faced the man from Plains when he lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  <paragraph>  His were the same kind of monumental crises that Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton stared down daily. And while I will be the first to say that the people and the press have every right to challenge a sitting president every step of the way, I would suggest that after a president has been out of the Oval Office for 30 years, politicians should look elsewhere for cheap shots.
4/25/12 7:35 PM EDT | George W. Bush's friends on the left |   <paragraph>  For a president who left office loathed by progressives and most of polite society, <hyperlink> George W. Bush continues to gain admirers among those whom liberals admire most.  <paragraph>   <hyperlink>  U2 frontman and legendary do-gooder Bono shocked many when he told Jon Stewart that George W. Bush did an  <quotation>  job in his work involving AIDS in Africa.  <paragraph>   <quotation>   Bono told the host, <quotation>   <paragraph>  Another secular saint of the left, Sir Bob Geldof, has been even more direct in his praise of the conservative ex-president.  <paragraph>  Geldof told reporters that he was  <quotation>   by the media's refusal to report the truth about Bush's good works, saying that when it came to saving Africa, George W. Bush  <quotation>    <paragraph>   <quotation>   he said. <quotation>   <paragraph>   <quotation>  Geldof told reporters.  <paragraph>  Then there is the interview that is airing Wednesday on  <hyperlink> Piers Morgan in which the CNN host asks His Holiness what leaders he respects. After bringing up Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama then moves on to a more unlikely politician.  <paragraph>   <quotation>  the Dalai Lama said.  <quotation>   Morgan asked.  <quotation>  Shocked by the response, Morgan asked incredulously, <quotation>      <quotation>  the Dalai Lama insisted, <quotation>  <paragraph>  ( <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Dalai Lama: I love George W. Bush)  <paragraph>  Those strong words from His Holiness surprise even conservatives like myself who faulted Bush for huge deficits and a reckless foreign policy. But reading this lavish praise from the likes of the Dalai Lama, Bono and Bob Geldof should remind narrow-minded leftists who view Mr. Bush through ideological blinders that turning political opponents into cartoon characters is the work of fools. <paragraph>  And for conservatives who have spent the past three years calling Barack Obama every name in the book, that applies to you as well. We can disagree with our political opponents without turning them into evil villains. As the Dalai Lama himself once famously said, <quotation>
4/16/12 8:43 PM EDT | In denial about debt crisis |   <paragraph>   With George Soros warning of a growing European crisis, the economic clouds that have been forming over Washington for years are growing darker by the day. While Soros fears that Europe's austerity measures will lead to a financial meltdown in the EU, at least European governments are trying something, anything, to stem the debt crisis.  <paragraph>  Stateside, today's events in Congress show just how ill-equipped our government is to face the coming storm.   <paragraph>  President Obama pushed for a Senate vote today on the Buffett Rule as a way to get rich Americans to pay more taxes. Of course, the president always knew the rule was more gimmick than economic panacea. He also knew it would never pass out of the least productive Senate in 20 years.   <paragraph>  Not to be outdone, House Republicans are pushing for a vote on a tax cut for businesses with less than 500 employees. Like the Buffett Rule, the Eric Cantor-backed tax cut has no chance of passing both chambers and ending up on the president's desk.  <paragraph>  The Washington Post summed up the parties' political gimmickry this afternoon: <quotation>  <paragraph>  To drive home the point that legislating is now little more than campaigning by different means, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer used the occasion of today's vote to suggest the provision's name should be changed to "The Romney Rule" because the presumptive GOP nominee is so rich.  <paragraph>  With all the game playing that is going on inside the Beltway, it is fair for voters to ask whether any adults are left working in a town that is always concerned with winning the next election rather than the new century.
4/9/12 5:50 PM EDT | Economic help for Obama |   <paragraph>  The Wall Street Journal editorial page usually has little good to say about <hyperlink>  President Obama's economic agenda. But today's Journal was brimming with good news for a White House facing reelection during tough economic times. From front to back, the WSJ was filled with upbeat  <hyperlink>   economic news. Considering Friday's disappointing jobs numbers, the good news must have been a welcome respite for the White House.  <paragraph>  The paper's lead article showcased a study declaring that U.S. companies were emerging stronger from the Great Recession than they were even before the 2008 financial meltdown. The Journal quoted Wells Fargo's former chief economist who said the last few years have made U.S. companies  <quotation>  That positive sentiment was backed by a WSJ analysis that showed sales, profits and employment higher among the Standard and Poor's companies than in 2007.  <paragraph>  That front page story was coupled with hopeful headlines from the Journal's opinion pages. Historian Walter Russell Mead's op-ed "The Myth of America's Decline" argued that, while power has become dispersed among more global players (  <hyperlink>  China, India,  <hyperlink>  Brazil, Turkey, Japan and Europe), the United States remains the "Chairman of the Board" on most global matters.  <paragraph>  Next to Mead's article was an opinion page headline asking  <quotation>  Even though the article warns of a coming fiscal cliff in 2013, most incumbents would put this op-ed under the "Just-Spell-My-Name-Right" category.  <paragraph>  If opinion writers spend the next year haggling over who should get the credit for America's improving economy, Barack Obama will be a happy man and Republicans will start planning for 2014.
4/8/12 8:56 PM EDT | The message of Jesus |  <paragraph>  With the holiest week of the year coming to an end, now is a good time to reflect on the message of Jesus that has been twisted in knots by televangelists and politicians in our time.   <paragraph>  Jesus is not about getting rich. He's about feeding the poor.  <paragraph>  Jesus doesn't care about putting your favorite politician first. He cares about you putting yourself last.  <paragraph>  He doesn't want you to listen to self-righteous televangelists or self-promoting politicians. Instead, he wants you to read his words and learn the truth. And for the purposes of those who read this column, Jesus never focused on politics. He remained silent on gay marriage, liberation theology or abortion wars.  But he did command us to love others, forgive others and serve others.  <paragraph>  Then he told us we should love others more than we love ourselves, that we should love our enemies, that we must turn the other cheek, that the peacemakers are blessed and that we must focus more on our own sins instead of judging the faults of others.  <paragraph>  And when Jesus' disciples asked what they needed to do to get to Heaven, his answer was simple: care for the poor, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, give water to the thirsty, visit those in prison and bring hope to the hopeless.  <paragraph>  That is a radically different message than the one we hear from popular culture and misguided ministers. But that message contained in Matthew 25 remains the heart of the Son of God's message 2,000 years after he rose from the grave.  <paragraph>  That's also a message that sinners like myself must always remember and be challenged by every day.
4/4/12 5:45 AM EDT  | From tea party to tepid |   <paragraph>  Absent a political earthquake, the GOP nomination outcome is set in stone. Willard Mitt Romney will be the Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012. And just as the red hot Republican Revolution of 1994 was followed by Bob Dole's ascension in 1996, the Tea Party Uprising of 2010 is being followed by the nomination of Obamacare's ideological architect.  <paragraph>  Regardless, the fat lady has sung. As conservative talker Hugh Hewitt declared on National Review Online last night, <quotation>  <paragraph>  University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato, writing for NRO's "The Corner" said this: <paragraph>   <quotation>   <paragraph>  Too bad Mitt Romney's opponents are walking around like Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense." As former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford noted in a column for Fox News, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are not swayed by political logic or delegate math.  <paragraph>   <quotation>    <paragraph>  As for Gingrich, the statement he released after last night's losses suggest the former speaker is planning to continue his fight all the way though Tampa.  <paragraph>   <quotation>  <paragraph>  And the beat goes on....
3/31/12 1:57 PM EDT | The politics of justice |  <paragraph>  At the beginning of this week's momentous Supreme Court arguments, allies of the Affordable Health Care Act were predicting a rout for their side. Judicial experts even told the New York Times (and Morning Joe) that they would not be surprised if the White House won the case by an 8-1 vote.  <paragraph>  Much has changed since Monday. Now many expect the Supreme Court to strike down the individual mandate and possibly throw out the entire law. But just as I was skeptical when liberals were overconfident at the beginning of the week, I find it equally unrealistic for conservatives to expect to be given a clear cut victory.  <paragraph>  I still expect this case to come down to Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote. And while Kennedy gave conservatives the question of the week ( <quotation>  ), the moderate justice's history shows how hard it is to define his judicial philosophy.  <paragraph>  Court observers have long accused Kennedy of being influenced by what Federal Judge Lawrence Silberman once famously called the "Greenhouse Effect," a term coined to describe conservatives who compromise their principles in exchange for fawning press coverage from the New York Times--named in honor of former Times reporter Linda Greenhouse.  <paragraph>  The phenomenon of "playing to the crowds" has been in decline in recent years, with the court settling into a more ideologically predictable routine.  <paragraph>  Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito follow a more "conservative" line and do not give a damn what the New York Times editorial page has to say. The same can be said of Ginsburg, Kagan, Breyer and Sotomayor, who can be pigeonholed more often than not in the "liberal" camp.  <paragraph>  These days, only Anthony Kennedy moves freely across the political divide, and critics say he often does so with an eye less on the law before him than on his longterm legacy.  <paragraph>  One of the worst examples of the Supreme Court taking political considerations into their legal decisions came in the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where Anthony Kennedy and two other justices admitted as much in their decision.  <paragraph>  Writing for the three judge plurality, Sandra Day O'Connor based her decision to uphold Roe v. Wade on the assertion that women now relied on abortion so much that to allow states to regulate it in a restrictive manner would create chaos. Even more disturbing was O'Connor and Kennedy's bizarre claim that upholding Roe was required if the Court hoped to protect its institutional legitimacy.  <paragraph>  The Court wrote, <quotation>  <paragraph>  As Notre Dame professor of law O. Carter Snead told me earlier this week, legal commentators across the ideological spectrum denounced the ruling as an abrogation of judicial authority without even the pretense of sound constitutional reasoning.  <paragraph>  That Kennedy and O'Connor would admit in a Supreme Court decision that they feared reversing constitutional error because of political recriminations should be shocking to even the most casual observer of the Court.  <paragraph>  Why does this matter now? Because the only lesson Anthony Kennedy has learned from Casey is that one should not admit publicly to caring more about political considerations than constitutional law.  <paragraph>  For the moment, conservatives can count themselves lucky that 67% of Americans want the Court to overturn the President's health care law. But if those numbers change as its repeal begins to look more likely, Anthony Kennedy may start looking for guidance from the crowds and the New York Times editorial page. When that happens, all legal reasoning takes a back seat to pure politics.
3/26/12 1:38 PM EDT | Not conservative enough |   <paragraph>  In the  <hyperlink>  New York Times this Sunday, author Kevin Baker echoed the sentiment of most in the mainstream media that the Republican Party's biggest problem over the past few years has been a lurch to the right. When you judge the party by its bottom line, the fact is that the GOP has not been conservative enough.  <paragraph>  What is too conservative about spending the past decade doubling the national debt?   <paragraph>  How is an unpaid for $7 trillion Medicare expansion a run to the right?  <paragraph>  Will most historians look back on a party who promised to end tyranny across the globe, use American troops as the world's 9-1-1 and engage in nation building on an unprecedented level consider Bush Republicans too conservative or too Wilsonian? Don't waste your time answering. The verdict is obvious. <paragraph>  And for all the weeping and gnashing of teeth I have had to endure over the radicalism of this tea party Congress, to my worried liberal friends I say “take a valium and relax.” This right wing, radical, reactionary tea party crew has meekly gone along with their statist party leaders far too often for my tastes. As a result, they added $1 trillion to the national debt their first year in power and got outmaneuvered by President Barack Obama at every turn.  <paragraph>  Too many in the media (and the conservative movement) have been distracted by stupid statements that have been streaming out of a few Republicans' mouths instead of keeping their eyes on the bottom line. When you focus on the one issue that really matters -- individual freedom vs. state expansion -- the GOP fails every test on true, blue conservatism.   <paragraph>  And now the party is in the process of nominating the man who was the architect of Obama's health care law.   <paragraph>  Too conservative? Actually, not conservative enough.   <paragraph>  ( <video> See my video blog below on the topic)
3/21/12 7:50 AM EDT | Is Romney's fate Kristol clear? |  <paragraph>   While you were sleeping last night, most commentators called the GOP presidential fight for Methodical Mitt. Last night's win in Illinois was one of the cleaner victories for Team Romney though University of Virginia's Larry Sabato commented that it was     <quotation>       <paragraph>   Still, Sabato and others on National Review's Symposium posted early this morning concluded that the Republican race was all but over.    <paragraph>   Hugh Hewitt wrote that     <quotation>  <paragraph>   The National Review's Jim Geraghty said     <quotation>   <paragraph>   Time Magazine's Mark Halperin called the race for Romney. And given an April calendar that favors Mitt and the fundraising shortcomings of the other candidates, Mark may be right.    <paragraph>   Still, hope springs eternal for those hoping for a conservative knight in shining armor to emerge from Tampa, though some of us are starting to sound like Japanese soldiers burrowed into Pacific islands ready to fight a battle whose outcome is already determined.    <paragraph>   But don't expect Bill Kristol to march meekly behind the Republican Party's flawed front runner.    <paragraph>   This morning, Kristol told readers why Mitt Romney may have won the battle but conservatives are likely to lose the political war this fall with Barack Obama.    <paragraph>   <quotation>   <paragraph>   Put me in the Kristol camp. Faced with the historic opportunity to retain the House, take the Senate, win the White House and reshape the Supreme Court for a generation, the Republican Party seems destined to nominate a candidate they do not even like.
3/2/12 2:06 PM EST | Finding common ground on education reform | <paragraph>   The reaction to our education town hall meeting held this morning in Ft. Lee, N.J., has been overwhelmingly positive. It was great to talk about education reform in a state where Newark's Democratic mayor, New Jersey's Republican governor and the country's Democratic president all consider themselves on the same side of reform.    <paragraph>   This "dogs and cats living together" moment was made more evident when Gov. Chris Christie began saying nice things about Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy's education team. The fact that Christie and Malloy spent much of last year fighting each other in the press made their kind words about each other all the more hopeful today. Other "odd couples" who found common ground today were American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and Harlem Village Academies CEO Deborah Kenny, as well as former DNC chairman Howard Dean and former D.C. schools superintendent Michelle Rhee.    <paragraph>   Today's Morning Joe town hall meeting on education showed that reforming America's schools may be one political cause that brings all sides together. And judging from today's conversations on Morning Joe, the left and right are moving closer together every day.    <paragraph>   To see video from this morning's town hall, head to    <hyperlink>    joe.msnbc.com.    <paragraph>   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misspelled Deborah Kenny's name.
2/22/12 4:46 PM EST | Just your average, run of the mill blog on state-sanctioned vaginal probes | <paragraph>   Great news out of Richmond, VA for Republicans who actually like winning general elections. Late word today that Governor     <hyperlink>    Bob McDonnell has effectively killed a bill that would have sanctioned state-ordered vaginal probes for women seeking to engage in a legal activity.  <paragraph>   This afternoon the Governor released the following statement:    <quotation>      <paragraph>   Regardless of your position on abortion, Bob McDonnell's move makes it more likely that Republicans can take the state out of Barack Obama's column this fall. It also keeps the Virginia governor in the running for VP.  <paragraph>   No word yet on whether Virginia's GOP legislators will now attempt to alienate the rest of the Commonwealth's voters by ordering state-sanctioned anal probes for men seeking public funding for their Viagra supplies.
2/14/12 7:00 PM EST | The truth about entitlement spending | <paragraph>   If you want to know why Republicans and Democrats can't make progress on long-term deficit reduction, take a look at the segment below from Morning Joe. In our roundtable discussion, my good friend Jeffrey Sachs (I need to underline that point before you actually watch the segment) claims that entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not cause the national debt to balloon over the next generation.   <paragraph>   Despite my great respect for Dr. Sachs, the Columbia professor's math doesn't seem to add up. <paragraph>   Financier and former Obama Car Czar Steve Rattner came to play today with handy charts that show entitlement spending devouring 40% of federal spending in 2012. Within the decade, that number expands to 54%, and goes much higher in the out years. Steve also described a crowding out of federal investment in discretionary programs like education, R&D and infrastructure because of an ever-growing entitlement system fueled by an aging population and rising health care costs.  <paragraph>   Dr. Sachs did admit that entitlement spending was on a sharp upward trajectory but was unwilling to embrace the type of reforms that I believe will prevent the collapse of Medicare in the future.  <paragraph>   But progressives are not alone in their collective state of denial regarding Medicare. In one of the most depressing poll results registered over the past few years, self-described Tea Party members were surveyed last spring     <hyperlink>    in a Marist poll and asked if they supported Medicare spending reforms. A pathetic 70% said     <quotation>    proving once again that when it comes to entitlement programs, some Americans just don't want to hear the truth.   <paragraph>   But the truth is that Medicare and Medicaid are the biggest drivers of America's national debt over the next generation. And that is not a matter of ideology. That is a matter of math. <video> 
2/14/12 2:25 PM EST | Crunch time for Romney | <paragraph>   In case you missed the show today, please see the video below of our discussion regarding the current state of the GOP race. The Michigan primary is exactly two weeks away, and several new polls show it is officially crunch time for the Romney campaign. What seemed only weeks ago to be a foregone conclusion for the former Massachusetts governor is shaping up to be an epic battle.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    American Research Group - Santorum with a 7 point lead  <hyperlink>    Public Policy Polling - Santorum with a 15 point lead     <paragraph>   <video>
2/17/12 3:36 PM EST | Statement by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski regarding Pat Buchanan |  <paragraph>   "Everyone at Morning Joe considers     <hyperlink>    Pat Buchanan to be a friend and a member of the family. Even though we strongly disagree with the contents of Pat's latest book, Mika and I believe those differences should have been debated in public. An open dialogue with     <hyperlink>    Morning Joe regulars like Al Sharpton and Harold Ford, Jr. could have developed into an important debate on the future of race relations in America.  <paragraph>   Because we believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant, Mika and I strongly disagree with this     <hyperlink>    outcome. We understand that the parting was amicable. Still, we will miss Pat."
4/7/12 8:21 PM EDT | Subtlety at the Times this holy week |    <paragraph>       <picture>   <paragraph>   You have to give the New York Times editors credit. With 2 billion Christians worldwide to choose from, they found a small group of pilgrims in Spain looking like exaggerated versions of Ku Klux Klan members to place on their front page on this Holy Weekend. It would be hard to imagine the Times editors finding  a group of worshipping Christians that would appear more ghoulish to Times readers than the image chosen.    <paragraph>   Very subtle.
2/13/12 1:07 AM EST | My new POLITICO blog, all I ever needed | <paragraph>   Thanks so much for taking a look at my Politico blog. <paragraph>   Like Navin R. Johnson seeing his name in the phone book for the first time, I feel like this is the lucky break I've been waiting for all my life. My blog will delight you and your extended family with stories of European futbol matches that end in 0-0 ties, underground bands for whom neither you nor your friends have ever heard, and inspiring stories regaling the glories of my time in Congress 47 years ago.   <paragraph>   I will also do my best to let you know what's really happening behind the scenes in Congress, the White House and in the media world. I'll also write about the things that really matter the most to me -- like my ashtray, and these matches, and the remote control, and the paddle ball... and this lamp. That's all I need, is this lamp....and this blog.   <paragraph>   Best, Joe
