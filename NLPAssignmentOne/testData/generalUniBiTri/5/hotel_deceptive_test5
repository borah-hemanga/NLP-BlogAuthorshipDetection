11/20/12 11:26 AM EST  | The GOP's 2012 diversity disaster | <picture>   <paragraph>  Florida Republican Rep. Allen West’s   <hyperlink>  concession Tuesday makes it official: The 2012 election was a disaster for the GOP’s efforts to diversify the face of the party.  <paragraph>  The number of African-American Republicans in Congress, which stood to double thanks to several highly competitive candidates, was instead cut in half. In addition to West’s reelection loss, top House prospects Vernon Parker in Arizona and Mia Love in Utah also fell short, leaving Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina as the lone black GOP House member in the 113th Congress.  <paragraph>  In a year when a record number of Hispanics were elected to Congress, Republicans also ended up losing two of their already small contingent: Reps. Francisco Canseco of Texas and David Rivera of Florida, both of whom were defeated in their bids for a second term.  <paragraph>  In addition, the party failed to elect one of its most promising Hispanic candidates, former California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado, and saw GOP Gov. Luis Fortuño defeated in Puerto Rico.  <paragraph>  In the Senate, which will have a record number of women next year, the number of female Republican senators declined by one. While Republican Deb Fischer was elected to Nebraska’s open Senate seat, five other female GOP nominees lost — placing the number of GOP women in the Senate at 4.  <paragraph>  Meanwhile, Democrats elected 4 new women and re-elected 6 female Senate incumbents, giving the party 16 female senators.  <paragraph>  There was one promising sign this year for the GOP amid the lost opportunities: The election of Ted Cruz to an open Texas Senate seat. His victory means the party now boasts Hispanic senators in two of the nation’s largest states (the other is Florida’s Marco Rubio).  <paragraph>  Since the GOP can also point to two Hispanic governors (Democrats have none), Republicans are now arguably better positioned than Democrats to put a Hispanic on the presidential ticket in 2016.
11/13/12 7:10 PM EST  | Scott Brown's comeback tour |  <picture>  <paragraph>  He might have lost his Senate seat last week, but Scott Brown is still very much in the game.  <paragraph>  Between the 2014 Massachusetts governor’s race and the swirling rumors regarding a possible Cabinet position for Sen. John Kerry, several promising   <hyperlink>  opportunities might soon present themselves to Brown.  <paragraph>  In a media availability Tuesday in Washington, the senator dodged questions about his future.  <paragraph>   <quotation>  <hyperlink>  Brown said. <quotation>    <paragraph>  Given his track record — a giant special election upset and a respectable loss in his bid to win a full term — and the Massachusetts GOP’s thin bench, Brown has far more leverage than the typical election loser in choosing an avenue of return.  <paragraph>  If he’s interested in returning to the Senate, however, Brown is looking at a daunting scenario. If Kerry steps down, Brown would have to run next year in a 2013 Senate special election, followed by the regularly scheduled 2014 election for the full six-year term. That would make four grueling statewide campaigns in five years in a heavily Democratic state — the 2010 special, the 2012 general election against Elizabeth Warren, a 2013 special and a 2014 general.
11/9/12 6:30 AM EST  | The GOP's big city problem | <picture> <paragraph>  There’s at least one ray of hope for the GOP in Mitt Romney’s loss Tuesday: Exit polls show he won back the suburbs from President Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Romney won the suburbs 50 percent to 48 percent, recapturing them after Obama won the crabgrass frontier by the same margin in 2008.  <paragraph>  It’s an important symbolic win for the GOP since, with few exceptions, the suburbs have been the province of the Republican Party in post-war presidential elections.  <paragraph>  But Romney’s victory margin in the suburbs wasn’t by nearly enough, and it underscores a problem confronting the GOP. While the suburbs powered the GOP for decades, they also created a false sense of security — and a political dependency — that threatens the party’s future in an era of when most of the older suburbs are firmly in the Democratic column and many of the newer ones are up for grabs.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  Sommer Mathis of the Atlantic Cities website puts it succinctly:  <quotation>    <paragraph>  Even if you don’t buy the recent analysis that cities are growing faster than the suburbs, the big city Democratic landslides (71% in 2000, 60% in 2004, 70% in 2008, and now 69% in 2012 in cities of over 500,000) are a serious issue for the GOP in an era when the suburbs are an unreliable constituency. <paragraph>  A case in point is Pennsylvania, where Romney ran more competitively than John McCain in the Big Four suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia — and even won one of them by a razor-close margin — but was still swamped by Philadelphia, which delivered a Democratic margin in the neighborhood of 465,000 votes.  <paragraph>  The GOP practice of ignoring the cities made political sense for decades, when the suburbs and urban America were at odds. The GOP was unquestionably the party of the suburbs — it celebrated the suburban way of life in a way that Democrats did not because of their urban base — and the party presented itself as a bulwark against the crime and dysfunction of the Democratic central cities. But as the cities came under a new generation of leadership in the 1990s and the suburbs began to mature and diversify — not to mention share some of the same problems as the central cities — the GOP’s grip began to loosen.  <paragraph>  There were other important factors in play as well — Democrats began to compete more aggressively for the suburban vote and many suburbs dislodged themselves from the GOP as the party moved to a more socially conservative posture. <paragraph>  In 2004, it looked like the exurbs might be the answer to the GOP’s declining suburban strength. But the housing market crash and recession has put a brake on exurban growth and there are signs in key swing states like Virginia that Democrats can compete — or at least not get killed there.  <paragraph>  Back in 1952, GOP Sen. Robert Taft made the prescient, though not entirely correct, prediction that  <quotation>   <paragraph>  The same can’t be said of the GOP and its big city problem — big cities still only constitute 11 percent of the electorate, according to exit polls. But the combination of a fickle suburban vote and a Democratic urban hammerlock is a formula for defeat in many states, as Romney learned Tuesday.
11/7/12 4:05 PM EST | PPP nailed it |  <paragraph>  The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling, which took flak all year long from Republicans complaining about its partisan bias, had a very, very good Election Day.  <paragraph>  In every swing state, its final presidential polls were validated Tuesday night as PPP reported the correct winner in all 9 battlegrounds and in the 3 other states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania) that the Romney campaign feinted toward.  <paragraph>  In its final state polls before the election, PPP had President Obama ahead in every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reported a statistical tie with Romney at 49.4 and Obama at 49.2. And that’s very close to how it all played out.  <paragraph>  While more than a few firms picked the right winners, PPP also nailed the exact result — at the moment, at least — in Florida, 50-49. And in most cases it was never more than a point or two off each candidate’s performance.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  A Fordham University report released Wednesday ranked the firm first among 28 organizations for the accuracy of its final, national preelection estimates.  <paragraph>  The story in the Senate was much the same for PPP. It correctly picked every winner and, in most cases, slightly understated Democratic support and overstated GOP support.  <paragraph>  The uniformity of its final, pre-election surveys — for Obama, nearly up-and-down the line — left PPP  <hyperlink>  highly exposed in the event of a Romney victory.  <paragraph>  Now, however, the firm can always point to the 2012 scoreboard when confronted with the invariable criticism directed its way.
11/2/12 12:00 PM EDT | GOP ahead of 2008 early vote pace |  <paragraph>   Until Election Day, there’s no way to know for certain whether or not the GOP’s ground game is better this year than in 2008.  <paragraph>   But by one important yardstick – early voting – the GOP is showing notable improvement in key battleground states.  <paragraph>   According to data compiled by the   <hyperlink> United States Election Project and POLITICO, in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina, Republicans are running several points ahead of their 2008 pace, while Democrats are running several points behind, in percentage of early votes cast.  <paragraph>   Those five are the only swing states that have party registration or offer the statistical breakdowns that enable the comparison.  <paragraph>   In Colorado, Republicans have cast 38 percent of the early vote to 35 percent for Democrats and 27 percent for unaffiliated voters. Four years ago, the numbers were reversed: Democrats cast 38 percent, Republicans 36 percent and independents 26 percent.  <paragraph>   In Iowa, 43 percent of the early vote this year has been cast by Democrats, 32 percent by Republicans and 24 percent by no party or other. In 2008, the numbers were 47 (D) 29 (R) 24 (NP).  <paragraph>   While Nevada doesn’t provide comparative statewide early vote data between 2008 and 2012, a similar pattern emerges in the two counties where the bulk of the state vote will be cast – the Democratic percentage of early votes is down slightly and there’s an uptick in the GOP percentage.  <paragraph>   In both Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno), Democrats continue to outpace Republicans, but by a diminished margin over 2008.  <paragraph>   Back then, Democrats held a 52 percent to 31 percent early vote advantage in Clark County. This year, the margin is 48-33. In Washoe, it was 47-35 in 2008 and it’s 41-40 this year.  <paragraph>   It’s a mistake to draw too many conclusions from the swing state early vote numbers – early voting isn’t over yet and there are too many state-specific variables to make broad conclusions about what it all means.  <paragraph>   But, if nothing else, the early vote suggests that in the states where it matters most, GOP turnout efforts are better organized and operating at a higher level than four years ago. And that matters a great deal in an election that figures to be exceptionally close.
11/5/12 9:08 PM EST  | PPP: Obama leads everywhere |   <paragraph>   The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling has come in for a great deal of criticism this year, mainly from Republicans questioning its motives and methodology.  <paragraph>   The prolific pollster regularly produces quality work, but its Democratic affiliations and occasionally suspect practices [  <hyperlink> here and   <hyperlink> here] have led Republicans to dismiss its findings in the same manner that Democrats dismiss Rasmussen polls as biased toward the GOP.  <paragraph>   Now, almost on cue, PPP has delivered a final series of state polls that puts President Barack Obama in the lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reports a 49-49 tie.  <paragraph>   Against the backdrop of a highly competitive election, the uniformity of those results — and the fact that PPP shows 5- to 6-point spreads in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — puts the firm out on a ledge. So when the final state outcomes are known, PPP figures to be one of the election’s biggest winners or losers, poised either to spike the football — or to explain what went wrong.
10/30/12 3:45 PM EDT | Hurricane Sandy: The political fallout |       <paragraph>     <picture>  <paragraph>   The widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy is going to have an effect on Election Day. The only question is how far-reaching it’s going to be. While some states escaped with far less damage than they feared, as many as 8.5 million residents across the Northeast were without power Tuesday — and a portion of them faced the prospect of an extended period of time without electricity.    <paragraph>   Here are six things to watch in assessing the storm’s political fallout:    <paragraph>   The popular vote The storm’s path along the Eastern Seaboard ripped across a wide swath of blue state America. The list of hardest hit states includes many of the states expected to deliver the biggest victory margins for the president this year — among them New York, which delivered a 2 million vote winning margin to President Obama in 2008.    <paragraph>   While the extent to which elections will be disrupted next week is unclear, the extensive power outages, flooding and wreckage from North Carolina to Maine are certain to have an impact on campaign ground games and could work to depress voter turnout in some places.    <paragraph>   That shouldn’t affect the electoral vote — New York, for example, will still deliver its 29 electoral votes to Barack Obama regardless of the damage to lower Manhattan — but in an exceptionally tight election, lower turnout in the most Democratic states increases the odds of a scenario where Obama wins the Electoral College but loses the popular vote.    <paragraph>   The Senate map The storm’s path cut through a handful of states with some of this year’s closest Senate races — among them Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia.    <paragraph>   While the Connecticut and Virginia races are open seat contests, Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown and Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey are running for reelection. As their home states begin the process of recovery, both incumbents have unique opportunities for free media and to connect with constituents — in an official capacity — at a time when many will be in need of local and federal assistance.    <paragraph>   The House map New York, which has suffered the highest death toll and where 2.3 million households were without power Tuesday, is one the prime House battlegrounds this year. There are as many as eight competitive races, most of them located south of Albany, where the bulk of the power outages have occurred.    <paragraph>   In New Hampshire, where the state’s two Republican incumbents are in danger of losing their seats, the state remains under a flood watch. But the Union Leader reported that     <quotation>       <paragraph>   The 2016ers Any number of the nation’s governors (or mayors) can attest to the leadership challenges of natural disasters and the powerful effect they can have on approval ratings — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is among those who experienced a post-hurricane spike in popularity after Hurricane Irene.    <paragraph>   The path of Hurricane Sandy means it will test a handful of governors with prospects beyond their home states — Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.    <paragraph>   With the nation watching, how they respond will go a long way toward establishing their home state narrative. But it will also provide a first impression to many voters outside their states whose introduction to them comes solely through glimpses of interviews and press conferences on cable and broadcast news.    <paragraph>   Maine’s electoral vote Maine is one of two states (the other is Nebraska) that allocates its electoral votes by congressional district. While the statewide vote is firmly in the Obama camp, local Republicans believe one of its two congressional districts is within Mitt Romney’s reach — raising the possibility that the GOP nominee could capture one of the state’s four electoral votes.     <paragraph>   It’s a longshot, for sure. But it’s worth noting that the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future recently reserved a significant amount of airtime in Maine television markets. While much of that was in the Portland market — and thus designed to bleed into New Hampshire — the buy also covered the northern-based 2nd District, which is where the GOP sees its opportunity.     <paragraph>   As a whole, the state was largely spared the worst of the storm’s damage. But the aftereffects of the storm were not evenly distributed — at least 60,000 customers were without power Tuesday afternoon, the bulk of them in the Portland area, not in the expansive 2nd District. It could very well mean nothing. But anything that could alter the equation in Maine in the final week of the campaign is worth keeping an eye on.     <paragraph>   A leadership test for incumbents If we’ve learned anything about the politics of natural disasters, it’s that careers can be made and unmade in the preparations and aftermath.    <paragraph>   Snowstorms, hurricanes, flooding, wildfires — they offer rare, unfiltered opportunities for elected officials to prove their mettle under pressure, and at a time of great need.    <paragraph>   The experiences of the Bush family alone sketch out the range of political consequences.    <paragraph>   In August 1992, FEMA’s disjointed response to the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew took its toll on President George H.W. Bush’s standing in Florida, which he managed to carry narrowly that fall but by a dramatically reduced margin over 1988. After three consecutive blowout GOP presidential wins there, Bush scraped to victory by just 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 39 percent — a 20-point GOP drop since 1988.    <paragraph>   His son Jeb Bush, the former two-term Florida governor, learned from the experience. His own hurricane preparation and relief efforts — 8 major storms hit the state in 2004 and 2005 — helped burnish his own reputation as a chief executive and bolster his popularity.    <paragraph>   Jeb Bush’s brother, President George W. Bush, failed to hit the same high mark as president. While his own Florida hurricane response efforts in 2004 were well received, his presidency never recovered from the administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
10/23/12 2:15 PM EDT | Reid: A one-man Romney wrecking crew |  <paragraph>   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid returned to his highly stylized Mitt Romney-bashing Monday in Nevada.  <paragraph>   While Reid’s attacks on Romney have been an ongoing pursuit, the stinging, personal nature of the criticism continues to stand out. Much of it is specific to Romney’s character — among other things, Reid has questioned the GOP nominee’s faith and insinuated he’s a tax cheat. It’s a level of disparagement that reaches beyond standard partisan character attacks, marked by especially blunt rhetoric for a Senate majority leader.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    the Las Vegas Sun report:    <quotation>    <paragraph>   Reid and Romney’s shared Mormon faith makes the Nevada senator's scorched-earth approach all the more fascinating. At a time that’s being called "the Mormon moment" because of the historic nature of Romney’s candidacy — he’s the first Mormon major party nominee — and at a time when the former Massachusetts governor has overwhelming support among fellow members of the LDS Church, the nation’s other top Mormon in public life ranks as one of Romney’s harshest detractors.    <paragraph>   One byproduct of the strained relationship is that it expresses the spectrum of LDS political thinking to a nation that’s unfamiliar with it. But it also raises questions about     <hyperlink>    what kind of relationship the two could ever hope to have if Romney were to be elected president.
