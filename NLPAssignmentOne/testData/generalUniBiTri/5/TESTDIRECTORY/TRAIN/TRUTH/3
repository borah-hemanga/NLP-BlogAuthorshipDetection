10/15/12 10:13 PM EDT | Romney's Electoral College gains | <paragraph> Is Mitt Romney surging ahead of Barack Obama in the battleground states that will elect the next president? USA Today says "yes" and insiders in the Democratic Party are growing more concerned by the day that the President's built-in advantage in the Electoral College has all but disappeared. <paragraph> A new USA Today/Gallup poll has Romney leading President Obama by 4 percentage points among likely voters in 12 battleground states. The reason? USA Today says women in these swing states are moving Mitt's way. Time Magazine's Mark Halperin is also reporting tonight in an Electoral College update that a top Democratic source is worrying for the first time that Ohio may be slipping out of the Obama column and moving toward the tossup pile. <paragraph> Halperin explains: <quotation> <paragraph> Just yesterday, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll had President Obama surging ahead of Mitt Romney and breaking past the 50 percent mark, so who knows what the next poll brings. But one thing is certain, the tightening race does give us all one more reason to tune into Tuesday night's presidential debate.
