5/2/12 9:09 PM EDT | Newt Gingrich's real legacy |    <paragraph>  With Newt Gingrich's belated exit from the Republican presidential campaign, now is a good time to ask what impact his vertiginous race will have on his legacy.   <paragraph>  My guess? Not much.  <paragraph>  Sure, we learned that the former speaker is undisciplined on the campaign trail, has a tumultuous past and is often ideologically inconsistent. But that's not news to anyone who worked with Mr. Gingrich for more than a week while he served in Congress. And Newt Gingrich served in Congress for a very long time.  <paragraph>  Instead, 2012 is just one more reminder of how in politics, a politician's past is always prologue. For Newt's campaign staff, that proved to be bad news.  <paragraph>  (<hyperlink> PHOTOS: Newt Gingrich's career)  <paragraph>  But despite the withering critiques of many (including myself), give Mr. Gingrich his due. History will record him as one of the most significant Republican figures of the last 50 years. For a short while in the 1990s, Newt Gingrich bent history. <paragraph>  He led Republicans to a majority in the House for the first time in 40 years,  He led the fight to balance the budget for the first time in a generation, He helped balance that budget for four consecutive years for the first time since the 1920s, He rammed through welfare reform despite initial opposition from Bill Clinton and the Democrats, and He extended the life of Medicare when Democrats chose to demagogue the issue  <paragraph>  Of course, many will also blame the Gingrich speakership for the poisonous atmosphere that infects Washington today, but vicious personal attacks in American politics predated Newt's 1994 rise by about 220 years. And since many of the same people who judged Gingrich for his take-no-hostages approach remained silent when Ted Kennedy accused Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork of supporting segregation, back-alley abortions and midnight police raids, those critiques are not worth the paper on which they are written.  <paragraph>  Newt Gingrich may have turned negative campaigning into a dark art form, but he was not its inventor.  <paragraph>  Newt's more lasting legacy will be what he accomplished in 1995 and 1996. For those achievements, Speaker Gingrich will long be remembered as the man who brought the Reagan Revolution to the Legislative Branch. That legacy remains secure tonight despite the ending of a very sloppy campaign.
