5/1/12 9:26 PM EDT | Politics and the endless war |  <paragraph>  The president's prime-time address tonight put a bow on the political gift Osama bin Laden's death provided Team Obama.  <paragraph>  Did the White House politicize the terror chief's death? Of course. Is it breaking news that an administration would do such a thing? Of course not.  <paragraph>  In 1960, John Kennedy created a missile gap with the Soviets out of thin air to defeat Richard Nixon.  <paragraph>  Four years later, LBJ shamelessly used his "Daisy" ad to suggest that a Goldwater administration would cause a nuclear war.  <paragraph>  In 1968, Richard Nixon lied about a secret plan to get out of Vietnam.  <paragraph>  In 2002, Karl Rove and the GOP used September 11th as a wedge issue against Democratic candidates.  <paragraph>  And in 2012, President Obama is using the killing of Osama bin Laden as a political tool.  <paragraph>  If you are shocked by such things, get over it. Be more concerned  with the president's declaration that U.S. troops will be in Afghanistan until 2024. That reality means Americans who were not even born on Sept. 11, 2001, will be occupying Afghanistan 20 years after those attacks. Never mind that the epicenter of Al Qaeda's operation has moved to Yemen or that U.S. taxpayers are doling out $2 billion a week on a war whose main purpose is propping up one of the most corrupt regimes on the face of the Earth.  <paragraph>  Making matters worse is the fact that Mr. Obama's opponents in the GOP want to stay longer. <paragraph>  The takeaway of President Obama's speech tonight is simple. The neocons won, the troops lost and the endless war grinds on in a land that humbled the Soviet Union, the British Empire and Alexander the Great. Good luck with that, Mr. President.
