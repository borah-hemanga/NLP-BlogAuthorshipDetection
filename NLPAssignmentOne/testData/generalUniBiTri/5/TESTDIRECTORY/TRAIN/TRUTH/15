4/30/12 9:03 PM EDT | Hoover, Carter and cheap shots |  <paragraph>   <quotation>  wrote Finley Peter Dunne in an 1895 newspaper column explaining how Washington is not for the weak-hearted. And Mr. Dunne was right.  <paragraph>  All those hoping to find charity, love and justice on the campaign trail would do best to seek out the nearest church pew to rest their weary bones. That is because young politicians are taught daily just how rough the sport can be.  <paragraph>  In Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy's new book The President's Club, we see time and again how ex-presidents have been swept aside with brutish efficiency by the incoming president - whether it was Dwight Eisenhower coldly dispatching his former boss Harry Truman or John Kennedy dismissing Ike eight years later because he believed wrongly that the old general was hopelessly out of touch.   <paragraph>  But one of the most glaring examples of a president throwing a high, inside fastball on one of his predecessors was after Harry Truman had used Herbert Hoover from 1945 through 1948 to save millions of Europeans from starving after World War II. Truman also tapped Hoover to reorganize the federal government in a way that dramatically impacts even Barack Obama today. The alliance between Truman and Hoover was historic and, before long, the formerly disgraced GOP president became one of the most-admired men in America.   <paragraph>  Then came the 1948 election.  <paragraph>  Although Hoover gave the president his word that he would remain positive throughout the election, Gibbs and Duffy tell us that Harry Truman unloaded on the man who helped him save Europe from starvation and Soviet influence. On the campaign trail he would blame Hoover and the Republicans for causing the Great Depression while privately he would say, <quotation>    <paragraph>  But for Truman, politics was a tough game played by tough men, so he didn't give his strategy a second thought. And although Herbert Hoover was hurt by his friend's attacks, he swallowed his pride and continued his efforts reorganizing the executive branch for Truman and his successors.  <paragraph>  Given the long history of former presidents being used as political punching bags, I suppose I should not be surprised that these kind of attacks continue today. But I do wish ex-presidents would show the dignity and grace of George H.W. Bush in respecting the office of the presidency so much that they would choose to refrain from besmirching a member of the President's Club.  <paragraph>  I know this sounds old-fashioned and a bit out of touch with the realities of the 24/7 culture but I still revere the presidency even if I have been less than thrilled with the performance of some of its recent occupants.  <paragraph>  Which leads to a story that POLITICO is covering today regarding a man who hopes to become a member of the President's Club next January. Today, we heard Mitt Romney take a shot at the 39th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter. In responding to a reporter's question as to whether Romney would have ordered an attack on Osama bin Laden, the Republican front-runner said that  <quotation>     <paragraph>  That a GOP candidate would use Carter as a political target is not a surprise. We Republicans - and I include myself here - have been using President Carter as a political target for as long as Democrats lashed out at Hoover. But considering that Carter did the unthinkable by 2012 standards last week and praised Mitt Romney, I found his cheap shot at President Carter to be a bit jarring.  <paragraph>  Also, I wonder if there should be a statute of limitations on the political attacks the 39th president has to absorb. As a conservative who has been criticizing the former president for almost four decades now, I say enough is enough. All one has to do is read a few pages of Jimmy Carter's White House Diary or his recent Bible guide to get a better understanding of the challenges that constantly faced the man from Plains when he lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  <paragraph>  His were the same kind of monumental crises that Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton stared down daily. And while I will be the first to say that the people and the press have every right to challenge a sitting president every step of the way, I would suggest that after a president has been out of the Oval Office for 30 years, politicians should look elsewhere for cheap shots.
