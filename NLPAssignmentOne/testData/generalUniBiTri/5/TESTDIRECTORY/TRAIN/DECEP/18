11/4/12 1:00 PM EST | Jerry Brown's last stand |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   When it comes to   <hyperlink> Proposition 30, the bold tax initiative pushed by California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, the stakes are high — and not just because of the policy implications.  <paragraph>   Dan Walters, a widely respected Sacramento Bee columnist,  <hyperlink> writes that the 74-year-old governor’s legacy hangs in the balance:   <quotation>  <paragraph>   The polls report that the outcome is very much up in the air, with support just shy of 50 percent, leading Walters to ask, in the event of a loss,   <quotation>  <paragraph>   There would be no shortage of Democratic talent if Brown declined to run again — Lt.
