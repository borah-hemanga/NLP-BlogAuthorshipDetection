11/4/12 12:08 PM EST | How Pennsylvania will be won |   <paragraph>   Maybe Pennsylvania is a GOP mirage, maybe it’s not.  <paragraph>   But if Mitt Romney is going to win the state, the victory will be powered by his performance in the Philadelphia suburbs, which is why he’ll appear at a suburban Bucks County event Sunday.  <paragraph>   For decades, the big four suburban counties -- Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery – were the engine of GOP statewide victories. But all of them began to drift out of the GOP orbit in the 1990s and they’ve been a big reason why a Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won the state since 1988.  <paragraph>   Without them, it’s nearly impossible for Republicans to counterbalance the big Democratic margins coming out of the city of Philadelphia.  <paragraph>   In 2008, when the suburbs cast 22 percent of the statewide vote, Obama won 57 percent in the four counties. For much of this year, he seemed poised to win them again: A late September Franklin & Marshall College poll had Obama leading 54-36 in the four counties, a lead that he had held for months.  <paragraph>   When Franklin & Marshall polled the state again in late October, however Romney had pulled ahead, 47-45. Whether or not Obama truly cratered in the Philly burbs as the F&M poll suggested, other polls – Susquehanna, internal polling for House candidates – also found that Romney was closing in the collar counties.  <paragraph>   Still, a narrow win in the suburbs of southeastern Pennsylvania probably won’t be enough to put Romney over the top.  <paragraph>   There's every sign he'll perform well in western Pennsylvania outside of Pittsburgh, but he’ll also need to run up the score in the section known as the Republican “T” -- the central part of the state and its northern tier of counties. And Romney will need to be far more competitive than John McCain was in the Lehigh Valley.  <paragraph>   Pennsylvania is an uphill climb for the GOP ticket, but it’s possible. Not without a foothold in the Philadelphia suburbs, though.
