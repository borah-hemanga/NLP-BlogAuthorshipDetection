10/19/12 11:08 AM EDT | Gay marriage polling uncertain | <paragraph>   A new poll in Washington state shows a comfortable lead for R-74, a referendum that would approve same-sex marriage.    <paragraph>   Fifty-four percent of voters support the ballot measure, according to a     <hyperlink>    KCTS 9 Washington Poll released Thursday, compared with 38 percent who oppose it.    <paragraph>   Washington is one of four Democratic-oriented states that will be voting on same-sex marriage measures on Election Day — Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota are the others — and in each of them, polling suggests that November could provide a breakthrough victory on an issue that has never passed on a statewide ballot.    <paragraph>   In Maryland, for example,    <hyperlink>    a Washington Post poll released Thursday reported voters favor upholding the state’s gay marriage law, 52 percent to 43 percent.    <paragraph>   There’s just one problem. In the past, polling surrounding same-sex marriage measures has been highly unreliable — voters have not always been truthful with pollsters about their true voting preference.    <paragraph>   As a result, the University of Washington, which conducted the KCTS 9 poll, also offered adjusted data to account for     <quotation>   — the tendency of voters to misrepresent their true feelings on sensitive issues in an attempt to present themselves in a way that will seem favorable to others.    <paragraph>   With the adjusted vote estimate, the results were a lot closer — 53 percent in support of the measure and 47 percent in opposition.    <paragraph>   That’s a 9-point swing in opposition, a dramatically higher percentage than in the unadjusted results and one that should worry marriage equality advocates since the polling spread in Maine, Maryland and Minnesota is under 10 points.
