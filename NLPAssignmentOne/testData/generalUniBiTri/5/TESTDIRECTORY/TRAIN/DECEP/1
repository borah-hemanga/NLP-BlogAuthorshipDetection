11/20/12 9:17 AM EST | The power of Calif.'s ethnic vote|   <paragraph>  Mitt Romney lost California by a landslide this year, but exit polls revealed he made big gains with one important demographic: white voters. In 2008, white Californians voted 52 to 46 percent for President Obama. In 2012, they flipped and voted 53-45 for Romney.  <paragraph>  In the end, though, it made almost no difference. Romney improved over John McCain’s weak 2008 performance by just 1 percentage point.  <paragraph>  Mark DiCamillo, director of California’s Field Poll,  <hyperlink>  explains the tectonic forces that made Romney’s gains largely irrelevant:  <quotation>  <paragraph>  This year’s exit polls suggest a dramatic change in the composition of the California electorate in just the past four years: The white share of the vote was 63 percent in 2008, then dropped to 55 percent in 2012.  <paragraph>  Demographic change isn’t the only story here. DiCamillo concludes that the best explanation for the growth in Latino, Asian-American and African-American support for Democratic candidates relates to their view of the role of government.  <paragraph>  While California's white non-Hispanics are evenly divided on whether the government should do more to solve the nation's problems, ethnic voters believe that government should be doing more by nearly 2 to 1.
