11/13/12 7:10 PM EST  | Scott Brown's comeback tour |  <picture>  <paragraph>  He might have lost his Senate seat last week, but Scott Brown is still very much in the game.  <paragraph>  Between the 2014 Massachusetts governor’s race and the swirling rumors regarding a possible Cabinet position for Sen. John Kerry, several promising   <hyperlink>  opportunities might soon present themselves to Brown.  <paragraph>  In a media availability Tuesday in Washington, the senator dodged questions about his future.  <paragraph>   <quotation>  <hyperlink>  Brown said. <quotation>    <paragraph>  Given his track record — a giant special election upset and a respectable loss in his bid to win a full term — and the Massachusetts GOP’s thin bench, Brown has far more leverage than the typical election loser in choosing an avenue of return.  <paragraph>  If he’s interested in returning to the Senate, however, Brown is looking at a daunting scenario. If Kerry steps down, Brown would have to run next year in a 2013 Senate special election, followed by the regularly scheduled 2014 election for the full six-year term. That would make four grueling statewide campaigns in five years in a heavily Democratic state — the 2010 special, the 2012 general election against Elizabeth Warren, a 2013 special and a 2014 general.
