11/7/12 4:05 PM EST | PPP nailed it |  <paragraph>  The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling, which took flak all year long from Republicans complaining about its partisan bias, had a very, very good Election Day.  <paragraph>  In every swing state, its final presidential polls were validated Tuesday night as PPP reported the correct winner in all 9 battlegrounds and in the 3 other states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania) that the Romney campaign feinted toward.  <paragraph>  In its final state polls before the election, PPP had President Obama ahead in every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reported a statistical tie with Romney at 49.4 and Obama at 49.2. And that’s very close to how it all played out.  <paragraph>  While more than a few firms picked the right winners, PPP also nailed the exact result — at the moment, at least — in Florida, 50-49. And in most cases it was never more than a point or two off each candidate’s performance.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  A Fordham University report released Wednesday ranked the firm first among 28 organizations for the accuracy of its final, national preelection estimates.  <paragraph>  The story in the Senate was much the same for PPP. It correctly picked every winner and, in most cases, slightly understated Democratic support and overstated GOP support.  <paragraph>  The uniformity of its final, pre-election surveys — for Obama, nearly up-and-down the line — left PPP  <hyperlink>  highly exposed in the event of a Romney victory.  <paragraph>  Now, however, the firm can always point to the 2012 scoreboard when confronted with the invariable criticism directed its way.
