11/9/12 6:30 AM EST  | The GOP's big city problem | <picture> <paragraph>  There’s at least one ray of hope for the GOP in Mitt Romney’s loss Tuesday: Exit polls show he won back the suburbs from President Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Romney won the suburbs 50 percent to 48 percent, recapturing them after Obama won the crabgrass frontier by the same margin in 2008.  <paragraph>  It’s an important symbolic win for the GOP since, with few exceptions, the suburbs have been the province of the Republican Party in post-war presidential elections.  <paragraph>  But Romney’s victory margin in the suburbs wasn’t by nearly enough, and it underscores a problem confronting the GOP. While the suburbs powered the GOP for decades, they also created a false sense of security — and a political dependency — that threatens the party’s future in an era of when most of the older suburbs are firmly in the Democratic column and many of the newer ones are up for grabs.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  Sommer Mathis of the Atlantic Cities website puts it succinctly:  <quotation>    <paragraph>  Even if you don’t buy the recent analysis that cities are growing faster than the suburbs, the big city Democratic landslides (71% in 2000, 60% in 2004, 70% in 2008, and now 69% in 2012 in cities of over 500,000) are a serious issue for the GOP in an era when the suburbs are an unreliable constituency. <paragraph>  A case in point is Pennsylvania, where Romney ran more competitively than John McCain in the Big Four suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia — and even won one of them by a razor-close margin — but was still swamped by Philadelphia, which delivered a Democratic margin in the neighborhood of 465,000 votes.  <paragraph>  The GOP practice of ignoring the cities made political sense for decades, when the suburbs and urban America were at odds. The GOP was unquestionably the party of the suburbs — it celebrated the suburban way of life in a way that Democrats did not because of their urban base — and the party presented itself as a bulwark against the crime and dysfunction of the Democratic central cities. But as the cities came under a new generation of leadership in the 1990s and the suburbs began to mature and diversify — not to mention share some of the same problems as the central cities — the GOP’s grip began to loosen.  <paragraph>  There were other important factors in play as well — Democrats began to compete more aggressively for the suburban vote and many suburbs dislodged themselves from the GOP as the party moved to a more socially conservative posture. <paragraph>  In 2004, it looked like the exurbs might be the answer to the GOP’s declining suburban strength. But the housing market crash and recession has put a brake on exurban growth and there are signs in key swing states like Virginia that Democrats can compete — or at least not get killed there.  <paragraph>  Back in 1952, GOP Sen. Robert Taft made the prescient, though not entirely correct, prediction that  <quotation>   <paragraph>  The same can’t be said of the GOP and its big city problem — big cities still only constitute 11 percent of the electorate, according to exit polls. But the combination of a fickle suburban vote and a Democratic urban hammerlock is a formula for defeat in many states, as Romney learned Tuesday.
