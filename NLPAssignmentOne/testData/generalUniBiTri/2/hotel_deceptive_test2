11/19/12 12:13 PM EST  | Obama's big county blowouts | <picture> Courtesy of Larry J. Sabato's Crystal Ball  <paragraph>  Here’s a stat that provides a measure of how thoroughly the GOP presidential ticket got thrashed in the “urban areas” Paul Ryan referred to: Mitt Romney lost 44 of the nation’s top 50 most populous counties on Election Day, a significant fall off from George W. Bush’s 2000 performance in those places.  <paragraph>  According to an analysis by Larry Sabato’s   <hyperlink>  Crystal Ball website, Bush won 16 big counties in his first bid, compared to just 6 for Romney. The majority of those counties weren’t close in 2012 — President Barack Obama won more than 55 percent of the vote in 34 of them.  <paragraph>  Many of the top 50 counties include big cities and have majority minority populations, so the results sketch out the full contours of the GOP’s weakness in urban America and among minority voters.  <paragraph>  The Crystal Ball research suggests the problem is getting worse in many places, not better. Consider Los Angeles County, the nation’s single largest county. In 1988, Michael Dukakis won 52-47 there. By 2000, the margin was 64-32 for Al Gore. This year, Obama won 69-29.  <paragraph>  Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County is a similar story: 59-40 Dukakis in 1988, 63-33 Gore in 2000 and 69-30 Obama in 2012.  <paragraph>  Even the big counties that once favored the GOP are drifting out of the party’s orbit as they diversify.  <paragraph>  In 1988, Charlotte’s Mecklenburg County gave George H.W. Bush 59 percent of the vote. By 2000, the GOP advantage in North Carolina’s most populous county was down to 51-48. This year, Barack Obama won 61-38.  <paragraph>  Then there’s Orange County, Calif. — the onetime conservative stronghold that Ronald Reagan called the place  <quotation>    <paragraph>  GOP presidential performance there declined from 68 percent in 1988 to 53 percent in 2012. The good news for Republicans? That 53 percent represents an uptick from John McCain’s 50 percent in 2008.
11/12/12 2:53 PM EST | A GOP call for reform in Minnesota | <paragraph>  A critical part of the GOP’s path forward is a reexamining of process — in other words, looking closely at the institutional factors that are generating unelectable nominees.  <paragraph>  In Minnesota, where first-term Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar won a landslide victory over largely unknown Republican state Rep. Kurt Bills, former state GOP Executive Director Ben Golnik   <hyperlink>  calls for an end to the complicated candidate-endorsement process that helped deliver the nomination to Bills.  <paragraph>   <quotation>    <paragraph>  Calls to reform the nominating process in states like Minnesota aren’t new, but it’s possible they’ll take on an increased urgency in the wake of two successive national election cycles marked by unusually weak Republican general election candidates.  <paragraph>  The problem, of course, is that pure primary elections aren’t a cure-all. Primaries have produced the most notorious GOP nominees of the past two cycles — the ones who essentially handed over seats to Democratic candidates.
11/8/12 10:06 AM EST | What color is Pennsylvania? | <paragraph>  With President Barack Obama’s victory Tuesday, Pennsylvania has voted Democratic for president in six consecutive elections. It’s become something of a presidential year mirage for Republicans, always within sight, but never in the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  It’s not that Pennsylvania is unwinnable for the GOP: As Marcel Groen, Democratic chairman of suburban behemoth Montgomery County, reminds the   <hyperlink>  Philadelphia Inquirer, <quotation>    <paragraph>  It’s also true that Obama’s 2008 statewide margin was cut in half and that Mitt Romney was competitive in three of the big four suburban counties that ring Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Still, in the wake of Tuesday’s results, it seems highly unlikely that Pennsylvania will emerge as a key battleground state in 2016 – and even a blowout GOP win in the 2014 midterm election is unlikely to change that. After all, that’s exactly what happened in Pennsylvania in 2010, and it proved to be a harbinger of nothing.
11/3/12 4:14 PM EDT | N.J. grapples with Sandy confusion | <paragraph>  <picture>  <paragraph> The Star Ledger  <hyperlink> reports Saturday that there’s widespread confusion across New Jersey <quotation>  <paragraph> Conventional wisdom has held that, since New Jersey is a strongly Democratic state and Democratic strongholds in north Jersey took a beating from Hurricane Sandy, President Obama’s popular vote totals stands to be diminished by the prospect of decreased turnout.  <paragraph>   While that may be true, it’s often overlooked that the GOP vote could be significantly affected – the superstorm devastated some of the few Republican strongholds in the state, from Cape May north to Monmouth County. Ocean County, which delivered a 50,000-vote GOP margin in 2008, was especially hard hit.  <paragraph>   In any case, there's little evidence to suggest that the ultimate outcome is going be affected -- the state's 14 electoral votes appear firmly ensconced in the Democratic column.  <paragraph>   (h/t Ginger Gibson)
11/4/12 12:08 PM EST | How Pennsylvania will be won |   <paragraph>   Maybe Pennsylvania is a GOP mirage, maybe it’s not.  <paragraph>   But if Mitt Romney is going to win the state, the victory will be powered by his performance in the Philadelphia suburbs, which is why he’ll appear at a suburban Bucks County event Sunday.  <paragraph>   For decades, the big four suburban counties -- Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery – were the engine of GOP statewide victories. But all of them began to drift out of the GOP orbit in the 1990s and they’ve been a big reason why a Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won the state since 1988.  <paragraph>   Without them, it’s nearly impossible for Republicans to counterbalance the big Democratic margins coming out of the city of Philadelphia.  <paragraph>   In 2008, when the suburbs cast 22 percent of the statewide vote, Obama won 57 percent in the four counties. For much of this year, he seemed poised to win them again: A late September Franklin & Marshall College poll had Obama leading 54-36 in the four counties, a lead that he had held for months.  <paragraph>   When Franklin & Marshall polled the state again in late October, however Romney had pulled ahead, 47-45. Whether or not Obama truly cratered in the Philly burbs as the F&M poll suggested, other polls – Susquehanna, internal polling for House candidates – also found that Romney was closing in the collar counties.  <paragraph>   Still, a narrow win in the suburbs of southeastern Pennsylvania probably won’t be enough to put Romney over the top.  <paragraph>   There's every sign he'll perform well in western Pennsylvania outside of Pittsburgh, but he’ll also need to run up the score in the section known as the Republican “T” -- the central part of the state and its northern tier of counties. And Romney will need to be far more competitive than John McCain was in the Lehigh Valley.  <paragraph>   Pennsylvania is an uphill climb for the GOP ticket, but it’s possible. Not without a foothold in the Philadelphia suburbs, though.
11/21/12 11:51 AM EST | Allen West's cautionary tale |  <paragraph>   If you’re wondering how a member of Congress could raise more than $17 million for his reelection bid and still lose, read Alex Isenstadt’s     <hyperlink>    excellent post-mortem on GOP Rep. Allen West’s defeat.    <paragraph>   Alex reports that West had sky-high name ID, a Republican-leaning district, an inexperienced 29-year-old Democratic foe and an election eve lead in his internal polling but still fell short in the end.    <paragraph>   It’s a cautionary tale, not for the average House member but for political provocateurs like West. In his case, he learned the hard way that the iron laws of politics apply even to congressmen with a national base of support.    <paragraph>   His outspoken and over-the-top style, it seems, was out of sync with the locals in his highly competitive district — and he didn’t dial it down in the face of a tough reelection race. Top of the ticket performance was also a problem since President Obama goosed Democratic turnout in his south Florida seat.    <paragraph>   West’s Republican colleagues in Tallahassee didn’t exactly have his back, either. As a relative newcomer to politics, and with his eye fixed on Washington, West lacked relationships in the GOP-controlled state capital that might have resulted in a safer district from redistricting.    <paragraph>   It’s unlikely that we’ve heard the last of West, however. As Alex notes, cable news will still find him an attractive guest. And with his national following and proven fundraising talent — he raised at least $23 million in his two congressional races, a stunning amount for a House candidate — he would be a competitive candidate for any office he sought.    <paragraph>   There’s even a comeback model for lightning-rod pols like West.    <paragraph>   Just a few hours up the road, Democrat Alan Grayson returned to Congress this year after suffering a fate similar to West in 2010. Like West, Grayson’s brand of combative and outspoken liberalism was a mismatch for his more temperate Orlando district.    <paragraph>   But with his prolific fundraising and base of support he was able to jump on his first opportunity to return to Congress, when a new, heavily Democratic seat opened after redistricting. No one bothered to challenge him in the Democratic primary and Grayson won in a November cakewalk.
10/27/12 12:27 PM EDT | Fla. insiders: Romney will win state  |    <paragraph>   Florida’s top politicos believe by an overwhelming margin that Mitt Romney will carry the state on Election Day.    <paragraph>   According to the latest     <hyperlink>    Tampa Bay Times survey of 120 of Florida’s top political insiders, 73 percent expect Romney will win Florida, compared to just 27 percent who think President Barack Obama will win the state a second time.    <paragraph>   The list of 120 insiders – consultants, lobbyists, fundraisers, political scientists, etc. -- is a little top heavy with Republicans: it’s made up of 65 Republicans, 48 Democrats and 7 independents or minor party types.    <paragraph>   But even among Democrats, 60 percent think Romney will carry Florida. Republicans are more certain: 95 percent believe Romney will win the state’s 29 electoral votes.    <paragraph>   While much of the October polling validates the notion that Romney has the edge in the nation’s largest swing state, all signs point to a very tight finish. At the moment, the RealClearPolitics polling average spread between the candidates is 1.8 percentage points.
10/18/12 10:56 AM EDT | Rendell: Casey hasn't run a campaign |   <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   As Democrats nervously eye the narrowing polls in Pennsylvania’s Senate race, reliably off-message former Gov. Ed Rendell offers a frank assessment of why Republican Tom Smith has closed the gap with Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr.    <paragraph>   From the     <hyperlink>    Times-Tribune in Scranton:    <quotation>       <paragraph>   The race, which hasn’t been viewed as a top-tier contest, has undoubtedly gotten closer in the homestretch as Smith has poured millions into TV spots hammering the first-term incumbent. While Casey has led in every public poll taken this year — and at least two recent polls give him a double-digit edge — a handful of other surveys over the past two weeks put his advantage at 4 points or less.    <paragraph>   The Casey camp surely won’t appreciate Rendell’s analysis — delivered to the senator’s hometown paper — but it’s not surprising, given the long history the two pols share.    <paragraph>   Casey’s father defeated Rendell in the 1986 Democratic primary for governor; in 2002, Rendell returned to defeat the junior Casey in a bitter Democratic gubernatorial primary.    <paragraph>   By 2006, the two Democrats had established a working relationship: Rendell backed Casey in the 2006 Senate race. But two years later, they were on opposite sides again as Casey backed Barack Obama in the presidential primary and Rendell emerged as one of Hillary Clinton’s strongest supporters. <paragraph>   UPDATE: It's worth noting that, despite the criticism, Rendell still thinks Casey will win — and run ahead of the president.    <quotation>    it's almost impossible for Smith to win.    <quotation>   Rendell said in the same interview.    <quotation>
