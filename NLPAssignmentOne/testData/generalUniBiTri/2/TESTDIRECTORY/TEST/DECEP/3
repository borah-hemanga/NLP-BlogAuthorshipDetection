11/8/12 10:06 AM EST | What color is Pennsylvania? | <paragraph>  With President Barack Obama’s victory Tuesday, Pennsylvania has voted Democratic for president in six consecutive elections. It’s become something of a presidential year mirage for Republicans, always within sight, but never in the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  It’s not that Pennsylvania is unwinnable for the GOP: As Marcel Groen, Democratic chairman of suburban behemoth Montgomery County, reminds the   <hyperlink>  Philadelphia Inquirer, <quotation>    <paragraph>  It’s also true that Obama’s 2008 statewide margin was cut in half and that Mitt Romney was competitive in three of the big four suburban counties that ring Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Still, in the wake of Tuesday’s results, it seems highly unlikely that Pennsylvania will emerge as a key battleground state in 2016 – and even a blowout GOP win in the 2014 midterm election is unlikely to change that. After all, that’s exactly what happened in Pennsylvania in 2010, and it proved to be a harbinger of nothing.
