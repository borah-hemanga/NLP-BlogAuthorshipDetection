5/28/12 10:12 AM EDT  | An enduring sacrifice few can understand |   <paragraph> I remember moving past the generals and politicians to greet grief-stricken family members who lost a loved one at Khobar Towers. The 1996 terrorist attack killed 19 U.S. servicemen stationed in Saudi Arabia and several of those killed in the attack were stationed at Eglin Air Force Base in the heart of my congressional district.  <paragraph>  I quietly shook hands with the parents who lost their sons, the wives who lost their husbands and the sisters who lost their brothers. And as is usually the case when military tragedies curse families, one can do little more in their presence than pray for the fallen and offer assistance for those family members left behind.  <paragraph>  I slowly made my way down the receiving line until I was stopped by the sight of a young boy who was staring ahead vacantly across the room, past the generals and politicians who were walking by to pay their last respects to his dad. My eyes began to well up at his sight and I moved quickly to hug the boy. All I could whisper was that I was so sorry for his loss. I moved away just as quickly to hide my eyes from him and go outside for the ceremony.  <paragraph>  The fact that the boy was the same age as my oldest son in 1996 is why I still remember that jarring encounter on this Memorial Day 16 years later. This morning I recall all I shared with my sons over those 16 years: the Little League games I got to coach, the birthday parties I got to attend, the Christmas Eve candlelight services I enjoyed with my family, the prom pictures I forced Joey and Andrew to endure while their dates smiled and they just stood there squirming in their misfitting tuxes.  <paragraph>  All these years later, I still pray to God every night that I will be around to see them graduate, get married, have children and move safely into middle age -- all the things this young boy would endure without his dad. I also pray that children of the fallen have loved ones to pick up the pieces and move them forward toward a fulfilled life, but I know that is not always the case.  <paragraph>  When we talk about the American heroes who give their all for their country, I wonder how many people realize that their sacrifice continues being paid every day. Then I wonder why Washington refuses to treat those heroes who come home with the respect they deserve.  <paragraph>  On this Memorial Day, let us hope that one day soon they will. May God bless our fallen heroes and their family members today and far into the future.
