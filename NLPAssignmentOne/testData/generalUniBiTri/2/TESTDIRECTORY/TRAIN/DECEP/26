10/28/12 7:51 PM EDT | Register endorsement arrives late |  <paragraph>   As one of the great papers in presidential politics — and one of     <hyperlink>    four major Iowa newspapers to endorse Mitt Romney on Sunday — it's understandable that the Des Moines Register's endorsement would cause a     <hyperlink>    stir this weekend.   <paragraph>   But the impact of the paper’s decision, in terms of persuading voters, is likely limited. <paragraph>   It's not that the Register's endorsement doesn't matter. Rather, roughly a quarter of the state’s vote has already been cast.    <paragraph>   According to figures     <hyperlink>    released Friday by the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, 423,586 absentee votes have already been received. That represents 27 percent of the total votes cast in 2008.   <paragraph>   The late-in-the-campaign endorsements in Iowa and elsewhere suggest that many newspapers haven’t yet accounted for the dramatic growth in the percentage of early voting across the nation. In some states, for example, more than one-third of the vote has already been cast.  <paragraph>   The United States Election Project     <hyperlink>    estimates that, through Sunday, 13.8 million ballots have been cast in all reporting jurisdiction — roughly 10 percent of the total votes cast in the 2008 presidential election.
