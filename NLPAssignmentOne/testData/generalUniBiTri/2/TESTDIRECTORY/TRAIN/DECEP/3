11/19/12 7:37 PM EST  | The war on Charlie Crist |   <paragraph>   <picture>  <paragraph>  As former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist looks more and more like a Democratic prospect for governor in 2014, the Florida GOP is ramping up its efforts to damage his political brand:  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  Tthe Associated Press:  <quotation>    <paragraph>  It’s hard to overstate the level of disdain many Florida Republicans have for Crist, so in one sense, the Crist-bashing isn’t a surprise.  <paragraph>  But there’s some risk in an over-the-top approach — the more the GOP attacks Crist, who hasn’t even registered as a Democrat yet, the more he could look like a sympathetic character to his prospective party.  <paragraph>  The track record for recent high-profile party-switchers isn’t great: Former Alabama Rep. Parker Griffith lost by a wide margin in a 2010 GOP primary following his switch from the Democratic Party, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was also rejected by his new party in a 2010 Democratic primary after he switched from the GOP side.  <paragraph>  There’s one big difference, though, between those party-switchers and Crist. Griffith and Specter both ran for reelection in the same election cycle that they switched parties, leaving them little time or opportunity to establish a trusting relationship with their new parties.  <paragraph>  Crist, on the other hand, will have plenty of distance from the Republican Party by 2014, and lots of time to do the necessary spadework with the Democratic grass-roots. By then, four years will have passed since he left the GOP. He’s already begun the process of generating political goodwill by supporting Democratic candidates and emerging as a prominent backer of President Obama — and by attracting the ire of the Florida GOP.
