10/30/12 7:22 PM EDT | Richard Mourdock, party buzzkill |         <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   In what’s shaping up to a good Republican year in Indiana — Mitt Romney is likely to carry the state, Mike Pence is likely to win the governorship and both legislative chambers figure to remain in GOP control — GOP Senate nominee Richard Mourdock’s candidacy has turned out to be a discordant note.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    The Evansville Courier & Press reports on a marked difference in the reactions to the top of the ticket nominees at the Indiana GOP fall dinner Monday.  <paragraph>       <quotation>       <paragraph>   Fortunately for Mourdock, top Indiana Republicans haven’t abandoned his candidacy — in part because of what they see as the over-the-top ferocity of the ensuing Democratic attacks against him.    <paragraph>   If he manages to pull out a victory, he’ll still have some serious fence-mending to do if he hopes to be effective in the Senate. Even if Mourdock had never made his comments about pregnancies caused by rape, it would have taken some time for him to win over Republicans who still nurse grievances left from his primary victory over veteran Sen. Dick Lugar. On top of that, he would arrive in Washington far more politically radioactive than the typical freshman senator.
