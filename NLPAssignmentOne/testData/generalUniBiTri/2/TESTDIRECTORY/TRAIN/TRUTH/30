4/7/12 8:21 PM EDT | Subtlety at the Times this holy week |    <paragraph>       <picture>   <paragraph>   You have to give the New York Times editors credit. With 2 billion Christians worldwide to choose from, they found a small group of pilgrims in Spain looking like exaggerated versions of Ku Klux Klan members to place on their front page on this Holy Weekend. It would be hard to imagine the Times editors finding  a group of worshipping Christians that would appear more ghoulish to Times readers than the image chosen.    <paragraph>   Very subtle.
