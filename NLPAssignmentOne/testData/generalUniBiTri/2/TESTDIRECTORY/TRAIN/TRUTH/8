5/27/12 4:14 PM EDT | Time again for Obama to lead from behind |   <paragraph>  Today, Sunday morning newspapers around the world screamed with headlines announcing yet another tragedy out of Syria. Journalists inside the war-torn country report that forces aligned with Bashar al-Assad massacred at least 90 Syrians with indiscriminate mortar attacks on civilian targets; more than 30 children were among the dead.  <paragraph>  The massacre in Houla is another example of how deadly Kofi Annan's Syrian cease-fire has been for civilians who still believe the international community will actually do something to prevent further slaughter. After yesterday's attacks, Syrians have reason to become increasingly bitter at the United States for sitting back over the past year and doing very little while Assad murdered 10,000 of his own citizens.    <paragraph>  Imagine how difficult it must be for the mother of a Syrian child killed by Assad's bloodied hands to grasp the geopolitical complexities that compelled the United States to launch air attacks against Muammar Gadhafi's Libya (in the name of protecting civilians) while the same superpower has sat idly by while its enemy indiscriminately kills his fellow countrymen. The reality is that the Administration's Libya and Syria policies cannot be squared in a way that makes sense to even the most gifted foreign-policy analyst.   <paragraph>  It would be depressing to believe that the greatest sin 10,000 dead Syrians had on their heads before being killed was to have the bad luck of not being born in an oil-rich country like Libya. And yet I am not cynical enough to believe that such crude calculations enter the minds of American presidents.   <paragraph>  But with every unanswered massacre that Assad launches, Americans and members of the international community can be forgiven for possessing a healthy dose of skepticism.  <paragraph>  That's why it is time once again for Barack Obama to lead from behind. His patience toward Libya last year angered neoconservative hawks who would've preferred the president launch attacks first and ask questions later. But he wisely chose instead to give the Arab League and our European allies enough time and space to take the lead against Gadhafi's ruthless regime. It was then left, of course, to American men and women in uniform to help drive the Libyan dictator from power. They did just that, and the president was rightly praised for his shrewd handling of the crisis.   <paragraph>  The growing crisis in Syria calls for a similar approach. Fortunately, the president has already declared that Mr. Assad must go. His administration has also wisely continued to ramp up pressure on Russia.   <paragraph>  But the president must do more, by focusing intense pressure on allies and unbearable pressure on enemies to drive Bashar al-Assad from power. That outcome is not only a moral imperative. It is also in the United States long-term strategic interest.  <paragraph>  That is why it is time for a repeat performance from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
