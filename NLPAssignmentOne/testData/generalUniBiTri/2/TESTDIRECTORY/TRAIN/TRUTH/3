10/23/12 5:04 PM EDT | A narrow Obama win or a Romney landslide | <paragraph> Mika, Willie and I have spent the past few weeks answering the same question from viewers, family members and friends. "Who's going to win the election??" <paragraph> After the first debate, that question was asked in the form of a plea from Democrats. Before that, Republicans grimly asked for their prognosis, resigned to the fact that the answer would not be satisfying. <paragraph> I spent most of the year telling those who asked that the dynamics of the race suggested a narrow Barack Obama win. But that all changed after the president's Denver debacle. After that meltdown, I am the first to admit I have no idea how this will turn out. <paragraph> But I do know this: Mitt Romney will win the presidency if he wins Ohio. That's because the Republican candidate is nailing down the Southern swing states that he has to win. With Florida, North Carolina and Virginia moving his way, the battle now moves to the Midwest. <paragraph> If Romney's momentum is strong enough to erase the 10-point deficit he once faced in Ohio, expect him to carry other swing states like Nevada and Colorado. <paragraph> That scenario would have been far more plausible had Mr. Romney turned in a stronger performance at last night's debate in Florida. As things stand today, Ohio is still a heavy lift for the GOP candidate and that means President Obama should still be considered a slight favorite to win reelection. <paragraph> But my gut tells me there are two likely scenarios: (1) President Obama will squeak out a narrow Electoral College victory or (2) Mitt Romney will carry Ohio and be swept into office by a comfortable margin. <paragraph> After practicing politics for 20 years, I suppose I would rather be in Mitt Romney's shoes than Barack Obama's. Incumbents who are under 50 percent two weeks out usually go down to defeat. <paragraph> But who knows? Maybe Barack Obama will bend history once again.
