5/14/12 3:21 PM EDT  | Chris Christie defies gravity | <paragraph>  Once upon a time, the Northeast was ruled by Republicans.  <paragraph>  Yankee politicians like New York's Teddy Roosevelt, Massachusetts' Henry Cabot Lodge, Connecticut's Prescott Bush, New Hampshire's Warren Rudman, Rhode Island's John Chafee, Maine's William Cohen and Vermont's James Jeffords represented more than a century of GOP dominance in the North that began with the presidency of Abraham Lincoln and ended with George W. Bush's election.  <paragraph>  So overwhelming was GOP dominance in New England that the Democratic Party failed to win a single presidential contest in Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine throughout the 1970s and 1980s. That reality shifted dramatically in 1992. In fact, Republicans in presidential contests have lost all states north of Virginia since 1988, other than Bush's single victory in New Hampshire in 2000.  <paragraph>  These bitter realities that face all Northeast Republicans makes New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's latest poll numbers all the more remarkable.  <paragraph>  As noted by Chris Cillizza's "The Fix", Christie’s 56 percent approval rating in a recent Fairleigh Dickinson University poll tops President Obama's standing in that state as well as the approval ratings of New Jersey's two Democratic U.S. senators. In fact, neither Bob Menendez nor Frank Lautenberg have ever registered an approval rating as high the one Christie currently enjoys.  <paragraph>  How terrifying it must be to Democratic activists in the Garden State that Republican Chris Christie is one of the most popular politicians in the recent history of their very blue state. The New Jersey governor just brokered a tough collective bargaining deal with his state's largest unions so you can expect those high approval ratings to continue for a while.  <paragraph>  There are many lessons for Republicans to take away from Christie's success:  <paragraph>  1. FOCUS ON MATH, NOT IDEOLOGY When you focus on fixing deficits by showing voters raw numbers, independents and editorial boards will follow you. When you follow your base blindly into ideological fights (like abolishing collective bargaining before your state is ready for that), you take unnecessary risks.  <paragraph>  2. THINK BIG Friends of Chris Christie never expected him to be a transformative governor. But candidate Christie knew that New Jersey's finances were so screwed up that if he got elected, his only option would be to throw all he had at knocking down the state's debt. Going to war was a risk, but his greater risk would have been to do nothing at all. As the Templar Knight at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade said, <quotation>   And as I always said to politicians who came to my office seeking advice, "Nobody ever stops you when you're going 90 miles per hour."   <paragraph>  3. BE YOURSELF Chris Christie is a Jersey guy. He ain't going to be invited to the Newport Debutante Ball anytime soon. And even if he were, he'd probably decline the invitation. That's because Chris Christie is an unapologetic street fighter who doesn't bother playing nice for the cameras.  <paragraph>  Sometimes he comes across as a bully. Sometimes he talks when he should be quiet. Sometimes he might even embarrass himself. But know this: Chris Christie is always himself. And for New Jersey voters, that's good enough.
