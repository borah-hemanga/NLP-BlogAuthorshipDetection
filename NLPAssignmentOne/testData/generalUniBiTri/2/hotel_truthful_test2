10/15/12 10:13 PM EDT | Romney's Electoral College gains | <paragraph> Is Mitt Romney surging ahead of Barack Obama in the battleground states that will elect the next president? USA Today says "yes" and insiders in the Democratic Party are growing more concerned by the day that the President's built-in advantage in the Electoral College has all but disappeared. <paragraph> A new USA Today/Gallup poll has Romney leading President Obama by 4 percentage points among likely voters in 12 battleground states. The reason? USA Today says women in these swing states are moving Mitt's way. Time Magazine's Mark Halperin is also reporting tonight in an Electoral College update that a top Democratic source is worrying for the first time that Ohio may be slipping out of the Obama column and moving toward the tossup pile. <paragraph> Halperin explains: <quotation> <paragraph> Just yesterday, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll had President Obama surging ahead of Mitt Romney and breaking past the 50 percent mark, so who knows what the next poll brings. But one thing is certain, the tightening race does give us all one more reason to tune into Tuesday night's presidential debate.
5/28/12 10:12 AM EDT  | An enduring sacrifice few can understand |   <paragraph> I remember moving past the generals and politicians to greet grief-stricken family members who lost a loved one at Khobar Towers. The 1996 terrorist attack killed 19 U.S. servicemen stationed in Saudi Arabia and several of those killed in the attack were stationed at Eglin Air Force Base in the heart of my congressional district.  <paragraph>  I quietly shook hands with the parents who lost their sons, the wives who lost their husbands and the sisters who lost their brothers. And as is usually the case when military tragedies curse families, one can do little more in their presence than pray for the fallen and offer assistance for those family members left behind.  <paragraph>  I slowly made my way down the receiving line until I was stopped by the sight of a young boy who was staring ahead vacantly across the room, past the generals and politicians who were walking by to pay their last respects to his dad. My eyes began to well up at his sight and I moved quickly to hug the boy. All I could whisper was that I was so sorry for his loss. I moved away just as quickly to hide my eyes from him and go outside for the ceremony.  <paragraph>  The fact that the boy was the same age as my oldest son in 1996 is why I still remember that jarring encounter on this Memorial Day 16 years later. This morning I recall all I shared with my sons over those 16 years: the Little League games I got to coach, the birthday parties I got to attend, the Christmas Eve candlelight services I enjoyed with my family, the prom pictures I forced Joey and Andrew to endure while their dates smiled and they just stood there squirming in their misfitting tuxes.  <paragraph>  All these years later, I still pray to God every night that I will be around to see them graduate, get married, have children and move safely into middle age -- all the things this young boy would endure without his dad. I also pray that children of the fallen have loved ones to pick up the pieces and move them forward toward a fulfilled life, but I know that is not always the case.  <paragraph>  When we talk about the American heroes who give their all for their country, I wonder how many people realize that their sacrifice continues being paid every day. Then I wonder why Washington refuses to treat those heroes who come home with the respect they deserve.  <paragraph>  On this Memorial Day, let us hope that one day soon they will. May God bless our fallen heroes and their family members today and far into the future.
5/19/12 1:58 PM EDT  | These are not the Times to be biased | <paragraph>  Maybe I shouldn't be so tough on those I love. God knows I would have more friends in my own political party if I had kept my mouth shut while George W. Bush was running up trillions in debt and aping Woodrow Wilson on the world stage. But I can't help myself. Maybe I just expect more from those I love.  <paragraph>  Which brings me to the New York Times. I often criticize the Old Gray Lady despite the fact it's the one newspaper I must read daily.  <paragraph>  I expect its editorial page to reflect the liberal community it serves. And I endure its left-leaning story selection because it also brings the best writing and reporting in the world to my doorstep. But it tends to embarrass itself occasionally during heated presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>  The Times' public editor recently scolded his paper's past cheerleading for Barack Obama, and for good reason. The paper published separate profiles of John and Cindy McCain during the peak of the 2008 campaign that smeared the GOP nominee and his wife. When this kind of slanted reporting wins the day, I am as distressed at the Times' failings as I am when Republican politicians stop being conservative and start being radical. <paragraph>  This past week the Newspaper of Record ran a story above the fold on page one reporting that Republicans were preparing a new round of attacks on Barack Obama's relationship with Jeremiah Wright. They followed that Thursday story with a follow up article the next day. And then today, the Times' "Political Memo" stirred the pot again by writing this:  <paragraph>  A report in The New York Times on Thursday exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama’s onetime pastor, and his angry black-power sermons.  <paragraph>  Perhaps this news story might justify a three day roll out if, in fact, that narrative were accurate. Sadly, for the New York Times and Barack Obama's campaign, it is not.  <paragraph>  Despite what the Times claims, the undisputed facts are these: 1. There was no "secret plan" by "strategists" or "financiers" to push the Wright story, 2. The super pac in question asked advertisers to bring them ad ideas focused on the federal debt, 3. The ad man who pitched the idea to the super pac conceded that the group did not want proposals that dealt with anything other than fiscal issues, 4. Mitt Romney and his campaign had nothing to do with anything involving this ad. 5. The Republican Party had nothing to do with anything involving this pitch.   <paragraph>  Anyone who has spent any time working on a political campaign knows that terrible ideas bubble up and are popped by smart managers every five minutes or so. The fact that the New York Times decided to seize on a stupid idea by a guy not connected to (a) the super pac, (b) the RNC or (c) the Romney campaign shows just how much of a stretch it was to put Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg's story on the top of page one.  <paragraph>  Zeleny and Rutenberg are great reporters. And their story calling out a single strategist for pushing this self-destructive idea should find its way into the news stream. But until the New York Times begins publishing the moronic ideas of Democratic ad men making pitches to George Soros or Ted Turner, they should limit their breathless attacks against a political party they clearly oppose.  <paragraph>  This responsibility falls on the shoulders of editors who need to show a bit more partisan restraint on page one during election years. Such restraint will help them avoid the perception that they are shamelessly cheerleading for Democrats while maintaining the loyalty of many readers who do not share the editors' political views.
4/30/12 9:03 PM EDT | Hoover, Carter and cheap shots |  <paragraph>   <quotation>  wrote Finley Peter Dunne in an 1895 newspaper column explaining how Washington is not for the weak-hearted. And Mr. Dunne was right.  <paragraph>  All those hoping to find charity, love and justice on the campaign trail would do best to seek out the nearest church pew to rest their weary bones. That is because young politicians are taught daily just how rough the sport can be.  <paragraph>  In Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy's new book The President's Club, we see time and again how ex-presidents have been swept aside with brutish efficiency by the incoming president - whether it was Dwight Eisenhower coldly dispatching his former boss Harry Truman or John Kennedy dismissing Ike eight years later because he believed wrongly that the old general was hopelessly out of touch.   <paragraph>  But one of the most glaring examples of a president throwing a high, inside fastball on one of his predecessors was after Harry Truman had used Herbert Hoover from 1945 through 1948 to save millions of Europeans from starving after World War II. Truman also tapped Hoover to reorganize the federal government in a way that dramatically impacts even Barack Obama today. The alliance between Truman and Hoover was historic and, before long, the formerly disgraced GOP president became one of the most-admired men in America.   <paragraph>  Then came the 1948 election.  <paragraph>  Although Hoover gave the president his word that he would remain positive throughout the election, Gibbs and Duffy tell us that Harry Truman unloaded on the man who helped him save Europe from starvation and Soviet influence. On the campaign trail he would blame Hoover and the Republicans for causing the Great Depression while privately he would say, <quotation>    <paragraph>  But for Truman, politics was a tough game played by tough men, so he didn't give his strategy a second thought. And although Herbert Hoover was hurt by his friend's attacks, he swallowed his pride and continued his efforts reorganizing the executive branch for Truman and his successors.  <paragraph>  Given the long history of former presidents being used as political punching bags, I suppose I should not be surprised that these kind of attacks continue today. But I do wish ex-presidents would show the dignity and grace of George H.W. Bush in respecting the office of the presidency so much that they would choose to refrain from besmirching a member of the President's Club.  <paragraph>  I know this sounds old-fashioned and a bit out of touch with the realities of the 24/7 culture but I still revere the presidency even if I have been less than thrilled with the performance of some of its recent occupants.  <paragraph>  Which leads to a story that POLITICO is covering today regarding a man who hopes to become a member of the President's Club next January. Today, we heard Mitt Romney take a shot at the 39th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter. In responding to a reporter's question as to whether Romney would have ordered an attack on Osama bin Laden, the Republican front-runner said that  <quotation>     <paragraph>  That a GOP candidate would use Carter as a political target is not a surprise. We Republicans - and I include myself here - have been using President Carter as a political target for as long as Democrats lashed out at Hoover. But considering that Carter did the unthinkable by 2012 standards last week and praised Mitt Romney, I found his cheap shot at President Carter to be a bit jarring.  <paragraph>  Also, I wonder if there should be a statute of limitations on the political attacks the 39th president has to absorb. As a conservative who has been criticizing the former president for almost four decades now, I say enough is enough. All one has to do is read a few pages of Jimmy Carter's White House Diary or his recent Bible guide to get a better understanding of the challenges that constantly faced the man from Plains when he lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  <paragraph>  His were the same kind of monumental crises that Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton stared down daily. And while I will be the first to say that the people and the press have every right to challenge a sitting president every step of the way, I would suggest that after a president has been out of the Oval Office for 30 years, politicians should look elsewhere for cheap shots.
4/8/12 8:56 PM EDT | The message of Jesus |  <paragraph>  With the holiest week of the year coming to an end, now is a good time to reflect on the message of Jesus that has been twisted in knots by televangelists and politicians in our time.   <paragraph>  Jesus is not about getting rich. He's about feeding the poor.  <paragraph>  Jesus doesn't care about putting your favorite politician first. He cares about you putting yourself last.  <paragraph>  He doesn't want you to listen to self-righteous televangelists or self-promoting politicians. Instead, he wants you to read his words and learn the truth. And for the purposes of those who read this column, Jesus never focused on politics. He remained silent on gay marriage, liberation theology or abortion wars.  But he did command us to love others, forgive others and serve others.  <paragraph>  Then he told us we should love others more than we love ourselves, that we should love our enemies, that we must turn the other cheek, that the peacemakers are blessed and that we must focus more on our own sins instead of judging the faults of others.  <paragraph>  And when Jesus' disciples asked what they needed to do to get to Heaven, his answer was simple: care for the poor, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, give water to the thirsty, visit those in prison and bring hope to the hopeless.  <paragraph>  That is a radically different message than the one we hear from popular culture and misguided ministers. But that message contained in Matthew 25 remains the heart of the Son of God's message 2,000 years after he rose from the grave.  <paragraph>  That's also a message that sinners like myself must always remember and be challenged by every day.
3/21/12 7:50 AM EDT | Is Romney's fate Kristol clear? |  <paragraph>   While you were sleeping last night, most commentators called the GOP presidential fight for Methodical Mitt. Last night's win in Illinois was one of the cleaner victories for Team Romney though University of Virginia's Larry Sabato commented that it was     <quotation>       <paragraph>   Still, Sabato and others on National Review's Symposium posted early this morning concluded that the Republican race was all but over.    <paragraph>   Hugh Hewitt wrote that     <quotation>  <paragraph>   The National Review's Jim Geraghty said     <quotation>   <paragraph>   Time Magazine's Mark Halperin called the race for Romney. And given an April calendar that favors Mitt and the fundraising shortcomings of the other candidates, Mark may be right.    <paragraph>   Still, hope springs eternal for those hoping for a conservative knight in shining armor to emerge from Tampa, though some of us are starting to sound like Japanese soldiers burrowed into Pacific islands ready to fight a battle whose outcome is already determined.    <paragraph>   But don't expect Bill Kristol to march meekly behind the Republican Party's flawed front runner.    <paragraph>   This morning, Kristol told readers why Mitt Romney may have won the battle but conservatives are likely to lose the political war this fall with Barack Obama.    <paragraph>   <quotation>   <paragraph>   Put me in the Kristol camp. Faced with the historic opportunity to retain the House, take the Senate, win the White House and reshape the Supreme Court for a generation, the Republican Party seems destined to nominate a candidate they do not even like.
