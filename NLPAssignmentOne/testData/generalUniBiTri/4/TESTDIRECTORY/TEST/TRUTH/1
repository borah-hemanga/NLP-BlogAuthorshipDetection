10/25/12 5:47 AM EDT | Two new polls scream 'advantage Obama' | <paragraph> Two polls released yesterday show President Obama stubbornly clinging to his electoral advantage. TIME Magazine released a new Ohio poll that has Mitt Romney trailing in the Buckeye State by 5 points. Last week's NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey also had Romney behind by 5. <paragraph> TIME's poll should rattle the nerves of Romney supporters because the results run contrary to Team Romney's ongoing claim that their internal polls show a dead heat in the Buckeye State. Maybe that's the case among voters planning to go to the polls on election day but it looks like early voters are tilting dramatically in the president's direction. If the TIME poll is accurate, it means Mitt Romney will have to grab most of Ohio's remaining undecided voters if he wants to win this critical battleground state. <paragraph> PPP released a Nevada survey yesterday that also shows President Obama holding a lead in this key swing state that remains outside the margin of error. Like Ohio, Nevada remains stubbornly in the Obama column. While Mitt Romney has made up ground in the three Southern swing states of Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, voters in Ohio, Nevada and Wisconsin seem do not seem inclined to be easily swept into Romney's camp. <paragraph> Despite President Obama's advantage, his top advisors say we will not see the full impact of the final debate for a few more days. But at least for today, President Obama is holding onto his swing state advantage. And you can be sure that advantage will hold steady at least until a next batch of polls are released later today.
