11/7/12 1:05 AM EST | An Illinois bloodbath |   <paragraph>  After picking up four House seats in 2010, Illinois Republicans gave most of them back Tuesday as Democrats knocked off four GOP incumbents.  <paragraph>  Veteran Rep. Judy Biggert and freshmen Reps. Joe Walsh, Bobby Schilling and Bob Dold fell short in their re-election bids, victims of   <hyperlink>  new congressional lines that made it tougher to hold their seats. Between that and home state President Barack Obama's top-of-the-ticket presence -- he won 57 percent of the statewide vote -- it was too much to overcome.  <paragraph>  The battle for the state's two competitive open seats was a wash, with each party holding the one they controlled.  <paragraph>  National Republicans had long been concerned about their Illinois exposure and the result ends up being something close to a worst case scenario.
