2/17/12 3:36 PM EST | Statement by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski regarding Pat Buchanan |  <paragraph>   "Everyone at Morning Joe considers     <hyperlink>    Pat Buchanan to be a friend and a member of the family. Even though we strongly disagree with the contents of Pat's latest book, Mika and I believe those differences should have been debated in public. An open dialogue with     <hyperlink>    Morning Joe regulars like Al Sharpton and Harold Ford, Jr. could have developed into an important debate on the future of race relations in America.  <paragraph>   Because we believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant, Mika and I strongly disagree with this     <hyperlink>    outcome. We understand that the parting was amicable. Still, we will miss Pat."
