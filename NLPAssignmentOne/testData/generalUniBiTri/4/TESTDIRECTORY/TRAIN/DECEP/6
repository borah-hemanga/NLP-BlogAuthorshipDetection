11/12/12 5:35 PM EST | Romney's Oakland County blues |   <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  The Detroit Free Press captures Republican hand-wringing after another presidential loss in Michigan’s Oakland County, a one-time GOP suburban stronghold that again eluded the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  Without the county, the state’s second-most populous after Detroit’s Wayne County, Mitt Romney had no chance of carrying the state where he was born.  <paragraph>   <quotation>   <paragraph>  Romney’s local connections make his 54-46 loss there an especially bitter pill to swallow — he grew up in Oakland County, and his father served as governor of Michigan.  <paragraph>  While he ran 4 points ahead of John McCain’s pace in 2008, the fact that a candidate as well-suited for the area as Romney couldn’t win there is a telling sign of how damaged the GOP brand is in many of the Midwestern and Northeastern suburbs.  <paragraph>  While exit polls report Romney carried the suburbs 50-48 overall, he still fell short in many of the populous suburban counties that reliably powered GOP victories for decades — places like Oakland County.
