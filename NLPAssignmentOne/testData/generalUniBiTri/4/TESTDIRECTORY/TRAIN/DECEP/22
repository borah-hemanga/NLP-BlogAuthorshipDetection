10/31/12 12:51 PM EDT | W.Va. GOP: Stop Obama, vote straight ticket |  <paragraph>   In a state where President Obama is deeply unpopular and unlikely even to crack 40 percent on Election Day, the West Virginia Republican Party is urging voters to punish Democrats up and down the ballot, not just the president, by voting a straight Republican ticket. <paragraph>   From a West Virginia GOP email today:   <quotation>   <paragraph>   West Virginia is one of a declining number of states — 15 in all — that enables straight ticket voting, which allows voters to select a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single punch or mark on the ballot.  <paragraph>   There’s no real pattern to the list of states that still permit the practice — they’re red and blue, big and small, and spread across the map. The beneficiaries of the practice aren’t entirely obvious either — it depends on the state.  <paragraph>   There’s some irony in the West Virginia GOP’s call for a straight ticket vote — for years, it’s worked to the benefit of local Democrats.  <paragraph>   Still, it’s probably safe to assume that if straight ticket voting is going to have a significant impact this year it’s going to be in states like West Virginia or Utah, where the presidential vote is likely to be lopsided.
