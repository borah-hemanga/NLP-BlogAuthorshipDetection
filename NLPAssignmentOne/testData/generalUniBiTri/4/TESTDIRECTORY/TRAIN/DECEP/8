While Rasmussen wasn’t alone in misreading the composition of the 2012 electorate, and it’s true that all the firm’s battleground state polls were within the 4-point margin of error, there are a few clunkers in there. In Wisconsin, for example, Rasmussen was the only public pollster reporting a 49-49 tie — in the final two weeks, the five other pollsters in the field there pegged Obama’s lead at 3 and 9 percentage points. The actual result was a 53-46 Obama win.  <paragraph>  Colorado was similarly errant. In the final round of polls, Rasmussen was the one reporting the biggest Romney lead — 50-47 — but the outcome was 51-46 Obama.  <paragraph>  Rasmussen got a few states right — placing Obama in the lead in Nevada and New Hampshire and Romney ahead in North Carolina — but simply getting the winner correct in 3 of 9 battleground states isn’t going to win over the many detractors who regularly dismiss the firm’s polls for their often overly rosy GOP predictions.
