11/20/12 9:17 AM EST | The power of Calif.'s ethnic vote|   <paragraph>  Mitt Romney lost California by a landslide this year, but exit polls revealed he made big gains with one important demographic: white voters. In 2008, white Californians voted 52 to 46 percent for President Obama. In 2012, they flipped and voted 53-45 for Romney.  <paragraph>  In the end, though, it made almost no difference. Romney improved over John McCain’s weak 2008 performance by just 1 percentage point.  <paragraph>  Mark DiCamillo, director of California’s Field Poll,  <hyperlink>  explains the tectonic forces that made Romney’s gains largely irrelevant:  <quotation>  <paragraph>  This year’s exit polls suggest a dramatic change in the composition of the California electorate in just the past four years: The white share of the vote was 63 percent in 2008, then dropped to 55 percent in 2012.  <paragraph>  Demographic change isn’t the only story here. DiCamillo concludes that the best explanation for the growth in Latino, Asian-American and African-American support for Democratic candidates relates to their view of the role of government.  <paragraph>  While California's white non-Hispanics are evenly divided on whether the government should do more to solve the nation's problems, ethnic voters believe that government should be doing more by nearly 2 to 1.
11/13/12 5:40 PM EST | Dem. Senate incumbents outpaced Obama | <picture> Image courtesy of PoliticsPA  <paragraph>  The website   <hyperlink>  PoliticsPA crunches the numbers and finds that Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, whose lead appeared to be narrowing late in the campaign, ended up outperforming President Barack Obama nearly everywhere in Pennsylvania — including Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Casey wasn’t alone in running ahead of the president: Every Senate Democratic incumbent on the ballot, with the exception of Maryland’s Ben Cardin, outpaced Obama this year. So did a handful of challengers, including Tim Kaine of Virginia, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.  <paragraph>  None ran quite so far ahead of the ticket as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who was 25 percentage points ahead of the president and won 160,000 more votes than Obama — a stunning number for such a small state.  <paragraph>  How weak was Obama’s performance in West Virginia? Not only did he lose all 55 counties, he even won fewer votes than Manchin’s GOP opponent, John Raese.
11/9/12 6:05 AM EST | A nation of partisans |   <paragraph>  More signs of deep political polarization, this time from the National Conference of State Legislatures, which reports a notable drop in the number of states with a governor of one party and at least one chamber of the legislature of the opposite party.  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  The Thicket blog: <quotation>    <paragraph>  Those results track with a September   <hyperlink>  Gallup survey that reported a record-high 38% of Americans prefer that the same party control the presidency and Congress, while a record-low 23% said it would be better if the president and Congress were from different parties.  <paragraph>  One way to read the Gallup numbers is to consider them an expression of frustration with divided government in Washington. But when viewed in combination with what's happening in the states, you could also look at it as a sign of growing intolerance among voters for the opposing party.
11/7/12 1:05 AM EST | An Illinois bloodbath |   <paragraph>  After picking up four House seats in 2010, Illinois Republicans gave most of them back Tuesday as Democrats knocked off four GOP incumbents.  <paragraph>  Veteran Rep. Judy Biggert and freshmen Reps. Joe Walsh, Bobby Schilling and Bob Dold fell short in their re-election bids, victims of   <hyperlink>  new congressional lines that made it tougher to hold their seats. Between that and home state President Barack Obama's top-of-the-ticket presence -- he won 57 percent of the statewide vote -- it was too much to overcome.  <paragraph>  The battle for the state's two competitive open seats was a wash, with each party holding the one they controlled.  <paragraph>  National Republicans had long been concerned about their Illinois exposure and the result ends up being something close to a worst case scenario.
11/6/12 8:40 AM EST | Van Hollen's mixed message |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   It's not uncommon to tailor campaign mailers to specific audiences, but when the messages are this contradictory they tend to stand out — particularly when the Maryland Democratic Party sends them to the same household.  <paragraph>   In this case, the Rep. Chris Van Hollen-as-Paul Ryan's-worst-nightmare piece was sent to the registered Democrat in the house while the more conciliatory 'what divides us' piece was directed to the registered independent.  <paragraph>   It would have been hard to overlook the difference between the red meat mailer and the kinder, gentler piece in any congressional district, but it's especially glaring in Van Hollen's suburban Maryland district, where a high percentage of his constituents work in government or the business of politics.  <paragraph>   In any case, Van Hollen is expected to cruise to an easy victory in his solidly Democratic district.
11/2/12 6:24 PM EDT | Swing state nailbiters |  <paragraph>   President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are within 2 percentage points of each other in 6 swing states, according to Friday’s RealClearPolitics state polling averages.  <paragraph>   In three of those battleground states – Colorado, Florida and Virginia -- the race is within a single percentage point. The spread in Iowa, New Hampshire and Ohio is between 2.0 and 2.4 points.  <paragraph>   The biggest swing state gap is in Wisconsin, where Obama has a 5 point edge.  <paragraph>   Michigan and Pennsylvania, two states where the level of competitiveness is disputed by Democrats, both host tighter races than Wisconsin, according to RCP.  <paragraph>   In Pennsylvania, where Romney will campaign Sunday and his running mate Paul Ryan will stump on Saturday, the difference is 4.6 points. In Michigan, the spread is 3.5 points.
10/28/12 7:51 PM EDT | Register endorsement arrives late |  <paragraph>   As one of the great papers in presidential politics — and one of     <hyperlink>    four major Iowa newspapers to endorse Mitt Romney on Sunday — it's understandable that the Des Moines Register's endorsement would cause a     <hyperlink>    stir this weekend.   <paragraph>   But the impact of the paper’s decision, in terms of persuading voters, is likely limited. <paragraph>   It's not that the Register's endorsement doesn't matter. Rather, roughly a quarter of the state’s vote has already been cast.    <paragraph>   According to figures     <hyperlink>    released Friday by the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, 423,586 absentee votes have already been received. That represents 27 percent of the total votes cast in 2008.   <paragraph>   The late-in-the-campaign endorsements in Iowa and elsewhere suggest that many newspapers haven’t yet accounted for the dramatic growth in the percentage of early voting across the nation. In some states, for example, more than one-third of the vote has already been cast.  <paragraph>   The United States Election Project     <hyperlink>    estimates that, through Sunday, 13.8 million ballots have been cast in all reporting jurisdiction — roughly 10 percent of the total votes cast in the 2008 presidential election.
10/20/12 3:29 PM EDT | Dems hold smaller Nevada edge than '08 |    <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Democrats will go into Election Day with a 90,000 voter registration advantage in Nevada, a smaller edge than in 2008 when Barack Obama carried the state.    <paragraph>   At the     <hyperlink>    close of voter registration this week in the Mountain West swing state, there were 526,986 Democrats and 436,799 Republicans — a difference of 90,187 active voters.    <paragraph>   In 2008, at the close of registration, Democrats held a statewide advantage of 100,723 voters.    <paragraph>   While the statewide gap between the parties has closed slightly since 2008 — a year when Democratic registration surged in Nevada and Obama carried the state by 121,000 votes — the real growth was among independents. The number of nonpartisan registrations across the state grew by 36,000 since 2008.    <paragraph>   That spike in independents is a prominent feature of the 2012 swing state map.    <paragraph>   According to     <hyperlink>    an August report from the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina posted double-digit percentage gains in the number of independent voters since the last presidential election.
