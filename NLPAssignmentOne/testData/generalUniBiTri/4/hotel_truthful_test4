10/25/12 5:47 AM EDT | Two new polls scream 'advantage Obama' | <paragraph> Two polls released yesterday show President Obama stubbornly clinging to his electoral advantage. TIME Magazine released a new Ohio poll that has Mitt Romney trailing in the Buckeye State by 5 points. Last week's NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey also had Romney behind by 5. <paragraph> TIME's poll should rattle the nerves of Romney supporters because the results run contrary to Team Romney's ongoing claim that their internal polls show a dead heat in the Buckeye State. Maybe that's the case among voters planning to go to the polls on election day but it looks like early voters are tilting dramatically in the president's direction. If the TIME poll is accurate, it means Mitt Romney will have to grab most of Ohio's remaining undecided voters if he wants to win this critical battleground state. <paragraph> PPP released a Nevada survey yesterday that also shows President Obama holding a lead in this key swing state that remains outside the margin of error. Like Ohio, Nevada remains stubbornly in the Obama column. While Mitt Romney has made up ground in the three Southern swing states of Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, voters in Ohio, Nevada and Wisconsin seem do not seem inclined to be easily swept into Romney's camp. <paragraph> Despite President Obama's advantage, his top advisors say we will not see the full impact of the final debate for a few more days. But at least for today, President Obama is holding onto his swing state advantage. And you can be sure that advantage will hold steady at least until a next batch of polls are released later today.
6/6/12 10:49 PM EDT | Scott Walker's winning ways | <picture>  <paragraph>  Soon after the 2010 elections, Mika and I had a long dinner with David Axelrod about what went wrong for Democrats. During the dinner, a Republican operative walked over to our table and asked me to get up and visit the next table to meet the man who was just elected governor in Wisconsin. I walked over, met Scott Walker and immediately found myself unimpressed.  <paragraph>  Walker seemed too shy and too uncomfortable in Washington. I thought to myself that this was the kind of guy who gets swept into office during an ideological landslide and then gets booted out when the electorate moves back to the center a few years later. I saw that happen to many of my 1994 classmates. I saw it happen to Democrats who got elected in 2006. And I was pretty sure I would see it happen to Walker.  <paragraph>  Within a few months of his inauguration, I was sure of my prediction. Scott Walker quickly found himself in the middle of a political firestorm by moving too abruptly on union reform. Even though I was ideologically sympathetic to his cause, this looked like one more Republican leader who allowed himself to be painted as a right-wing extremist.  <paragraph>  I invited the governor on "Morning Joe" and immediately asked him if he had made a mistake moving forward too quickly on his agenda. His answer was a stunner.  <paragraph>  <quotation>  <paragraph>  Then the governor started calmly explaining how he had failed to listen to enough of his constituents before moving against collective bargaining. This was coming from a leader who had just endured a barrage of nasty personal attacks from political opponents he had just crushed in the Wisconsin legislature. After thanking Scott at the end of what I expected to be a contentious interview, I turned to Mika and said, "Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong about that guy."  <paragraph>  Few politicians were so graceful in victory as Walker and even fewer learned from their mistakes as quickly as he did in 2011. That humility was on full display last night as Walker used his acceptance speech to thank God, lift up his family and praise his Democratic opponent while telling Wisconsin Republicans to work harder on bipartisan compromise. He even used his speech to admit again that he should have listened more before moving on union reform. The governor told his partisan followers that  <quotation>   and that  <quotation>   <paragraph>  After watching last night's victory speech, my opinion of the shy politician I met in Washington in 2010 changed again. I decided that Scott Walker just might be that rare type of leader who is able to move an electorate his way by being blessed with the perfect proportions of courage and humility.  <paragraph>  That was a winning formula in Wisconsin last night and could be the way forward for a party that has recently had the habit of unnecessarily provoking persuadable voters. Hopefully, the governor will learn to deal with all of the indignities Washington brings because his party and country may need him as part of a national ticket in the coming years.
5/25/12 3:07 PM EDT | Gay marriage, abortion and the independent voter |   <paragraph>  With apologies to ideologues of all parties, the latest Gallup poll on abortion shows just how pragmatic American voters can be when it comes to social issues.  <paragraph>  That may come as news to extreme special interest groups on both sides of the aisle. After all, these organizations have made a good living through the years by pushing their own brand of morality on American voters. These advocacy groups have also contributed to the toxic environment in Washington by simplifying every issue and demonizing every opponent.  <paragraph>  Few issues have divided Washington and America more than abortion and gay marriage. And yet Americans are now declaring independence from rigid agendas by heading in opposite ideological directions in these two heated debates.  <paragraph>  According to recent surveys, voters are becoming more progressive on gay marriage. The divide-and-conquer strategy that worked for Republicans in 2004 will never again be as effective as it was during George W. Bush's reelection campaign.  <paragraph>  At the same time, voters are becoming more conservative on abortion. The latest Gallup poll shows that 50 percent of Americans identify themselves as pro-life. That's a 17 point jump from when the same question was asked by Gallup in 1996. A record low 41 percent of Americans surveyed now identify themselves as pro-choice. That is a 15 point drop since 1996.  <paragraph>  Despite large swings in the way voters identify themselves on this issue, politicians should also take note that the majority of Americans tell pollsters they still believe abortion should be legal in some cases.  <paragraph>  So what does it mean? Perhaps that attitudes on abortion are changing, but not overnight. The same is true of gay marriage, as Team Obama learned earlier this month. Chicago privately concedes that President Obama is now more likely to lose the swing state of North Carolina because of his recent statement on gay marriage.  <paragraph>  Republicans are just as likely to lose suburban women and other swing voters if they dart too far right on abortion over the next six months. The GOP presidential primary campaign underlined that fact in bright red ink earlier this year.  <paragraph>  Still, attitudes are changing on both issues. And any politician who believes he can blindly follow a tired party line will soon find himself out of touch and out of office.
5/2/12 9:09 PM EDT | Newt Gingrich's real legacy |    <paragraph>  With Newt Gingrich's belated exit from the Republican presidential campaign, now is a good time to ask what impact his vertiginous race will have on his legacy.   <paragraph>  My guess? Not much.  <paragraph>  Sure, we learned that the former speaker is undisciplined on the campaign trail, has a tumultuous past and is often ideologically inconsistent. But that's not news to anyone who worked with Mr. Gingrich for more than a week while he served in Congress. And Newt Gingrich served in Congress for a very long time.  <paragraph>  Instead, 2012 is just one more reminder of how in politics, a politician's past is always prologue. For Newt's campaign staff, that proved to be bad news.  <paragraph>  (<hyperlink> PHOTOS: Newt Gingrich's career)  <paragraph>  But despite the withering critiques of many (including myself), give Mr. Gingrich his due. History will record him as one of the most significant Republican figures of the last 50 years. For a short while in the 1990s, Newt Gingrich bent history. <paragraph>  He led Republicans to a majority in the House for the first time in 40 years,  He led the fight to balance the budget for the first time in a generation, He helped balance that budget for four consecutive years for the first time since the 1920s, He rammed through welfare reform despite initial opposition from Bill Clinton and the Democrats, and He extended the life of Medicare when Democrats chose to demagogue the issue  <paragraph>  Of course, many will also blame the Gingrich speakership for the poisonous atmosphere that infects Washington today, but vicious personal attacks in American politics predated Newt's 1994 rise by about 220 years. And since many of the same people who judged Gingrich for his take-no-hostages approach remained silent when Ted Kennedy accused Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork of supporting segregation, back-alley abortions and midnight police raids, those critiques are not worth the paper on which they are written.  <paragraph>  Newt Gingrich may have turned negative campaigning into a dark art form, but he was not its inventor.  <paragraph>  Newt's more lasting legacy will be what he accomplished in 1995 and 1996. For those achievements, Speaker Gingrich will long be remembered as the man who brought the Reagan Revolution to the Legislative Branch. That legacy remains secure tonight despite the ending of a very sloppy campaign.
4/16/12 8:43 PM EDT | In denial about debt crisis |   <paragraph>   With George Soros warning of a growing European crisis, the economic clouds that have been forming over Washington for years are growing darker by the day. While Soros fears that Europe's austerity measures will lead to a financial meltdown in the EU, at least European governments are trying something, anything, to stem the debt crisis.  <paragraph>  Stateside, today's events in Congress show just how ill-equipped our government is to face the coming storm.   <paragraph>  President Obama pushed for a Senate vote today on the Buffett Rule as a way to get rich Americans to pay more taxes. Of course, the president always knew the rule was more gimmick than economic panacea. He also knew it would never pass out of the least productive Senate in 20 years.   <paragraph>  Not to be outdone, House Republicans are pushing for a vote on a tax cut for businesses with less than 500 employees. Like the Buffett Rule, the Eric Cantor-backed tax cut has no chance of passing both chambers and ending up on the president's desk.  <paragraph>  The Washington Post summed up the parties' political gimmickry this afternoon: <quotation>  <paragraph>  To drive home the point that legislating is now little more than campaigning by different means, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer used the occasion of today's vote to suggest the provision's name should be changed to "The Romney Rule" because the presumptive GOP nominee is so rich.  <paragraph>  With all the game playing that is going on inside the Beltway, it is fair for voters to ask whether any adults are left working in a town that is always concerned with winning the next election rather than the new century.
3/31/12 1:57 PM EDT | The politics of justice |  <paragraph>  At the beginning of this week's momentous Supreme Court arguments, allies of the Affordable Health Care Act were predicting a rout for their side. Judicial experts even told the New York Times (and Morning Joe) that they would not be surprised if the White House won the case by an 8-1 vote.  <paragraph>  Much has changed since Monday. Now many expect the Supreme Court to strike down the individual mandate and possibly throw out the entire law. But just as I was skeptical when liberals were overconfident at the beginning of the week, I find it equally unrealistic for conservatives to expect to be given a clear cut victory.  <paragraph>  I still expect this case to come down to Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote. And while Kennedy gave conservatives the question of the week ( <quotation>  ), the moderate justice's history shows how hard it is to define his judicial philosophy.  <paragraph>  Court observers have long accused Kennedy of being influenced by what Federal Judge Lawrence Silberman once famously called the "Greenhouse Effect," a term coined to describe conservatives who compromise their principles in exchange for fawning press coverage from the New York Times--named in honor of former Times reporter Linda Greenhouse.  <paragraph>  The phenomenon of "playing to the crowds" has been in decline in recent years, with the court settling into a more ideologically predictable routine.  <paragraph>  Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito follow a more "conservative" line and do not give a damn what the New York Times editorial page has to say. The same can be said of Ginsburg, Kagan, Breyer and Sotomayor, who can be pigeonholed more often than not in the "liberal" camp.  <paragraph>  These days, only Anthony Kennedy moves freely across the political divide, and critics say he often does so with an eye less on the law before him than on his longterm legacy.  <paragraph>  One of the worst examples of the Supreme Court taking political considerations into their legal decisions came in the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where Anthony Kennedy and two other justices admitted as much in their decision.  <paragraph>  Writing for the three judge plurality, Sandra Day O'Connor based her decision to uphold Roe v. Wade on the assertion that women now relied on abortion so much that to allow states to regulate it in a restrictive manner would create chaos. Even more disturbing was O'Connor and Kennedy's bizarre claim that upholding Roe was required if the Court hoped to protect its institutional legitimacy.  <paragraph>  The Court wrote, <quotation>  <paragraph>  As Notre Dame professor of law O. Carter Snead told me earlier this week, legal commentators across the ideological spectrum denounced the ruling as an abrogation of judicial authority without even the pretense of sound constitutional reasoning.  <paragraph>  That Kennedy and O'Connor would admit in a Supreme Court decision that they feared reversing constitutional error because of political recriminations should be shocking to even the most casual observer of the Court.  <paragraph>  Why does this matter now? Because the only lesson Anthony Kennedy has learned from Casey is that one should not admit publicly to caring more about political considerations than constitutional law.  <paragraph>  For the moment, conservatives can count themselves lucky that 67% of Americans want the Court to overturn the President's health care law. But if those numbers change as its repeal begins to look more likely, Anthony Kennedy may start looking for guidance from the crowds and the New York Times editorial page. When that happens, all legal reasoning takes a back seat to pure politics.
2/22/12 4:46 PM EST | Just your average, run of the mill blog on state-sanctioned vaginal probes | <paragraph>   Great news out of Richmond, VA for Republicans who actually like winning general elections. Late word today that Governor     <hyperlink>    Bob McDonnell has effectively killed a bill that would have sanctioned state-ordered vaginal probes for women seeking to engage in a legal activity.  <paragraph>   This afternoon the Governor released the following statement:    <quotation>      <paragraph>   Regardless of your position on abortion, Bob McDonnell's move makes it more likely that Republicans can take the state out of Barack Obama's column this fall. It also keeps the Virginia governor in the running for VP.  <paragraph>   No word yet on whether Virginia's GOP legislators will now attempt to alienate the rest of the Commonwealth's voters by ordering state-sanctioned anal probes for men seeking public funding for their Viagra supplies.
4/7/12 8:21 PM EDT | Subtlety at the Times this holy week |    <paragraph>       <picture>   <paragraph>   You have to give the New York Times editors credit. With 2 billion Christians worldwide to choose from, they found a small group of pilgrims in Spain looking like exaggerated versions of Ku Klux Klan members to place on their front page on this Holy Weekend. It would be hard to imagine the Times editors finding  a group of worshipping Christians that would appear more ghoulish to Times readers than the image chosen.    <paragraph>   Very subtle.
