2/14/12 7:00 PM EST | The truth about entitlement spending | <paragraph>   If you want to know why Republicans and Democrats can't make progress on long-term deficit reduction, take a look at the segment below from Morning Joe. In our roundtable discussion, my good friend Jeffrey Sachs (I need to underline that point before you actually watch the segment) claims that entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not cause the national debt to balloon over the next generation.   <paragraph>   Despite my great respect for Dr. Sachs, the Columbia professor's math doesn't seem to add up. <paragraph>   Financier and former Obama Car Czar Steve Rattner came to play today with handy charts that show entitlement spending devouring 40% of federal spending in 2012. Within the decade, that number expands to 54%, and goes much higher in the out years. Steve also described a crowding out of federal investment in discretionary programs like education, R&D and infrastructure because of an ever-growing entitlement system fueled by an aging population and rising health care costs.  <paragraph>   Dr. Sachs did admit that entitlement spending was on a sharp upward trajectory but was unwilling to embrace the type of reforms that I believe will prevent the collapse of Medicare in the future.  <paragraph>   But progressives are not alone in their collective state of denial regarding Medicare. In one of the most depressing poll results registered over the past few years, self-described Tea Party members were surveyed last spring     <hyperlink>    in a Marist poll and asked if they supported Medicare spending reforms. A pathetic 70% said     <quotation>    proving once again that when it comes to entitlement programs, some Americans just don't want to hear the truth.   <paragraph>   But the truth is that Medicare and Medicaid are the biggest drivers of America's national debt over the next generation. And that is not a matter of ideology. That is a matter of math. <video>
