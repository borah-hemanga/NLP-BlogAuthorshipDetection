10/17/12 9:55 AM EDT | The final days of Laura Richardson |     <paragraph>       <picture>  <paragraph>   The House election homestretch always seems to feature one member of Congress who essentially gives up before Election Day, and this cycle that member appears to be California Democratic Rep. Laura Richardson.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    POLITICO’s Jessica Meyers:    <quotation>       <paragraph>   By raising just $7,000 in the latest quarter — a paltry sum for a member of Congress, let alone one who is engaged in a tough  incumbent vs. incumbent matchup — Richardson appears to have concluded some time ago that there’s no viable path to reelection.    <paragraph>   The congresswoman finished 20 percentage points behind Hahn in California's June "top-two" primary, a disheartening sign since they were the only two candidates running. The result offered little hope that Richardson could close the gap by November.    <paragraph>   Redistricting-related changes to her seat and the congresswoman’s ethics issues were hard enough to overcome, but without any cash — Richardson had just $68,000 cash on hand at the end of September — it’s nearly impossible.
