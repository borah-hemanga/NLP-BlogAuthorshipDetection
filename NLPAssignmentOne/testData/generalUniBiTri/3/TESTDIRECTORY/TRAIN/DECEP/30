10/20/12 3:29 PM EDT | Dems hold smaller Nevada edge than '08 |    <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Democrats will go into Election Day with a 90,000 voter registration advantage in Nevada, a smaller edge than in 2008 when Barack Obama carried the state.    <paragraph>   At the     <hyperlink>    close of voter registration this week in the Mountain West swing state, there were 526,986 Democrats and 436,799 Republicans — a difference of 90,187 active voters.    <paragraph>   In 2008, at the close of registration, Democrats held a statewide advantage of 100,723 voters.    <paragraph>   While the statewide gap between the parties has closed slightly since 2008 — a year when Democratic registration surged in Nevada and Obama carried the state by 121,000 votes — the real growth was among independents. The number of nonpartisan registrations across the state grew by 36,000 since 2008.    <paragraph>   That spike in independents is a prominent feature of the 2012 swing state map.    <paragraph>   According to     <hyperlink>    an August report from the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina posted double-digit percentage gains in the number of independent voters since the last presidential election.
