That means that every afternoon for the next 201 days, we will be greeted with horse-race updates that are sure to be followed by breathless headlines about how that day's results surely spell doom for President Obama or Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>  On this second day of Gallup's tracking poll, the survey was met with a screaming headline on The Drudge Report that yelled  <quotation>  So what's the earth-shattering news that deserved such a headline?
