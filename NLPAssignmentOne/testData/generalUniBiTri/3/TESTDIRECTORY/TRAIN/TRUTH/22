3/31/12 1:57 PM EDT | The politics of justice |  <paragraph>  At the beginning of this week's momentous Supreme Court arguments, allies of the Affordable Health Care Act were predicting a rout for their side. Judicial experts even told the New York Times (and Morning Joe) that they would not be surprised if the White House won the case by an 8-1 vote.  <paragraph>  Much has changed since Monday. Now many expect the Supreme Court to strike down the individual mandate and possibly throw out the entire law. But just as I was skeptical when liberals were overconfident at the beginning of the week, I find it equally unrealistic for conservatives to expect to be given a clear cut victory.  <paragraph>  I still expect this case to come down to Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote. And while Kennedy gave conservatives the question of the week ( <quotation>  ), the moderate justice's history shows how hard it is to define his judicial philosophy.  <paragraph>  Court observers have long accused Kennedy of being influenced by what Federal Judge Lawrence Silberman once famously called the "Greenhouse Effect," a term coined to describe conservatives who compromise their principles in exchange for fawning press coverage from the New York Times--named in honor of former Times reporter Linda Greenhouse.  <paragraph>  The phenomenon of "playing to the crowds" has been in decline in recent years, with the court settling into a more ideologically predictable routine.  <paragraph>  Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito follow a more "conservative" line and do not give a damn what the New York Times editorial page has to say. The same can be said of Ginsburg, Kagan, Breyer and Sotomayor, who can be pigeonholed more often than not in the "liberal" camp.  <paragraph>  These days, only Anthony Kennedy moves freely across the political divide, and critics say he often does so with an eye less on the law before him than on his longterm legacy.  <paragraph>  One of the worst examples of the Supreme Court taking political considerations into their legal decisions came in the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where Anthony Kennedy and two other justices admitted as much in their decision.  <paragraph>  Writing for the three judge plurality, Sandra Day O'Connor based her decision to uphold Roe v. Wade on the assertion that women now relied on abortion so much that to allow states to regulate it in a restrictive manner would create chaos. Even more disturbing was O'Connor and Kennedy's bizarre claim that upholding Roe was required if the Court hoped to protect its institutional legitimacy.  <paragraph>  The Court wrote, <quotation>  <paragraph>  As Notre Dame professor of law O. Carter Snead told me earlier this week, legal commentators across the ideological spectrum denounced the ruling as an abrogation of judicial authority without even the pretense of sound constitutional reasoning.  <paragraph>  That Kennedy and O'Connor would admit in a Supreme Court decision that they feared reversing constitutional error because of political recriminations should be shocking to even the most casual observer of the Court.  <paragraph>  Why does this matter now? Because the only lesson Anthony Kennedy has learned from Casey is that one should not admit publicly to caring more about political considerations than constitutional law.  <paragraph>  For the moment, conservatives can count themselves lucky that 67% of Americans want the Court to overturn the President's health care law. But if those numbers change as its repeal begins to look more likely, Anthony Kennedy may start looking for guidance from the crowds and the New York Times editorial page. When that happens, all legal reasoning takes a back seat to pure politics.
