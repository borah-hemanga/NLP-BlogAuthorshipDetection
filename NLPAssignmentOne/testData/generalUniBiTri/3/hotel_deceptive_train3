11/20/12 11:26 AM EST  | The GOP's 2012 diversity disaster | <picture>   <paragraph>  Florida Republican Rep. Allen West’s   <hyperlink>  concession Tuesday makes it official: The 2012 election was a disaster for the GOP’s efforts to diversify the face of the party.  <paragraph>  The number of African-American Republicans in Congress, which stood to double thanks to several highly competitive candidates, was instead cut in half. In addition to West’s reelection loss, top House prospects Vernon Parker in Arizona and Mia Love in Utah also fell short, leaving Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina as the lone black GOP House member in the 113th Congress.  <paragraph>  In a year when a record number of Hispanics were elected to Congress, Republicans also ended up losing two of their already small contingent: Reps. Francisco Canseco of Texas and David Rivera of Florida, both of whom were defeated in their bids for a second term.  <paragraph>  In addition, the party failed to elect one of its most promising Hispanic candidates, former California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado, and saw GOP Gov. Luis Fortuño defeated in Puerto Rico.  <paragraph>  In the Senate, which will have a record number of women next year, the number of female Republican senators declined by one. While Republican Deb Fischer was elected to Nebraska’s open Senate seat, five other female GOP nominees lost — placing the number of GOP women in the Senate at 4.  <paragraph>  Meanwhile, Democrats elected 4 new women and re-elected 6 female Senate incumbents, giving the party 16 female senators.  <paragraph>  There was one promising sign this year for the GOP amid the lost opportunities: The election of Ted Cruz to an open Texas Senate seat. His victory means the party now boasts Hispanic senators in two of the nation’s largest states (the other is Florida’s Marco Rubio).  <paragraph>  Since the GOP can also point to two Hispanic governors (Democrats have none), Republicans are now arguably better positioned than Democrats to put a Hispanic on the presidential ticket in 2016.
11/20/12 9:17 AM EST | The power of Calif.'s ethnic vote|   <paragraph>  Mitt Romney lost California by a landslide this year, but exit polls revealed he made big gains with one important demographic: white voters. In 2008, white Californians voted 52 to 46 percent for President Obama. In 2012, they flipped and voted 53-45 for Romney.  <paragraph>  In the end, though, it made almost no difference. Romney improved over John McCain’s weak 2008 performance by just 1 percentage point.  <paragraph>  Mark DiCamillo, director of California’s Field Poll,  <hyperlink>  explains the tectonic forces that made Romney’s gains largely irrelevant:  <quotation>  <paragraph>  This year’s exit polls suggest a dramatic change in the composition of the California electorate in just the past four years: The white share of the vote was 63 percent in 2008, then dropped to 55 percent in 2012.  <paragraph>  Demographic change isn’t the only story here. DiCamillo concludes that the best explanation for the growth in Latino, Asian-American and African-American support for Democratic candidates relates to their view of the role of government.  <paragraph>  While California's white non-Hispanics are evenly divided on whether the government should do more to solve the nation's problems, ethnic voters believe that government should be doing more by nearly 2 to 1.
11/19/12 12:13 PM EST  | Obama's big county blowouts | <picture> Courtesy of Larry J. Sabato's Crystal Ball  <paragraph>  Here’s a stat that provides a measure of how thoroughly the GOP presidential ticket got thrashed in the “urban areas” Paul Ryan referred to: Mitt Romney lost 44 of the nation’s top 50 most populous counties on Election Day, a significant fall off from George W. Bush’s 2000 performance in those places.  <paragraph>  According to an analysis by Larry Sabato’s   <hyperlink>  Crystal Ball website, Bush won 16 big counties in his first bid, compared to just 6 for Romney. The majority of those counties weren’t close in 2012 — President Barack Obama won more than 55 percent of the vote in 34 of them.  <paragraph>  Many of the top 50 counties include big cities and have majority minority populations, so the results sketch out the full contours of the GOP’s weakness in urban America and among minority voters.  <paragraph>  The Crystal Ball research suggests the problem is getting worse in many places, not better. Consider Los Angeles County, the nation’s single largest county. In 1988, Michael Dukakis won 52-47 there. By 2000, the margin was 64-32 for Al Gore. This year, Obama won 69-29.  <paragraph>  Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County is a similar story: 59-40 Dukakis in 1988, 63-33 Gore in 2000 and 69-30 Obama in 2012.  <paragraph>  Even the big counties that once favored the GOP are drifting out of the party’s orbit as they diversify.  <paragraph>  In 1988, Charlotte’s Mecklenburg County gave George H.W. Bush 59 percent of the vote. By 2000, the GOP advantage in North Carolina’s most populous county was down to 51-48. This year, Barack Obama won 61-38.  <paragraph>  Then there’s Orange County, Calif. — the onetime conservative stronghold that Ronald Reagan called the place  <quotation>    <paragraph>  GOP presidential performance there declined from 68 percent in 1988 to 53 percent in 2012. The good news for Republicans? That 53 percent represents an uptick from John McCain’s 50 percent in 2008.
11/15/12 4:10 PM EST | Georgia GOPers fall short |  <paragraph>  The Georgia Tipsheet blog   <hyperlink>  notes that the House GOP leadership elections were a flop for Georgia, which saw two members of its delegation fall short. <paragraph>  Rep. Tom Price lost to Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Wednesday in his bid to become conference chairman while Rep. Tom Graves lost Thursday in his attempt to head the Republican Study Committee.  <paragraph>  While it’s a blow to Georgia interests, the outcomes are probably a net plus for the House GOP in the wake of an election that underscored the party’s weakness in competing with women and in regions outside the South.  <paragraph>  Had Price and Graves won the posts they vied for, top House leadership would have consisted of 5 white males, three of them from the South. The new team will now have one woman at the table, and will have more regional balance – two from the West (McMorris Rodgers and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California), a Midwesterner in Speaker John Boehner and two Southerners, Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and Republican Study Committee Chair Steve Scalise of Louisiana.  <paragraph>  Still, the GOP's congressional wing has a ways to go in presenting a different face to voters. As POLITICO's Manu Raju and Jake Sherman   <hyperlink>  report, the House and Senate GOP chose four women lawmakers out of 14 spots for senior leadership positions.
11/13/12 7:10 PM EST  | Scott Brown's comeback tour |  <picture>  <paragraph>  He might have lost his Senate seat last week, but Scott Brown is still very much in the game.  <paragraph>  Between the 2014 Massachusetts governor’s race and the swirling rumors regarding a possible Cabinet position for Sen. John Kerry, several promising   <hyperlink>  opportunities might soon present themselves to Brown.  <paragraph>  In a media availability Tuesday in Washington, the senator dodged questions about his future.  <paragraph>   <quotation>  <hyperlink>  Brown said. <quotation>    <paragraph>  Given his track record — a giant special election upset and a respectable loss in his bid to win a full term — and the Massachusetts GOP’s thin bench, Brown has far more leverage than the typical election loser in choosing an avenue of return.  <paragraph>  If he’s interested in returning to the Senate, however, Brown is looking at a daunting scenario. If Kerry steps down, Brown would have to run next year in a 2013 Senate special election, followed by the regularly scheduled 2014 election for the full six-year term. That would make four grueling statewide campaigns in five years in a heavily Democratic state — the 2010 special, the 2012 general election against Elizabeth Warren, a 2013 special and a 2014 general.
11/13/12 5:40 PM EST | Dem. Senate incumbents outpaced Obama | <picture> Image courtesy of PoliticsPA  <paragraph>  The website   <hyperlink>  PoliticsPA crunches the numbers and finds that Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, whose lead appeared to be narrowing late in the campaign, ended up outperforming President Barack Obama nearly everywhere in Pennsylvania — including Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Casey wasn’t alone in running ahead of the president: Every Senate Democratic incumbent on the ballot, with the exception of Maryland’s Ben Cardin, outpaced Obama this year. So did a handful of challengers, including Tim Kaine of Virginia, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.  <paragraph>  None ran quite so far ahead of the ticket as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who was 25 percentage points ahead of the president and won 160,000 more votes than Obama — a stunning number for such a small state.  <paragraph>  How weak was Obama’s performance in West Virginia? Not only did he lose all 55 counties, he even won fewer votes than Manchin’s GOP opponent, John Raese.
11/12/12 2:53 PM EST | A GOP call for reform in Minnesota | <paragraph>  A critical part of the GOP’s path forward is a reexamining of process — in other words, looking closely at the institutional factors that are generating unelectable nominees.  <paragraph>  In Minnesota, where first-term Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar won a landslide victory over largely unknown Republican state Rep. Kurt Bills, former state GOP Executive Director Ben Golnik   <hyperlink>  calls for an end to the complicated candidate-endorsement process that helped deliver the nomination to Bills.  <paragraph>   <quotation>    <paragraph>  Calls to reform the nominating process in states like Minnesota aren’t new, but it’s possible they’ll take on an increased urgency in the wake of two successive national election cycles marked by unusually weak Republican general election candidates.  <paragraph>  The problem, of course, is that pure primary elections aren’t a cure-all. Primaries have produced the most notorious GOP nominees of the past two cycles — the ones who essentially handed over seats to Democratic candidates.
11/11/12 1:05 PM EST | Rasmussen explains |   <paragraph>  Rasmussen Reports, the prolific automated pollster whose projections fell far from the mark Tuesday,  <hyperlink>  explains what went wrong:  <quotation>   <paragraph>  As mea culpas go, this one is a little thin. While Rasmussen wasn’t alone in misreading the composition of the 2012 electorate, and it’s true that all the firm’s battleground state polls were within the 4-point margin of error, there are a few clunkers in there. In Wisconsin, for example, Rasmussen was the only public pollster reporting a 49-49 tie — in the final two weeks, the five other pollsters in the field there pegged Obama’s lead at 3 and 9 percentage points. The actual result was a 53-46 Obama win.  <paragraph>  Colorado was similarly errant. In the final round of polls, Rasmussen was the one reporting the biggest Romney lead — 50-47 — but the outcome was 51-46 Obama.  <paragraph>  Rasmussen got a few states right — placing Obama in the lead in Nevada and New Hampshire and Romney ahead in North Carolina — but simply getting the winner correct in 3 of 9 battleground states isn’t going to win over the many detractors who regularly dismiss the firm’s polls for their often overly rosy GOP predictions.
11/9/12 6:30 AM EST  | The GOP's big city problem | <picture> <paragraph>  There’s at least one ray of hope for the GOP in Mitt Romney’s loss Tuesday: Exit polls show he won back the suburbs from President Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Romney won the suburbs 50 percent to 48 percent, recapturing them after Obama won the crabgrass frontier by the same margin in 2008.  <paragraph>  It’s an important symbolic win for the GOP since, with few exceptions, the suburbs have been the province of the Republican Party in post-war presidential elections.  <paragraph>  But Romney’s victory margin in the suburbs wasn’t by nearly enough, and it underscores a problem confronting the GOP. While the suburbs powered the GOP for decades, they also created a false sense of security — and a political dependency — that threatens the party’s future in an era of when most of the older suburbs are firmly in the Democratic column and many of the newer ones are up for grabs.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  Sommer Mathis of the Atlantic Cities website puts it succinctly:  <quotation>    <paragraph>  Even if you don’t buy the recent analysis that cities are growing faster than the suburbs, the big city Democratic landslides (71% in 2000, 60% in 2004, 70% in 2008, and now 69% in 2012 in cities of over 500,000) are a serious issue for the GOP in an era when the suburbs are an unreliable constituency. <paragraph>  A case in point is Pennsylvania, where Romney ran more competitively than John McCain in the Big Four suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia — and even won one of them by a razor-close margin — but was still swamped by Philadelphia, which delivered a Democratic margin in the neighborhood of 465,000 votes.  <paragraph>  The GOP practice of ignoring the cities made political sense for decades, when the suburbs and urban America were at odds. The GOP was unquestionably the party of the suburbs — it celebrated the suburban way of life in a way that Democrats did not because of their urban base — and the party presented itself as a bulwark against the crime and dysfunction of the Democratic central cities. But as the cities came under a new generation of leadership in the 1990s and the suburbs began to mature and diversify — not to mention share some of the same problems as the central cities — the GOP’s grip began to loosen.  <paragraph>  There were other important factors in play as well — Democrats began to compete more aggressively for the suburban vote and many suburbs dislodged themselves from the GOP as the party moved to a more socially conservative posture. <paragraph>  In 2004, it looked like the exurbs might be the answer to the GOP’s declining suburban strength. But the housing market crash and recession has put a brake on exurban growth and there are signs in key swing states like Virginia that Democrats can compete — or at least not get killed there.  <paragraph>  Back in 1952, GOP Sen. Robert Taft made the prescient, though not entirely correct, prediction that  <quotation>   <paragraph>  The same can’t be said of the GOP and its big city problem — big cities still only constitute 11 percent of the electorate, according to exit polls. But the combination of a fickle suburban vote and a Democratic urban hammerlock is a formula for defeat in many states, as Romney learned Tuesday.
11/9/12 6:05 AM EST | A nation of partisans |   <paragraph>  More signs of deep political polarization, this time from the National Conference of State Legislatures, which reports a notable drop in the number of states with a governor of one party and at least one chamber of the legislature of the opposite party.  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  The Thicket blog: <quotation>    <paragraph>  Those results track with a September   <hyperlink>  Gallup survey that reported a record-high 38% of Americans prefer that the same party control the presidency and Congress, while a record-low 23% said it would be better if the president and Congress were from different parties.  <paragraph>  One way to read the Gallup numbers is to consider them an expression of frustration with divided government in Washington. But when viewed in combination with what's happening in the states, you could also look at it as a sign of growing intolerance among voters for the opposing party.
11/8/12 10:06 AM EST | What color is Pennsylvania? | <paragraph>  With President Barack Obama’s victory Tuesday, Pennsylvania has voted Democratic for president in six consecutive elections. It’s become something of a presidential year mirage for Republicans, always within sight, but never in the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  It’s not that Pennsylvania is unwinnable for the GOP: As Marcel Groen, Democratic chairman of suburban behemoth Montgomery County, reminds the   <hyperlink>  Philadelphia Inquirer, <quotation>    <paragraph>  It’s also true that Obama’s 2008 statewide margin was cut in half and that Mitt Romney was competitive in three of the big four suburban counties that ring Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Still, in the wake of Tuesday’s results, it seems highly unlikely that Pennsylvania will emerge as a key battleground state in 2016 – and even a blowout GOP win in the 2014 midterm election is unlikely to change that. After all, that’s exactly what happened in Pennsylvania in 2010, and it proved to be a harbinger of nothing.
11/8/12 9:28 AM EST  | GOP fortunes: From bad to worse in Calif. |   <paragraph>  After a rough election night for Republicans in the nation’s most populous state,  <hyperlink>   the Los Angeles Times sets the scene in California for the next two years:  <quotation>     <paragraph>  Just when it looked like things couldn’t get any worse for Republicans in California, it appears they did. And at the congressional level, there are still three uncalled House races where GOP incumbents are trailing their Democratic challengers with 100 percent of the votes in.  <paragraph>  California Republican Party Chairman Tom Del Beccaro issued this statement Wednesday in response to the election results, which included a big win for labor on a payroll deduction ballot measure.  <paragraph>   <quotation>    <paragraph>  The presidential exit polls paint an especially grim picture that suggests the state won't be competitive in any way for a long time. Obama won every income group, every education group, big and small cities, suburbs and independents.  <paragraph>  While Mitt Romney carried the white vote with 53 percent, Obama won other race and ethnicity groups by an even wider margin than nationally: 96 percent among black voters, 72 percent among Hispanics, 79 percent among Asians.
11/7/12 4:05 PM EST | PPP nailed it |  <paragraph>  The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling, which took flak all year long from Republicans complaining about its partisan bias, had a very, very good Election Day.  <paragraph>  In every swing state, its final presidential polls were validated Tuesday night as PPP reported the correct winner in all 9 battlegrounds and in the 3 other states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania) that the Romney campaign feinted toward.  <paragraph>  In its final state polls before the election, PPP had President Obama ahead in every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reported a statistical tie with Romney at 49.4 and Obama at 49.2. And that’s very close to how it all played out.  <paragraph>  While more than a few firms picked the right winners, PPP also nailed the exact result — at the moment, at least — in Florida, 50-49. And in most cases it was never more than a point or two off each candidate’s performance.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  A Fordham University report released Wednesday ranked the firm first among 28 organizations for the accuracy of its final, national preelection estimates.  <paragraph>  The story in the Senate was much the same for PPP. It correctly picked every winner and, in most cases, slightly understated Democratic support and overstated GOP support.  <paragraph>  The uniformity of its final, pre-election surveys — for Obama, nearly up-and-down the line — left PPP  <hyperlink>  highly exposed in the event of a Romney victory.  <paragraph>  Now, however, the firm can always point to the 2012 scoreboard when confronted with the invariable criticism directed its way.
11/7/12 1:05 AM EST | An Illinois bloodbath |   <paragraph>  After picking up four House seats in 2010, Illinois Republicans gave most of them back Tuesday as Democrats knocked off four GOP incumbents.  <paragraph>  Veteran Rep. Judy Biggert and freshmen Reps. Joe Walsh, Bobby Schilling and Bob Dold fell short in their re-election bids, victims of   <hyperlink>  new congressional lines that made it tougher to hold their seats. Between that and home state President Barack Obama's top-of-the-ticket presence -- he won 57 percent of the statewide vote -- it was too much to overcome.  <paragraph>  The battle for the state's two competitive open seats was a wash, with each party holding the one they controlled.  <paragraph>  National Republicans had long been concerned about their Illinois exposure and the result ends up being something close to a worst case scenario.
11/3/12 4:14 PM EDT | N.J. grapples with Sandy confusion | <paragraph>  <picture>  <paragraph> The Star Ledger  <hyperlink> reports Saturday that there’s widespread confusion across New Jersey <quotation>  <paragraph> Conventional wisdom has held that, since New Jersey is a strongly Democratic state and Democratic strongholds in north Jersey took a beating from Hurricane Sandy, President Obama’s popular vote totals stands to be diminished by the prospect of decreased turnout.  <paragraph>   While that may be true, it’s often overlooked that the GOP vote could be significantly affected – the superstorm devastated some of the few Republican strongholds in the state, from Cape May north to Monmouth County. Ocean County, which delivered a 50,000-vote GOP margin in 2008, was especially hard hit.  <paragraph>   In any case, there's little evidence to suggest that the ultimate outcome is going be affected -- the state's 14 electoral votes appear firmly ensconced in the Democratic column.  <paragraph>   (h/t Ginger Gibson)
11/3/12 1:48 PM EDT |Obama leads among Asian Americans |  <paragraph>   A new California poll shows why President Barack Obama is again expected to capture the Asian American vote.  <paragraph>   In the state with by far the largest Asian population in the nation, the Field Poll reports Obama holds a 58 percent to 25 percent lead over Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>   In 2008, national exit polls gave Obama a 62 percent to 35 percent advantage over John McCain among Asians, who made up two percent of the electorate.  <paragraph>   According to a  <hyperlink>  Field Poll released Saturday, Obama runs best among California’s Chinese Americans, a group he wins by 63-21. The margin with Vietnamese Americans – a demographic that tends to be more Republican-friendly – is 47-27. Among Korean Americans, Obama leads 41-20 with 39 percent undecided -- the reported percentage of undecided voters among all Asian subgroups is unusually high for this late point in the campaign.  <paragraph>   Among other Asian groups, Obama leads 62-28.  <paragraph>   There’s no data for the Filipino American vote, a constituency where Republicans have had a toehold in the past.  <paragraph>   While the poll notes that the Asian subgroup samples are small, the numbers don’t seem dramatically at odds with a national poll conducted in April by the Democratic firm Lake Research Partners. Back then, nearly six in 10 Asian voters also favored Obama.
11/2/12 12:00 PM EDT | GOP ahead of 2008 early vote pace |  <paragraph>   Until Election Day, there’s no way to know for certain whether or not the GOP’s ground game is better this year than in 2008.  <paragraph>   But by one important yardstick – early voting – the GOP is showing notable improvement in key battleground states.  <paragraph>   According to data compiled by the   <hyperlink> United States Election Project and POLITICO, in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina, Republicans are running several points ahead of their 2008 pace, while Democrats are running several points behind, in percentage of early votes cast.  <paragraph>   Those five are the only swing states that have party registration or offer the statistical breakdowns that enable the comparison.  <paragraph>   In Colorado, Republicans have cast 38 percent of the early vote to 35 percent for Democrats and 27 percent for unaffiliated voters. Four years ago, the numbers were reversed: Democrats cast 38 percent, Republicans 36 percent and independents 26 percent.  <paragraph>   In Iowa, 43 percent of the early vote this year has been cast by Democrats, 32 percent by Republicans and 24 percent by no party or other. In 2008, the numbers were 47 (D) 29 (R) 24 (NP).  <paragraph>   While Nevada doesn’t provide comparative statewide early vote data between 2008 and 2012, a similar pattern emerges in the two counties where the bulk of the state vote will be cast – the Democratic percentage of early votes is down slightly and there’s an uptick in the GOP percentage.  <paragraph>   In both Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno), Democrats continue to outpace Republicans, but by a diminished margin over 2008.  <paragraph>   Back then, Democrats held a 52 percent to 31 percent early vote advantage in Clark County. This year, the margin is 48-33. In Washoe, it was 47-35 in 2008 and it’s 41-40 this year.  <paragraph>   It’s a mistake to draw too many conclusions from the swing state early vote numbers – early voting isn’t over yet and there are too many state-specific variables to make broad conclusions about what it all means.  <paragraph>   But, if nothing else, the early vote suggests that in the states where it matters most, GOP turnout efforts are better organized and operating at a higher level than four years ago. And that matters a great deal in an election that figures to be exceptionally close.
11/6/12 8:40 AM EST | Van Hollen's mixed message |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   It's not uncommon to tailor campaign mailers to specific audiences, but when the messages are this contradictory they tend to stand out — particularly when the Maryland Democratic Party sends them to the same household.  <paragraph>   In this case, the Rep. Chris Van Hollen-as-Paul Ryan's-worst-nightmare piece was sent to the registered Democrat in the house while the more conciliatory 'what divides us' piece was directed to the registered independent.  <paragraph>   It would have been hard to overlook the difference between the red meat mailer and the kinder, gentler piece in any congressional district, but it's especially glaring in Van Hollen's suburban Maryland district, where a high percentage of his constituents work in government or the business of politics.  <paragraph>   In any case, Van Hollen is expected to cruise to an easy victory in his solidly Democratic district.
11/4/12 12:08 PM EST | How Pennsylvania will be won |   <paragraph>   Maybe Pennsylvania is a GOP mirage, maybe it’s not.  <paragraph>   But if Mitt Romney is going to win the state, the victory will be powered by his performance in the Philadelphia suburbs, which is why he’ll appear at a suburban Bucks County event Sunday.  <paragraph>   For decades, the big four suburban counties -- Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery – were the engine of GOP statewide victories. But all of them began to drift out of the GOP orbit in the 1990s and they’ve been a big reason why a Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won the state since 1988.  <paragraph>   Without them, it’s nearly impossible for Republicans to counterbalance the big Democratic margins coming out of the city of Philadelphia.  <paragraph>   In 2008, when the suburbs cast 22 percent of the statewide vote, Obama won 57 percent in the four counties. For much of this year, he seemed poised to win them again: A late September Franklin & Marshall College poll had Obama leading 54-36 in the four counties, a lead that he had held for months.  <paragraph>   When Franklin & Marshall polled the state again in late October, however Romney had pulled ahead, 47-45. Whether or not Obama truly cratered in the Philly burbs as the F&M poll suggested, other polls – Susquehanna, internal polling for House candidates – also found that Romney was closing in the collar counties.  <paragraph>   Still, a narrow win in the suburbs of southeastern Pennsylvania probably won’t be enough to put Romney over the top.  <paragraph>   There's every sign he'll perform well in western Pennsylvania outside of Pittsburgh, but he’ll also need to run up the score in the section known as the Republican “T” -- the central part of the state and its northern tier of counties. And Romney will need to be far more competitive than John McCain was in the Lehigh Valley.  <paragraph>   Pennsylvania is an uphill climb for the GOP ticket, but it’s possible. Not without a foothold in the Philadelphia suburbs, though.
11/3/12 5:22 PM EST | Barone: Romney wins, handily |   <paragraph>   Michael Barone, a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner and co-author of the Almanac of American Politics,  <hyperlink> goes out on a limb and predicts victory for Mitt Romney – by a margin of nearly 100 electoral votes.  <paragraph>     <quotation>   <paragraph>   In Barone’s estimation, Romney essentially sweeps the swing states, with the exception of Nevada, and even picks up Pennsylvania.  <paragraph>   Michael’s views have drifted rightward over the years and he's become a prominent conservative voice, so there will be a tendency among Democrats to dismiss his prediction. But having worked closely with him in the past — we worked together to produce three Almanacs – I'd argue that no one in the business has a greater command of the American political landscape than Barone.  <paragraph>   Even so, I don’t see his sweep scenario playing out.  <paragraph>   It’s not as implausible as it seems given the tightness of the battleground state map, but it’s contingent on the notion that most pollsters are fundamentally misreading the composition of the electorate -- I'm not there yet. His Ohio and New Hampshire arguments also feel a little unconvincing to me. And my sense is that Pennsylvania and Michigan will move in tandem – probably for Obama, but together in any case.
11/5/12 9:08 PM EST  | PPP: Obama leads everywhere |   <paragraph>   The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling has come in for a great deal of criticism this year, mainly from Republicans questioning its motives and methodology.  <paragraph>   The prolific pollster regularly produces quality work, but its Democratic affiliations and occasionally suspect practices [  <hyperlink> here and   <hyperlink> here] have led Republicans to dismiss its findings in the same manner that Democrats dismiss Rasmussen polls as biased toward the GOP.  <paragraph>   Now, almost on cue, PPP has delivered a final series of state polls that puts President Barack Obama in the lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reports a 49-49 tie.  <paragraph>   Against the backdrop of a highly competitive election, the uniformity of those results — and the fact that PPP shows 5- to 6-point spreads in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — puts the firm out on a ledge. So when the final state outcomes are known, PPP figures to be one of the election’s biggest winners or losers, poised either to spike the football — or to explain what went wrong.
11/2/12 6:24 PM EDT | Swing state nailbiters |  <paragraph>   President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are within 2 percentage points of each other in 6 swing states, according to Friday’s RealClearPolitics state polling averages.  <paragraph>   In three of those battleground states – Colorado, Florida and Virginia -- the race is within a single percentage point. The spread in Iowa, New Hampshire and Ohio is between 2.0 and 2.4 points.  <paragraph>   The biggest swing state gap is in Wisconsin, where Obama has a 5 point edge.  <paragraph>   Michigan and Pennsylvania, two states where the level of competitiveness is disputed by Democrats, both host tighter races than Wisconsin, according to RCP.  <paragraph>   In Pennsylvania, where Romney will campaign Sunday and his running mate Paul Ryan will stump on Saturday, the difference is 4.6 points. In Michigan, the spread is 3.5 points.
11/21/12 11:51 AM EST | Allen West's cautionary tale |  <paragraph>   If you’re wondering how a member of Congress could raise more than $17 million for his reelection bid and still lose, read Alex Isenstadt’s     <hyperlink>    excellent post-mortem on GOP Rep. Allen West’s defeat.    <paragraph>   Alex reports that West had sky-high name ID, a Republican-leaning district, an inexperienced 29-year-old Democratic foe and an election eve lead in his internal polling but still fell short in the end.    <paragraph>   It’s a cautionary tale, not for the average House member but for political provocateurs like West. In his case, he learned the hard way that the iron laws of politics apply even to congressmen with a national base of support.    <paragraph>   His outspoken and over-the-top style, it seems, was out of sync with the locals in his highly competitive district — and he didn’t dial it down in the face of a tough reelection race. Top of the ticket performance was also a problem since President Obama goosed Democratic turnout in his south Florida seat.    <paragraph>   West’s Republican colleagues in Tallahassee didn’t exactly have his back, either. As a relative newcomer to politics, and with his eye fixed on Washington, West lacked relationships in the GOP-controlled state capital that might have resulted in a safer district from redistricting.    <paragraph>   It’s unlikely that we’ve heard the last of West, however. As Alex notes, cable news will still find him an attractive guest. And with his national following and proven fundraising talent — he raised at least $23 million in his two congressional races, a stunning amount for a House candidate — he would be a competitive candidate for any office he sought.    <paragraph>   There’s even a comeback model for lightning-rod pols like West.    <paragraph>   Just a few hours up the road, Democrat Alan Grayson returned to Congress this year after suffering a fate similar to West in 2010. Like West, Grayson’s brand of combative and outspoken liberalism was a mismatch for his more temperate Orlando district.    <paragraph>   But with his prolific fundraising and base of support he was able to jump on his first opportunity to return to Congress, when a new, heavily Democratic seat opened after redistricting. No one bothered to challenge him in the Democratic primary and Grayson won in a November cakewalk.
10/30/12 7:22 PM EDT | Richard Mourdock, party buzzkill |         <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   In what’s shaping up to a good Republican year in Indiana — Mitt Romney is likely to carry the state, Mike Pence is likely to win the governorship and both legislative chambers figure to remain in GOP control — GOP Senate nominee Richard Mourdock’s candidacy has turned out to be a discordant note.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    The Evansville Courier & Press reports on a marked difference in the reactions to the top of the ticket nominees at the Indiana GOP fall dinner Monday.  <paragraph>       <quotation>       <paragraph>   Fortunately for Mourdock, top Indiana Republicans haven’t abandoned his candidacy — in part because of what they see as the over-the-top ferocity of the ensuing Democratic attacks against him.    <paragraph>   If he manages to pull out a victory, he’ll still have some serious fence-mending to do if he hopes to be effective in the Senate. Even if Mourdock had never made his comments about pregnancies caused by rape, it would have taken some time for him to win over Republicans who still nurse grievances left from his primary victory over veteran Sen. Dick Lugar. On top of that, he would arrive in Washington far more politically radioactive than the typical freshman senator.
10/30/12 3:45 PM EDT | Hurricane Sandy: The political fallout |       <paragraph>     <picture>  <paragraph>   The widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy is going to have an effect on Election Day. The only question is how far-reaching it’s going to be. While some states escaped with far less damage than they feared, as many as 8.5 million residents across the Northeast were without power Tuesday — and a portion of them faced the prospect of an extended period of time without electricity.    <paragraph>   Here are six things to watch in assessing the storm’s political fallout:    <paragraph>   The popular vote The storm’s path along the Eastern Seaboard ripped across a wide swath of blue state America. The list of hardest hit states includes many of the states expected to deliver the biggest victory margins for the president this year — among them New York, which delivered a 2 million vote winning margin to President Obama in 2008.    <paragraph>   While the extent to which elections will be disrupted next week is unclear, the extensive power outages, flooding and wreckage from North Carolina to Maine are certain to have an impact on campaign ground games and could work to depress voter turnout in some places.    <paragraph>   That shouldn’t affect the electoral vote — New York, for example, will still deliver its 29 electoral votes to Barack Obama regardless of the damage to lower Manhattan — but in an exceptionally tight election, lower turnout in the most Democratic states increases the odds of a scenario where Obama wins the Electoral College but loses the popular vote.    <paragraph>   The Senate map The storm’s path cut through a handful of states with some of this year’s closest Senate races — among them Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia.    <paragraph>   While the Connecticut and Virginia races are open seat contests, Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown and Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey are running for reelection. As their home states begin the process of recovery, both incumbents have unique opportunities for free media and to connect with constituents — in an official capacity — at a time when many will be in need of local and federal assistance.    <paragraph>   The House map New York, which has suffered the highest death toll and where 2.3 million households were without power Tuesday, is one the prime House battlegrounds this year. There are as many as eight competitive races, most of them located south of Albany, where the bulk of the power outages have occurred.    <paragraph>   In New Hampshire, where the state’s two Republican incumbents are in danger of losing their seats, the state remains under a flood watch. But the Union Leader reported that     <quotation>       <paragraph>   The 2016ers Any number of the nation’s governors (or mayors) can attest to the leadership challenges of natural disasters and the powerful effect they can have on approval ratings — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is among those who experienced a post-hurricane spike in popularity after Hurricane Irene.    <paragraph>   The path of Hurricane Sandy means it will test a handful of governors with prospects beyond their home states — Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.    <paragraph>   With the nation watching, how they respond will go a long way toward establishing their home state narrative. But it will also provide a first impression to many voters outside their states whose introduction to them comes solely through glimpses of interviews and press conferences on cable and broadcast news.    <paragraph>   Maine’s electoral vote Maine is one of two states (the other is Nebraska) that allocates its electoral votes by congressional district. While the statewide vote is firmly in the Obama camp, local Republicans believe one of its two congressional districts is within Mitt Romney’s reach — raising the possibility that the GOP nominee could capture one of the state’s four electoral votes.     <paragraph>   It’s a longshot, for sure. But it’s worth noting that the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future recently reserved a significant amount of airtime in Maine television markets. While much of that was in the Portland market — and thus designed to bleed into New Hampshire — the buy also covered the northern-based 2nd District, which is where the GOP sees its opportunity.     <paragraph>   As a whole, the state was largely spared the worst of the storm’s damage. But the aftereffects of the storm were not evenly distributed — at least 60,000 customers were without power Tuesday afternoon, the bulk of them in the Portland area, not in the expansive 2nd District. It could very well mean nothing. But anything that could alter the equation in Maine in the final week of the campaign is worth keeping an eye on.     <paragraph>   A leadership test for incumbents If we’ve learned anything about the politics of natural disasters, it’s that careers can be made and unmade in the preparations and aftermath.    <paragraph>   Snowstorms, hurricanes, flooding, wildfires — they offer rare, unfiltered opportunities for elected officials to prove their mettle under pressure, and at a time of great need.    <paragraph>   The experiences of the Bush family alone sketch out the range of political consequences.    <paragraph>   In August 1992, FEMA’s disjointed response to the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew took its toll on President George H.W. Bush’s standing in Florida, which he managed to carry narrowly that fall but by a dramatically reduced margin over 1988. After three consecutive blowout GOP presidential wins there, Bush scraped to victory by just 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 39 percent — a 20-point GOP drop since 1988.    <paragraph>   His son Jeb Bush, the former two-term Florida governor, learned from the experience. His own hurricane preparation and relief efforts — 8 major storms hit the state in 2004 and 2005 — helped burnish his own reputation as a chief executive and bolster his popularity.    <paragraph>   Jeb Bush’s brother, President George W. Bush, failed to hit the same high mark as president. While his own Florida hurricane response efforts in 2004 were well received, his presidency never recovered from the administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
10/28/12 7:51 PM EDT | Register endorsement arrives late |  <paragraph>   As one of the great papers in presidential politics — and one of     <hyperlink>    four major Iowa newspapers to endorse Mitt Romney on Sunday — it's understandable that the Des Moines Register's endorsement would cause a     <hyperlink>    stir this weekend.   <paragraph>   But the impact of the paper’s decision, in terms of persuading voters, is likely limited. <paragraph>   It's not that the Register's endorsement doesn't matter. Rather, roughly a quarter of the state’s vote has already been cast.    <paragraph>   According to figures     <hyperlink>    released Friday by the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, 423,586 absentee votes have already been received. That represents 27 percent of the total votes cast in 2008.   <paragraph>   The late-in-the-campaign endorsements in Iowa and elsewhere suggest that many newspapers haven’t yet accounted for the dramatic growth in the percentage of early voting across the nation. In some states, for example, more than one-third of the vote has already been cast.  <paragraph>   The United States Election Project     <hyperlink>    estimates that, through Sunday, 13.8 million ballots have been cast in all reporting jurisdiction — roughly 10 percent of the total votes cast in the 2008 presidential election.
10/27/12 12:27 PM EDT | Fla. insiders: Romney will win state  |    <paragraph>   Florida’s top politicos believe by an overwhelming margin that Mitt Romney will carry the state on Election Day.    <paragraph>   According to the latest     <hyperlink>    Tampa Bay Times survey of 120 of Florida’s top political insiders, 73 percent expect Romney will win Florida, compared to just 27 percent who think President Barack Obama will win the state a second time.    <paragraph>   The list of 120 insiders – consultants, lobbyists, fundraisers, political scientists, etc. -- is a little top heavy with Republicans: it’s made up of 65 Republicans, 48 Democrats and 7 independents or minor party types.    <paragraph>   But even among Democrats, 60 percent think Romney will carry Florida. Republicans are more certain: 95 percent believe Romney will win the state’s 29 electoral votes.    <paragraph>   While much of the October polling validates the notion that Romney has the edge in the nation’s largest swing state, all signs point to a very tight finish. At the moment, the RealClearPolitics polling average spread between the candidates is 1.8 percentage points.
10/26/12 3:10 PM EDT | NRCC still spending in Rhode Island. Really. |     <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Here’s a headline you don’t expect to see in heavily Democratic Rhode Island, 11 days out from Election Day:    <quotation>      <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    Ted Nesi’s report for WPRI:    <quotation>       <paragraph>   Given the state and the district’s Democratic orientation, the national GOP has typically checked out of Little Rhody by this time of year — if they paid attention at all. But the NRCC’s financial commitment at this late stage is a sign that Cicilline is an incumbent who remains in the danger zone.    <paragraph>   Cicilline, a freshman whose first term has been dogged by controversy surrounding statements he made about the fiscal health of Providence before he left the mayor’s office for Washington, is one of two New England Democrats facing uphill reelection challenges this year — the other is Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney.    <paragraph>   Suffice it to say, if Democrats aren’t able to hold House seats in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in a presidential election year, then there isn’t much hope of capturing a majority.    <paragraph>   UPDATE: Not to be outdone, the DCCC is     <hyperlink>    countering with a $315,000 ad buy for Cicilline, <quotation>
10/23/12 2:15 PM EDT | Reid: A one-man Romney wrecking crew |  <paragraph>   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid returned to his highly stylized Mitt Romney-bashing Monday in Nevada.  <paragraph>   While Reid’s attacks on Romney have been an ongoing pursuit, the stinging, personal nature of the criticism continues to stand out. Much of it is specific to Romney’s character — among other things, Reid has questioned the GOP nominee’s faith and insinuated he’s a tax cheat. It’s a level of disparagement that reaches beyond standard partisan character attacks, marked by especially blunt rhetoric for a Senate majority leader.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    the Las Vegas Sun report:    <quotation>    <paragraph>   Reid and Romney’s shared Mormon faith makes the Nevada senator's scorched-earth approach all the more fascinating. At a time that’s being called "the Mormon moment" because of the historic nature of Romney’s candidacy — he’s the first Mormon major party nominee — and at a time when the former Massachusetts governor has overwhelming support among fellow members of the LDS Church, the nation’s other top Mormon in public life ranks as one of Romney’s harshest detractors.    <paragraph>   One byproduct of the strained relationship is that it expresses the spectrum of LDS political thinking to a nation that’s unfamiliar with it. But it also raises questions about     <hyperlink>    what kind of relationship the two could ever hope to have if Romney were to be elected president.
10/20/12 3:29 PM EDT | Dems hold smaller Nevada edge than '08 |    <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Democrats will go into Election Day with a 90,000 voter registration advantage in Nevada, a smaller edge than in 2008 when Barack Obama carried the state.    <paragraph>   At the     <hyperlink>    close of voter registration this week in the Mountain West swing state, there were 526,986 Democrats and 436,799 Republicans — a difference of 90,187 active voters.    <paragraph>   In 2008, at the close of registration, Democrats held a statewide advantage of 100,723 voters.    <paragraph>   While the statewide gap between the parties has closed slightly since 2008 — a year when Democratic registration surged in Nevada and Obama carried the state by 121,000 votes — the real growth was among independents. The number of nonpartisan registrations across the state grew by 36,000 since 2008.    <paragraph>   That spike in independents is a prominent feature of the 2012 swing state map.    <paragraph>   According to     <hyperlink>    an August report from the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina posted double-digit percentage gains in the number of independent voters since the last presidential election.
10/18/12 10:56 AM EDT | Rendell: Casey hasn't run a campaign |   <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   As Democrats nervously eye the narrowing polls in Pennsylvania’s Senate race, reliably off-message former Gov. Ed Rendell offers a frank assessment of why Republican Tom Smith has closed the gap with Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr.    <paragraph>   From the     <hyperlink>    Times-Tribune in Scranton:    <quotation>       <paragraph>   The race, which hasn’t been viewed as a top-tier contest, has undoubtedly gotten closer in the homestretch as Smith has poured millions into TV spots hammering the first-term incumbent. While Casey has led in every public poll taken this year — and at least two recent polls give him a double-digit edge — a handful of other surveys over the past two weeks put his advantage at 4 points or less.    <paragraph>   The Casey camp surely won’t appreciate Rendell’s analysis — delivered to the senator’s hometown paper — but it’s not surprising, given the long history the two pols share.    <paragraph>   Casey’s father defeated Rendell in the 1986 Democratic primary for governor; in 2002, Rendell returned to defeat the junior Casey in a bitter Democratic gubernatorial primary.    <paragraph>   By 2006, the two Democrats had established a working relationship: Rendell backed Casey in the 2006 Senate race. But two years later, they were on opposite sides again as Casey backed Barack Obama in the presidential primary and Rendell emerged as one of Hillary Clinton’s strongest supporters. <paragraph>   UPDATE: It's worth noting that, despite the criticism, Rendell still thinks Casey will win — and run ahead of the president.    <quotation>    it's almost impossible for Smith to win.    <quotation>   Rendell said in the same interview.    <quotation> 
10/17/12 9:55 AM EDT | The final days of Laura Richardson |     <paragraph>       <picture>  <paragraph>   The House election homestretch always seems to feature one member of Congress who essentially gives up before Election Day, and this cycle that member appears to be California Democratic Rep. Laura Richardson.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    POLITICO’s Jessica Meyers:    <quotation>       <paragraph>   By raising just $7,000 in the latest quarter — a paltry sum for a member of Congress, let alone one who is engaged in a tough  incumbent vs. incumbent matchup — Richardson appears to have concluded some time ago that there’s no viable path to reelection.    <paragraph>   The congresswoman finished 20 percentage points behind Hahn in California's June "top-two" primary, a disheartening sign since they were the only two candidates running. The result offered little hope that Richardson could close the gap by November.    <paragraph>   Redistricting-related changes to her seat and the congresswoman’s ethics issues were hard enough to overcome, but without any cash — Richardson had just $68,000 cash on hand at the end of September — it’s nearly impossible.
