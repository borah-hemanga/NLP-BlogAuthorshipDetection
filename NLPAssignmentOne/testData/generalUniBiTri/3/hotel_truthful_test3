10/23/12 5:04 PM EDT | A narrow Obama win or a Romney landslide | <paragraph> Mika, Willie and I have spent the past few weeks answering the same question from viewers, family members and friends. "Who's going to win the election??" <paragraph> After the first debate, that question was asked in the form of a plea from Democrats. Before that, Republicans grimly asked for their prognosis, resigned to the fact that the answer would not be satisfying. <paragraph> I spent most of the year telling those who asked that the dynamics of the race suggested a narrow Barack Obama win. But that all changed after the president's Denver debacle. After that meltdown, I am the first to admit I have no idea how this will turn out. <paragraph> But I do know this: Mitt Romney will win the presidency if he wins Ohio. That's because the Republican candidate is nailing down the Southern swing states that he has to win. With Florida, North Carolina and Virginia moving his way, the battle now moves to the Midwest. <paragraph> If Romney's momentum is strong enough to erase the 10-point deficit he once faced in Ohio, expect him to carry other swing states like Nevada and Colorado. <paragraph> That scenario would have been far more plausible had Mr. Romney turned in a stronger performance at last night's debate in Florida. As things stand today, Ohio is still a heavy lift for the GOP candidate and that means President Obama should still be considered a slight favorite to win reelection. <paragraph> But my gut tells me there are two likely scenarios: (1) President Obama will squeak out a narrow Electoral College victory or (2) Mitt Romney will carry Ohio and be swept into office by a comfortable margin. <paragraph> After practicing politics for 20 years, I suppose I would rather be in Mitt Romney's shoes than Barack Obama's. Incumbents who are under 50 percent two weeks out usually go down to defeat. <paragraph> But who knows? Maybe Barack Obama will bend history once again.
6/2/12 12:55 PM EDT | The next great depression? |   <paragraph>  If the world slides into a global depression over the next year, consider yourself forewarned by the Wall Street Journal. Yesterday's edition was packed with so many grim headlines that one could be forgiven for believing that we could be seeing cash-filled wheelbarrows by the end of the summer.  <paragraph>  In what could have been called the Black Friday issue, the Journal reported on: - an Asian slowdown brought on by European woes - India's economy sputtering to a nine-year low - a continued economic slowdown in China - weakness coming out of South Korea and Australia - a growing banking crisis in Spain - a deepening of Greece's economic collapse - increased economic problems across Africa - the desperate plea of European bankers for a unified rescue fund   <paragraph>  Yet another WSJ story reported that President Obama was aggressively weighing in on the European debt crisis, urging EU leaders to make tough choices to prevent the kind of crisis that propelled him into the White House four years ago. The Journal wrote of a growing concern in the White House that a similar crisis could be responsible for his defeat four years after the September 15th meltdown.  <paragraph>  Adding to the grimness of Friday's morning edition was a jobs report that landed on Wall Street with a thud at 8:30 a.m.. Yesterday's depressing jobs report was terrible news for the president and the millions of Americans who are still struggling to find a job.  <paragraph>  The economic data released this week was not much better for some of the U.S.'s top employers.  <paragraph>  The screaming headline "Business Braces for Europe's Worst" was splashed across the top of the Journal's Marketplace section. Companies like McDonald's, Carnival and Goodrich are sure to see their earnings hit hard by a sagging European economy.  <paragraph>  That is bad news for U.S. workers and for a president who has five months left to prove that his policies have reversed an economic slide that he inherited in 2008. Chicago's argument keeps getting tougher to make every month, with the backdrop of an economy that seems to be growing weaker by the day.
5/21/12 9:25 PM EDT  | Chicago books mayor for telling truth |  <paragraph>  Only Nixon could go to China, only Clinton could pass welfare reform and only Cory Booker could draw blood by  <hyperlink>  calling out Barack Obama. <paragraph>  That's because Republicans have called President Obama every name in the book over the past four years --from Marxist to fascist to racist. During that time, the right-wing noise machine spewed out such a steady stream of insults toward Mr. Obama that most swing voters simply don't pay attention to those howlers who keep crying wolf.  <paragraph>  Enter <quotation>   Cory Booker.  <paragraph>  The formerly fast-rising Democratic star and Obama surrogate went on "Meet the Press" Sunday morning to blast his candidate's populist attacks on venture capitalism. In so doing, the Newark mayor committed a terrible gaffe by Washington standards.  <paragraph>  He told the truth.  <paragraph>  Now he will surely pay a steep political price for his honesty. Never mind the fact that many of the big money contributors who made Barack Obama's historic election possible four years ago continue to practice the same brand of capitalism that made Mitt Romney rich. And many of those contributors are being asked once again to support Barack Obama's campaign.  <paragraph>  Cory Booker may have been forced to  <hyperlink> produce a hostage video last night, but it is Barack Obama who remains handcuffed today to the same big money capitalists that he still blames for ruining America.
5/1/12 9:26 PM EDT | Politics and the endless war |  <paragraph>  The president's prime-time address tonight put a bow on the political gift Osama bin Laden's death provided Team Obama.  <paragraph>  Did the White House politicize the terror chief's death? Of course. Is it breaking news that an administration would do such a thing? Of course not.  <paragraph>  In 1960, John Kennedy created a missile gap with the Soviets out of thin air to defeat Richard Nixon.  <paragraph>  Four years later, LBJ shamelessly used his "Daisy" ad to suggest that a Goldwater administration would cause a nuclear war.  <paragraph>  In 1968, Richard Nixon lied about a secret plan to get out of Vietnam.  <paragraph>  In 2002, Karl Rove and the GOP used September 11th as a wedge issue against Democratic candidates.  <paragraph>  And in 2012, President Obama is using the killing of Osama bin Laden as a political tool.  <paragraph>  If you are shocked by such things, get over it. Be more concerned  with the president's declaration that U.S. troops will be in Afghanistan until 2024. That reality means Americans who were not even born on Sept. 11, 2001, will be occupying Afghanistan 20 years after those attacks. Never mind that the epicenter of Al Qaeda's operation has moved to Yemen or that U.S. taxpayers are doling out $2 billion a week on a war whose main purpose is propping up one of the most corrupt regimes on the face of the Earth.  <paragraph>  Making matters worse is the fact that Mr. Obama's opponents in the GOP want to stay longer. <paragraph>  The takeaway of President Obama's speech tonight is simple. The neocons won, the troops lost and the endless war grinds on in a land that humbled the Soviet Union, the British Empire and Alexander the Great. Good luck with that, Mr. President.
4/9/12 5:50 PM EDT | Economic help for Obama |   <paragraph>  The Wall Street Journal editorial page usually has little good to say about <hyperlink>  President Obama's economic agenda. But today's Journal was brimming with good news for a White House facing reelection during tough economic times. From front to back, the WSJ was filled with upbeat  <hyperlink>   economic news. Considering Friday's disappointing jobs numbers, the good news must have been a welcome respite for the White House.  <paragraph>  The paper's lead article showcased a study declaring that U.S. companies were emerging stronger from the Great Recession than they were even before the 2008 financial meltdown. The Journal quoted Wells Fargo's former chief economist who said the last few years have made U.S. companies  <quotation>  That positive sentiment was backed by a WSJ analysis that showed sales, profits and employment higher among the Standard and Poor's companies than in 2007.  <paragraph>  That front page story was coupled with hopeful headlines from the Journal's opinion pages. Historian Walter Russell Mead's op-ed "The Myth of America's Decline" argued that, while power has become dispersed among more global players (  <hyperlink>  China, India,  <hyperlink>  Brazil, Turkey, Japan and Europe), the United States remains the "Chairman of the Board" on most global matters.  <paragraph>  Next to Mead's article was an opinion page headline asking  <quotation>  Even though the article warns of a coming fiscal cliff in 2013, most incumbents would put this op-ed under the "Just-Spell-My-Name-Right" category.  <paragraph>  If opinion writers spend the next year haggling over who should get the credit for America's improving economy, Barack Obama will be a happy man and Republicans will start planning for 2014.
3/26/12 1:38 PM EDT | Not conservative enough |   <paragraph>  In the  <hyperlink>  New York Times this Sunday, author Kevin Baker echoed the sentiment of most in the mainstream media that the Republican Party's biggest problem over the past few years has been a lurch to the right. When you judge the party by its bottom line, the fact is that the GOP has not been conservative enough.  <paragraph>  What is too conservative about spending the past decade doubling the national debt?   <paragraph>  How is an unpaid for $7 trillion Medicare expansion a run to the right?  <paragraph>  Will most historians look back on a party who promised to end tyranny across the globe, use American troops as the world's 9-1-1 and engage in nation building on an unprecedented level consider Bush Republicans too conservative or too Wilsonian? Don't waste your time answering. The verdict is obvious. <paragraph>  And for all the weeping and gnashing of teeth I have had to endure over the radicalism of this tea party Congress, to my worried liberal friends I say “take a valium and relax.” This right wing, radical, reactionary tea party crew has meekly gone along with their statist party leaders far too often for my tastes. As a result, they added $1 trillion to the national debt their first year in power and got outmaneuvered by President Barack Obama at every turn.  <paragraph>  Too many in the media (and the conservative movement) have been distracted by stupid statements that have been streaming out of a few Republicans' mouths instead of keeping their eyes on the bottom line. When you focus on the one issue that really matters -- individual freedom vs. state expansion -- the GOP fails every test on true, blue conservatism.   <paragraph>  And now the party is in the process of nominating the man who was the architect of Obama's health care law.   <paragraph>  Too conservative? Actually, not conservative enough.   <paragraph>  ( <video> See my video blog below on the topic)
2/14/12 7:00 PM EST | The truth about entitlement spending | <paragraph>   If you want to know why Republicans and Democrats can't make progress on long-term deficit reduction, take a look at the segment below from Morning Joe. In our roundtable discussion, my good friend Jeffrey Sachs (I need to underline that point before you actually watch the segment) claims that entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not cause the national debt to balloon over the next generation.   <paragraph>   Despite my great respect for Dr. Sachs, the Columbia professor's math doesn't seem to add up. <paragraph>   Financier and former Obama Car Czar Steve Rattner came to play today with handy charts that show entitlement spending devouring 40% of federal spending in 2012. Within the decade, that number expands to 54%, and goes much higher in the out years. Steve also described a crowding out of federal investment in discretionary programs like education, R&D and infrastructure because of an ever-growing entitlement system fueled by an aging population and rising health care costs.  <paragraph>   Dr. Sachs did admit that entitlement spending was on a sharp upward trajectory but was unwilling to embrace the type of reforms that I believe will prevent the collapse of Medicare in the future.  <paragraph>   But progressives are not alone in their collective state of denial regarding Medicare. In one of the most depressing poll results registered over the past few years, self-described Tea Party members were surveyed last spring     <hyperlink>    in a Marist poll and asked if they supported Medicare spending reforms. A pathetic 70% said     <quotation>    proving once again that when it comes to entitlement programs, some Americans just don't want to hear the truth.   <paragraph>   But the truth is that Medicare and Medicaid are the biggest drivers of America's national debt over the next generation. And that is not a matter of ideology. That is a matter of math. <video> 
2/13/12 1:07 AM EST | My new POLITICO blog, all I ever needed | <paragraph>   Thanks so much for taking a look at my Politico blog. <paragraph>   Like Navin R. Johnson seeing his name in the phone book for the first time, I feel like this is the lucky break I've been waiting for all my life. My blog will delight you and your extended family with stories of European futbol matches that end in 0-0 ties, underground bands for whom neither you nor your friends have ever heard, and inspiring stories regaling the glories of my time in Congress 47 years ago.   <paragraph>   I will also do my best to let you know what's really happening behind the scenes in Congress, the White House and in the media world. I'll also write about the things that really matter the most to me -- like my ashtray, and these matches, and the remote control, and the paddle ball... and this lamp. That's all I need, is this lamp....and this blog.   <paragraph>   Best, Joe
