11/19/12 7:37 PM EST  | The war on Charlie Crist |   <paragraph>   <picture>  <paragraph>  As former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist looks more and more like a Democratic prospect for governor in 2014, the Florida GOP is ramping up its efforts to damage his political brand:  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  Tthe Associated Press:  <quotation>    <paragraph>  It’s hard to overstate the level of disdain many Florida Republicans have for Crist, so in one sense, the Crist-bashing isn’t a surprise.  <paragraph>  But there’s some risk in an over-the-top approach — the more the GOP attacks Crist, who hasn’t even registered as a Democrat yet, the more he could look like a sympathetic character to his prospective party.  <paragraph>  The track record for recent high-profile party-switchers isn’t great: Former Alabama Rep. Parker Griffith lost by a wide margin in a 2010 GOP primary following his switch from the Democratic Party, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was also rejected by his new party in a 2010 Democratic primary after he switched from the GOP side.  <paragraph>  There’s one big difference, though, between those party-switchers and Crist. Griffith and Specter both ran for reelection in the same election cycle that they switched parties, leaving them little time or opportunity to establish a trusting relationship with their new parties.  <paragraph>  Crist, on the other hand, will have plenty of distance from the Republican Party by 2014, and lots of time to do the necessary spadework with the Democratic grass-roots. By then, four years will have passed since he left the GOP. He’s already begun the process of generating political goodwill by supporting Democratic candidates and emerging as a prominent backer of President Obama — and by attracting the ire of the Florida GOP.
11/12/12 5:35 PM EST | Romney's Oakland County blues |   <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  The Detroit Free Press captures Republican hand-wringing after another presidential loss in Michigan’s Oakland County, a one-time GOP suburban stronghold that again eluded the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  Without the county, the state’s second-most populous after Detroit’s Wayne County, Mitt Romney had no chance of carrying the state where he was born.  <paragraph>   <quotation>   <paragraph>  Romney’s local connections make his 54-46 loss there an especially bitter pill to swallow — he grew up in Oakland County, and his father served as governor of Michigan.  <paragraph>  While he ran 4 points ahead of John McCain’s pace in 2008, the fact that a candidate as well-suited for the area as Romney couldn’t win there is a telling sign of how damaged the GOP brand is in many of the Midwestern and Northeastern suburbs.  <paragraph>  While exit polls report Romney carried the suburbs 50-48 overall, he still fell short in many of the populous suburban counties that reliably powered GOP victories for decades — places like Oakland County.
11/8/12 11:05 AM EST | 2010 losers get their revenge | <picture> <paragraph>  Tuesday was a banner day for Democrats seeking a return to the House after losing their seats in the 2010 GOP wave — and for ex-members of Congress in general.  <paragraph>  Nine former House members, consisting of seven Democrats and two Republicans, are returning for the 113th Congress.  <paragraph>  Six are Democrats who lost in 2010 — Bill Foster, Alan Grayson, Ann Kirkpatrick, Dan Maffei, Carol Shea-Porter and Dina Titus.  <paragraph>  In their case, it wasn’t a clear-cut case of voter remorse. Only Maffei and Shea-Porter knocked off the Republicans who defeated them in 2010.  <paragraph>  Foster, Grayson, Kirkpatrick and Titus all ran against different opponents and in seats altered by redistricting. Now they’ll have the awkward prospect of serving in the same delegation as the members who beat them two years ago.  <paragraph>  Grayson celebrated his victory with typical flair: He sent an email to supporters Wednesday calling his win the  <quotation>   a nod to his blowout 18-percentage-point loss in 2010, and even more lopsided 25-point victory Tuesday.  <paragraph>  Three other ex-members — Republicans Steve Stockman and Matt Salmon and Democrat Rick Nolan — have been out of Congress for more than a decade.  <paragraph>  Those three, who arrived in Congress as part of famed classes of congressional rookies, will return to an institution that will be close to unrecognizable. Nolan was part of the class of Watergate babies in 1974; he’ll take office as a 69-year-old freshman. Stockman and Salmon were part of the GOP class of 1994.  <paragraph>  Not everyone seeking a second tour of duty made it: Ohio Democrat Charlie Wilson, a 2010 loser, fell short in his rematch against GOP Rep. Bill Johnson.
11/6/12 2:42 PM EST | 25 key counties to watch tonight |   <paragraph>  <picture> AP Photo  <paragraph>  Forget about a national election. Forget about the swing states.  <paragraph>  The presidential election will be won and lost in a relatively narrow band of key counties within the swing states – some competitive, some partisan strongholds. That’s why Jefferson County, Colo., (pop. 540,000) matters more than the most populous county in the nation, Los Angeles County, Calif. (pop. 9.9 million). And why two Wisconsin counties — Dane (pop. 496,000) and Waukesha (pop. 391,000) — are more relevant to the presidential outcome this year than the behemoth to their south, Illinois' Cook County (pop. 5.2 million).  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink>  Also on POLITICO: Latest polls from across the U.S.)  <paragraph>  Here’s a list of 25 of the most important counties tonight across the swing state map.  Colorado  <paragraph>  Jefferson County Republicans have a registration advantage over Democrats in this Denver suburb, but there are almost as many unaffiliated voters as Republicans. It’s a reflection of a swing county that was once a GOP stronghold but in recent years has drifted leftward. While Jefferson went for George W. Bush in 2004, since then a stream of Democratic statewide candidates have carried the county, including Barack Obama, who won by 9 points there.  <paragraph>  Arapahoe County Another suburban Denver locale, Arapahoe often moves in tandem with Jefferson County — both were once solidly Republican, moved toward the center, voted narrowly for George W. Bush in 2004 and then gave Barack Obama even bigger margins in 2008.  <paragraph>  El Paso County Home to Colorado Springs, with its politically engaged evangelical community and heavy military influence, El Paso County is a conservative stronghold where Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 2-to-1. Romney will need to turn in a big number out of El Paso — now the state’s most populous county — to capture Colorado, and must outperform John McCain, who ran well below the county’s typical landslide GOP presidential margins.  Florida  <paragraph>  Duval County A reliable GOP performer over the years, Jacksonville’s Duval County nearly went for Obama in 2008 — in large part due to high African-American turnout. Republicans need a Romney result in the mid-to-high 50s to help balance out Democratic votes elsewhere in the state.  <paragraph>  Hillsborough County Tampa’s Hillsborough County is one of the nation’s top bellwethers: Since 1960, no presidential candidate has won Florida without carrying it.  <paragraph>  That’s why few places have gotten as much care and attention as Hillsborough this year. Not only have the candidates made several appearances, the GOP held its national convention in Tampa this summer. In 2008, both the McCain and Obama campaigns paid close attention to the county, but Obama won by 53 percent to 46 percent — the exact same margin that Bush won by in 2004.  <paragraph>  Miami-Dade County Obama needs to roll up the score in South Florida but particularly in Democratic Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county. Romney’s performance with Hispanic voters will be important in heavily Cuban-American Miami-Dade, where there are more than a quarter-million Hispanic Republicans.  <paragraph>  Orange County At the other end of the I-4 corridor from Tampa, Romney must improve on McCain’s dismal performance in Orlando’s Orange County, which wasn’t even close in 2008 after being decided by razor-thin margins in 2000 and 2004. But the growth of the non-Cuban Hispanic population in Orange County and neighboring Osceola County — most notably, the Democratic-voting Puerto Rican population — has altered the political equation over the past decade.  <paragraph>  South Florida — namely populous Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties — turned in big margins for Obama in 2008, which makes the I-4 corridor between Tampa and Orlando all the more important.  Iowa  <paragraph>  Dallas County A suburb of Des Moines, Dallas County is Iowa’s fastest-growing county. If Romney’s not winning in a place McCain won in 2008, he’s not going to win Iowa.  <paragraph>  Dubuque County Northeastern Iowa is the most heavily Roman Catholic part of the state. Obama won Democratic Dubuque County 60-39 in 2008, but Republicans expect Romney and running mate Paul Ryan to cut into Obama’s margins among Catholics as a result of tensions surrounding the federal mandate to cover contraceptive services in health plans.  <paragraph>  Johnson County A Democratic stronghold that’s home to Iowa City and the University of Iowa, the Obama campaign needs a big turnout in Johnson County to win roughly two-thirds of the vote.  <paragraph>  Polk County Polk County (Des Moines) is Iowa’s most populous by a wide margin; Democrats have a 39-31 percent registration advantage. Romney doesn’t have to win the county, but keeping Obama to the low 50s is imperative.  Nevada  <paragraph>  Clark County Democratic Clark County (Las Vegas), the state’s population hub, is where two-thirds of the Nevada vote was cast in 2008. There’s a significant Mormon population there, which should boost Romney, but the key for Republicans is holding down Obama’s victory margin.  <paragraph>  Washoe County The second-most populous county in the state and home to Reno, once-reliably Republican Washoe voted narrowly for Bush in 2004. Four years later, however, Obama carried it by 12 points. For Romney to win the state, he must win Washoe and Nevada’s rural counties to overcome Obama’s expected Clark County advantage.  New Hampshire  <paragraph>  Hillsborough County  If Mitt Romney is going to carry New Hampshire, he’s going to need Hillsborough, where more than a quarter of the state vote was cast in 2008. Its biggest cities are familiar datelines in presidential election years — Manchester and Nashua. This was a Bush county in 2000 and 2004 — narrowly — but Obama pulled out a 4-point win here in 2008. North Carolina  <paragraph>  Mecklenberg County Democrats held their national convention in Charlotte for a reason — this county, which has more voters than any other in the state, is critical to victory. In 2008, powered by strong African-American turnout, Obama crushed McCain in Mecklenberg by a stunning 62-37 margin — a full 10 percentage points above John Kerry’s 2004 performance.   <paragraph>  Wake County Though Bush carried it twice, Obama blew out the doors in 2008 in Democratic-trending Wake County: He won 57 percent among the affluent and educated Research Triangle electorate. It’s the state's second-most populous county after Charlotte's Mecklenburg County, so Romney must take a bit out of Obama’s 2008 margin to be competitive. Ohio  <paragraph>  Cuyahoga County If you could know the results of just one Ohio county on election night, Cuyahoga would be your choice. Home to Cleveland, the county is a Democratic stronghold where heavy turnout is essential to Democratic statewide hopes. Four years ago, Obama obliterated McCain there, 69-30, an impressive result even by the county’s standards.  <paragraph>  Franklin County Increasingly Democratic, Columbus’s Franklin County is Ohio’s second-largest population hub after Cuyahoga County. It voted narrowly for Al Gore (49-48), comfortably for Kerry (54-45) and then strongly for Obama (60-39).  <paragraph>  Hamilton County An explosion in African-American turnout in 2008 helped deliver Cincinnati’s Hamilton County to Obama, making him the first Democratic presidential nominee since LBJ to carry the population hub of southwest Ohio.  <paragraph>  Romney needs to win here to offset Democratic margins coming out of Cuyahoga County, a goal that’s within reach since both GOP Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rob Portman, a Cincinnati native and a key Romney surrogate, carried the county in 2010. Virginia  <paragraph>  Henrico County Like many other suburbs of the Eastern Seaboard, Henrico County is a one-time GOP stronghold that evolved over the years into a battleground.  <paragraph>  Over the past 12 years, it voted for George W. Bush twice, for former GOP Sen. George Allen in his unsuccessful 2006 reelection bid and for Republican Bob McDonnell for governor in 2009. But Henrico also voted for Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine for governor and for Barack Obama in 2008.  <paragraph>  African-American turnout here and in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News area is essential for an Obama victory.  <paragraph>  Prince William County Once reliably and strongly Republican, fast-growing, exurban Prince William County in Northern Virginia has become more competitive over the past decade as it’s grown more diverse.  Both 2008 presidential campaigns paid close attention to the county, but on Election Day, Obama won by a surprisingly strong 58-42 score. A Romney victory in Virginia likely begins with a solid showing here; since the Virginia polls close at 7 p.m., it will offer an early indicator of Romney’s suburban and exurban strength. Wisconsin  <paragraph>  Dane County Reliably liberal and the second most populous county after Milwaukee County, Madison’s Dane County is Wisconsin’s partisan counterbalance to GOP stronghold Waukesha County.  <paragraph>  Dane regularly delivers huge Democratic margins, so turnout here is important to the president’s chances of carrying the state for a second time — in 2008, Obama won Dane with 72 percent of the vote.  <paragraph>  Waukesha County If Romney isn’t winning two-thirds of the vote in this GOP bastion, he’s not winning Wisconsin. Like Gov. Scott Walker, who’s twice won more than 70 percent here, Romney needs to roll up big margins here in Wisconsin’s third-largest county, just west of Milwaukee. Without a strong Waukesha performance, it will be almost impossible to offset the Democratic margins coming out of Milwaukee and Dane counties. Michigan  <paragraph>  Oakland County Michigan is a longshot for Romney, to be sure. To have any chance of winning, he’ll need a strong performance in this historically Republican suburb of Detroit. Romney begins with at least one advantage: He grew up there, and his father served as the state’s governor.  <paragraph>  The state’s second-most populous county after Detroit’s Wayne County, Oakland has trended Democratic, but Romney is the kind of GOP nominee who could get traction in the white-collar suburbs here. Some recent polls have Romney winning Oakland and performing well in neighboring Macomb County, both of which are necessary elements of a Romney victory. Pennsylvania   <paragraph>  Bucks County If Obama’s winning here, chances are he’s also running well across the Philadelphia suburbs. With the big four suburban counties — Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery — in his pocket and an expected big Democratic margin out of Philadelphia, there’s almost no chance the president will lose the state.  <paragraph>  But Republicans are convinced they have an opportunity in the historically GOP-oriented Philly suburbs, which is why Romney appeared in Bucks County on Sunday, just two days before Election Day.
11/4/12 1:00 PM EST | Jerry Brown's last stand |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   When it comes to   <hyperlink> Proposition 30, the bold tax initiative pushed by California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, the stakes are high — and not just because of the policy implications.  <paragraph>   Dan Walters, a widely respected Sacramento Bee columnist,  <hyperlink> writes that the 74-year-old governor’s legacy hangs in the balance:   <quotation>  <paragraph>   The polls report that the outcome is very much up in the air, with support just shy of 50 percent, leading Walters to ask, in the event of a loss,   <quotation>  <paragraph>   There would be no shortage of Democratic talent if Brown declined to run again — Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has already said he will run if Brown doesn’t, and other prospective heavyweights include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Attorney General Kamala Harris.  <paragraph>   A serious primary challenge is also in the realm of possibility. The state’s new top-two primary system — where the top two finishers, regardless of party, move on to the general election — has reordered the state’s political calculus, and it’s not hard to envision scenarios in which it would make sense for an ambitious Democrat to take on a governor whose career in public office began more than four decades ago.
10/31/12 12:51 PM EDT | W.Va. GOP: Stop Obama, vote straight ticket |  <paragraph>   In a state where President Obama is deeply unpopular and unlikely even to crack 40 percent on Election Day, the West Virginia Republican Party is urging voters to punish Democrats up and down the ballot, not just the president, by voting a straight Republican ticket. <paragraph>   From a West Virginia GOP email today:   <quotation>   <paragraph>   West Virginia is one of a declining number of states — 15 in all — that enables straight ticket voting, which allows voters to select a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single punch or mark on the ballot.  <paragraph>   There’s no real pattern to the list of states that still permit the practice — they’re red and blue, big and small, and spread across the map. The beneficiaries of the practice aren’t entirely obvious either — it depends on the state.  <paragraph>   There’s some irony in the West Virginia GOP’s call for a straight ticket vote — for years, it’s worked to the benefit of local Democrats.  <paragraph>   Still, it’s probably safe to assume that if straight ticket voting is going to have a significant impact this year it’s going to be in states like West Virginia or Utah, where the presidential vote is likely to be lopsided.
10/27/12 1:43 PM EDT | Calif. props price tag: $351 million | <paragraph>   <picture>    <paragraph>   While there’s no action at the presidential level in California, where President Barack Obama is poised to win by a comfortable margin, the nation’s largest state is still weathering an avalanche of campaign spending.    <paragraph>   The main driver? The 11 statewide ballot propositions.    <paragraph>   A new     <hyperlink>    MapLight analysis of campaign finance data through Oct. 25 reports that $351 million has been raised by the campaigns for and against the ballot measures.    <paragraph>   The bulk of that staggering total is in just three propositions: two measures that raise taxes (Propositions 30 and 38) and Proposition 32, which would ban unions and corporations from using automatic paycheck deductions to raise money for political purposes.    <paragraph>   At least $128 million has been raised for Prop 32, powered by $68.8 million in pro-labor money.    <paragraph>   The MapLight research reveals some fascinating nuggets, including the extent to which just a few mega-donors and special interests are     <hyperlink>    bankrolling the measures. But what’s equally interesting about the totals is that they serve as a reminder of the exorbitant costs of campaigning in California.    <paragraph>   The state hasn’t been competitive at the presidential level for a quarter-century but if it was, given the price tag of competing there, it would have a dramatic effect on the business of running for president, forcing a wholesale rethinking of strategy, tactics and fundraising practices.
10/19/12 11:08 AM EDT | Gay marriage polling uncertain | <paragraph>   A new poll in Washington state shows a comfortable lead for R-74, a referendum that would approve same-sex marriage.    <paragraph>   Fifty-four percent of voters support the ballot measure, according to a     <hyperlink>    KCTS 9 Washington Poll released Thursday, compared with 38 percent who oppose it.    <paragraph>   Washington is one of four Democratic-oriented states that will be voting on same-sex marriage measures on Election Day — Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota are the others — and in each of them, polling suggests that November could provide a breakthrough victory on an issue that has never passed on a statewide ballot.    <paragraph>   In Maryland, for example,    <hyperlink>    a Washington Post poll released Thursday reported voters favor upholding the state’s gay marriage law, 52 percent to 43 percent.    <paragraph>   There’s just one problem. In the past, polling surrounding same-sex marriage measures has been highly unreliable — voters have not always been truthful with pollsters about their true voting preference.    <paragraph>   As a result, the University of Washington, which conducted the KCTS 9 poll, also offered adjusted data to account for     <quotation>   — the tendency of voters to misrepresent their true feelings on sensitive issues in an attempt to present themselves in a way that will seem favorable to others.    <paragraph>   With the adjusted vote estimate, the results were a lot closer — 53 percent in support of the measure and 47 percent in opposition.    <paragraph>   That’s a 9-point swing in opposition, a dramatically higher percentage than in the unadjusted results and one that should worry marriage equality advocates since the polling spread in Maine, Maryland and Minnesota is under 10 points.
