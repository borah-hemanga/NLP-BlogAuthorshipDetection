11/15/12 4:10 PM EST | Georgia GOPers fall short |  <paragraph>  The Georgia Tipsheet blog   <hyperlink>  notes that the House GOP leadership elections were a flop for Georgia, which saw two members of its delegation fall short. <paragraph>  Rep. Tom Price lost to Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Wednesday in his bid to become conference chairman while Rep. Tom Graves lost Thursday in his attempt to head the Republican Study Committee.  <paragraph>  While it’s a blow to Georgia interests, the outcomes are probably a net plus for the House GOP in the wake of an election that underscored the party’s weakness in competing with women and in regions outside the South.  <paragraph>  Had Price and Graves won the posts they vied for, top House leadership would have consisted of 5 white males, three of them from the South. The new team will now have one woman at the table, and will have more regional balance – two from the West (McMorris Rodgers and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California), a Midwesterner in Speaker John Boehner and two Southerners, Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and Republican Study Committee Chair Steve Scalise of Louisiana.  <paragraph>  Still, the GOP's congressional wing has a ways to go in presenting a different face to voters. As POLITICO's Manu Raju and Jake Sherman   <hyperlink>  report, the House and Senate GOP chose four women lawmakers out of 14 spots for senior leadership positions.
