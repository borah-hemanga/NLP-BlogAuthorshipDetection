4/3/12 7:29 PM EDT  | Let Mitt be Mitt... and dull |   <paragraph>  Mike Allen and Evan Thomas' "Inside the Circus" reveals that Mitt Romney's campaign team is still trying to figure out how to make their emotionally remote and fabulously wealthy candidate connect with voters.  <paragraph>  Team Romney has spent the past month or so trying to humanize their candidate with mostly disastrous results. Romney's poll numbers have taken a dive and his consistently poor performances have spooked conservatives like myself who can't believe this is the best the GOP has to offer after four years of Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Although he's a lousy politician, everyone who knows Mitt personally sees him as a great father, a devoted husband and a gifted businessman. If you spend a few minutes with the man's family, you can see his character shining through in his wife and five boys. But being a good man has not always translated well on the campaign trail. Perhaps this is because the business of politics is such an inhumane slog that only the craziest among us can look like normal human beings while going through the grind of a presidential election.  <paragraph>  Mitt can't fake it. He stinks at politicking. But then again, so did many others who would later succeed at governing. If Boston wants their candidate to humanize himself, maybe they should just let him admit that fact and stop trying to stuff himself into a suit that doesn't fit.  <paragraph>  So what should Mitt Romney tell Americans when he stops joking about his father shutting down plants or when he stops pretending to be a fan of "The Hunger Games"? Maybe he could start with the truth about himself.  <paragraph>  Mr. Romney should begin by talking about the proud legacy that his father passed along, the lessons he learned from a dad who began his life with little and ended up a legend in Michigan business and history.  <paragraph>  Then Mitt Romney should brag about starting a company that was wildly successful in turning businesses around, repairing failing companies and creating big profits for senior citizens, colleges, public unions, 401(k)s and anyone else smart enough to bet on Romney's company.  <paragraph>  Romney could then brag about leaving Wall Street to take on Teddy Kennedy in the Liberal Lion's own back yard. He should also admit to lurching a bit too much to the left while assuring conservatives that he will never make that mistake again.  <paragraph>  Team Romney should also remind voters that he saved the 2002 Olympics, not because he knew how to tell jokes or play  <quotation>  but because Mitt Romney was born to fix things that are broken - like the U.S. economy in 2012. <paragraph>  Romney should then tell Americans how he was elected governor of one of the most liberal states in America despite being a conservative Mormon. Romney further succeeded politically when he managed to pull the Democratic legislature of Massachusetts as far right as politically possible. If President Romney is forced one day to govern with Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid, he can promise Americans that he will be more prepared to lead a divided nation than a certain former state legislator who voted present on the same kind of tough votes that required Governor Romney to build a majority.  <paragraph>  Mitt Romney should then just admit the sad truth. He's stiff. He's boring. He looks plain uncomfortable every time he tries to be cool. And despite what the love of his life may believe, he has never been the life of any party. But he may be the only leader on the national stage who has what it takes to fix an economy that's deep in debt, bleeding jobs by the year and suffering through 30 years of decline.  <paragraph>  Now is not the time to tell jokes. Now is the time to lead. So Mitt Romney, lead. And leave the bad jokes to Jay Leno.
