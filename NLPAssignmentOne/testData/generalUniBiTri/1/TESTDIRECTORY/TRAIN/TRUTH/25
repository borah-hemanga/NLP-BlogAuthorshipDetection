2/27/12 5:53 PM EST | A reporter's notebook... |  <paragraph>   To better serve you, the dedicated POLITICO blog reader, I travel the globe regularly to grasp the challenges facing other countries in hopes of improving our own. Like Thomas Friedman, David Ignatius and Nick Kristof, I know the big story never lands on a newsroom desk. That is why this weekend, I went on assignment in the most trying of circumstances.  <paragraph>   After arriving at the Lanesborough Hotel in Knightsbridge, London, I dug right in to my assignment despite the challenging surroundings. After having to call the butler TWICE to get the right Visconti pen to begin this posting, I soon became bored at the thought of writing anything so I ordered "Old School" on TV and called it a night.    <paragraph>   The next morning I began my journalistic journey in earnest and began studying the current British economic crisis, Prime Minister Cameron's response to that crisis, and how the Chancellor of the Exchequer's austerity program has impacted disposable income -- specifically, among English scousers who are also soccer fans. From the outset of my trip, I had hoped to challenge the preposterous assumption (repeated by absolutely nobody that I know) that the British economy is so bad that even rabid fans from Northern England would fail to make this weekend's trip to Wembley to see Liverpool win the League Cup in glorious style.  <paragraph>   Happily, my brutish slog across the pond was rewarded by the accumulation of massive evidence that British pensioners continue to spend their money on life's basics -- kegs of Carlsberg, graphic tattoos and overpriced futbol tickets. I even considered, albeit briefly, leaving my luxury box to interview the teeming masses but thought the better of it. Instead, I picked up a paper on the way to Heathrow this morning and was surprised by how closely the     <hyperlink>    current British crisis parallels our own. <paragraph>       <quotation>      <paragraph>   Whoever wins the 2012 election will be faced with the same reality when they are sworn in the following January. But the question for historians is whether this global economic crisis will be solved by President Obama's trillion dollar deficits or by Prime Minister Cameron's austere approach.  <paragraph>   My money is on Cameron. But at this point in the crisis, politicians on both sides of the political divide -- and on both sides of the Atlantic -- are whistling past graveyards.
