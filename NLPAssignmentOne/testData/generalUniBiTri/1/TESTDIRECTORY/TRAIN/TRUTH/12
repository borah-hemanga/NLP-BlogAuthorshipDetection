5/19/12 1:58 PM EDT  | These are not the Times to be biased | <paragraph>  Maybe I shouldn't be so tough on those I love. God knows I would have more friends in my own political party if I had kept my mouth shut while George W. Bush was running up trillions in debt and aping Woodrow Wilson on the world stage. But I can't help myself. Maybe I just expect more from those I love.  <paragraph>  Which brings me to the New York Times. I often criticize the Old Gray Lady despite the fact it's the one newspaper I must read daily.  <paragraph>  I expect its editorial page to reflect the liberal community it serves. And I endure its left-leaning story selection because it also brings the best writing and reporting in the world to my doorstep. But it tends to embarrass itself occasionally during heated presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>  The Times' public editor recently scolded his paper's past cheerleading for Barack Obama, and for good reason. The paper published separate profiles of John and Cindy McCain during the peak of the 2008 campaign that smeared the GOP nominee and his wife. When this kind of slanted reporting wins the day, I am as distressed at the Times' failings as I am when Republican politicians stop being conservative and start being radical. <paragraph>  This past week the Newspaper of Record ran a story above the fold on page one reporting that Republicans were preparing a new round of attacks on Barack Obama's relationship with Jeremiah Wright. They followed that Thursday story with a follow up article the next day. And then today, the Times' "Political Memo" stirred the pot again by writing this:  <paragraph>  A report in The New York Times on Thursday exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama’s onetime pastor, and his angry black-power sermons.  <paragraph>  Perhaps this news story might justify a three day roll out if, in fact, that narrative were accurate. Sadly, for the New York Times and Barack Obama's campaign, it is not.  <paragraph>  Despite what the Times claims, the undisputed facts are these: 1. There was no "secret plan" by "strategists" or "financiers" to push the Wright story, 2. The super pac in question asked advertisers to bring them ad ideas focused on the federal debt, 3. The ad man who pitched the idea to the super pac conceded that the group did not want proposals that dealt with anything other than fiscal issues, 4. Mitt Romney and his campaign had nothing to do with anything involving this ad. 5. The Republican Party had nothing to do with anything involving this pitch.   <paragraph>  Anyone who has spent any time working on a political campaign knows that terrible ideas bubble up and are popped by smart managers every five minutes or so. The fact that the New York Times decided to seize on a stupid idea by a guy not connected to (a) the super pac, (b) the RNC or (c) the Romney campaign shows just how much of a stretch it was to put Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg's story on the top of page one.  <paragraph>  Zeleny and Rutenberg are great reporters. And their story calling out a single strategist for pushing this self-destructive idea should find its way into the news stream. But until the New York Times begins publishing the moronic ideas of Democratic ad men making pitches to George Soros or Ted Turner, they should limit their breathless attacks against a political party they clearly oppose.  <paragraph>  This responsibility falls on the shoulders of editors who need to show a bit more partisan restraint on page one during election years. Such restraint will help them avoid the perception that they are shamelessly cheerleading for Democrats while maintaining the loyalty of many readers who do not share the editors' political views.
