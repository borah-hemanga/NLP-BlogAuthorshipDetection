Senate incumbents outpaced Obama | <picture> Image courtesy of PoliticsPA  <paragraph>  The website   <hyperlink>  PoliticsPA crunches the numbers and finds that Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, whose lead appeared to be narrowing late in the campaign, ended up outperforming President Barack Obama nearly everywhere in Pennsylvania — including Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Casey wasn’t alone in running ahead of the president: Every Senate Democratic incumbent on the ballot, with the exception of Maryland’s Ben Cardin, outpaced Obama this year. So did a handful of challengers, including Tim Kaine of Virginia, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.  <paragraph>  None ran quite so far ahead of the ticket as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who was 25 percentage points ahead of the president and won 160,000 more votes than Obama — a stunning number for such a small state.  <paragraph>  How weak was Obama’s performance in West Virginia? Not only did he lose all 55 counties, he even won fewer votes than Manchin’s GOP opponent, John Raese.
