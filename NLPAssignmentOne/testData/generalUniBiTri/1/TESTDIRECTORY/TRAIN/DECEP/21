11/5/12 9:08 PM EST  | PPP: Obama leads everywhere |   <paragraph>   The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling has come in for a great deal of criticism this year, mainly from Republicans questioning its motives and methodology.  <paragraph>   The prolific pollster regularly produces quality work, but its Democratic affiliations and occasionally suspect practices [  <hyperlink> here and   <hyperlink> here] have led Republicans to dismiss its findings in the same manner that Democrats dismiss Rasmussen polls as biased toward the GOP.  <paragraph>   Now, almost on cue, PPP has delivered a final series of state polls that puts President Barack Obama in the lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reports a 49-49 tie.  <paragraph>   Against the backdrop of a highly competitive election, the uniformity of those results — and the fact that PPP shows 5- to 6-point spreads in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — puts the firm out on a ledge. So when the final state outcomes are known, PPP figures to be one of the election’s biggest winners or losers, poised either to spike the football — or to explain what went wrong.
