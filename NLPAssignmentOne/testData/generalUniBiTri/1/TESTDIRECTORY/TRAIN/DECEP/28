10/27/12 12:27 PM EDT | Fla. insiders: Romney will win state  |    <paragraph>   Florida’s top politicos believe by an overwhelming margin that Mitt Romney will carry the state on Election Day.    <paragraph>   According to the latest     <hyperlink>    Tampa Bay Times survey of 120 of Florida’s top political insiders, 73 percent expect Romney will win Florida, compared to just 27 percent who think President Barack Obama will win the state a second time.    <paragraph>   The list of 120 insiders – consultants, lobbyists, fundraisers, political scientists, etc. -- is a little top heavy with Republicans: it’s made up of 65 Republicans, 48 Democrats and 7 independents or minor party types.    <paragraph>   But even among Democrats, 60 percent think Romney will carry Florida. Republicans are more certain: 95 percent believe Romney will win the state’s 29 electoral votes.    <paragraph>   While much of the October polling validates the notion that Romney has the edge in the nation’s largest swing state, all signs point to a very tight finish. At the moment, the RealClearPolitics polling average spread between the candidates is 1.8 percentage points.
