11/21/12 11:51 AM EST | Allen West's cautionary tale |  <paragraph>   If you’re wondering how a member of Congress could raise more than $17 million for his reelection bid and still lose, read Alex Isenstadt’s     <hyperlink>    excellent post-mortem on GOP Rep. Allen West’s defeat.    <paragraph>   Alex reports that West had sky-high name ID, a Republican-leaning district, an inexperienced 29-year-old Democratic foe and an election eve lead in his internal polling but still fell short in the end.    <paragraph>   It’s a cautionary tale, not for the average House member but for political provocateurs like West. In his case, he learned the hard way that the iron laws of politics apply even to congressmen with a national base of support.    <paragraph>   His outspoken and over-the-top style, it seems, was out of sync with the locals in his highly competitive district — and he didn’t dial it down in the face of a tough reelection race. Top of the ticket performance was also a problem since President Obama goosed Democratic turnout in his south Florida seat.    <paragraph>   West’s Republican colleagues in Tallahassee didn’t exactly have his back, either. As a relative newcomer to politics, and with his eye fixed on Washington, West lacked relationships in the GOP-controlled state capital that might have resulted in a safer district from redistricting.    <paragraph>   It’s unlikely that we’ve heard the last of West, however. As Alex notes, cable news will still find him an attractive guest. And with his national following and proven fundraising talent — he raised at least $23 million in his two congressional races, a stunning amount for a House candidate — he would be a competitive candidate for any office he sought.    <paragraph>   There’s even a comeback model for lightning-rod pols like West.    <paragraph>   Just a few hours up the road, Democrat Alan Grayson returned to Congress this year after suffering a fate similar to West in 2010. Like West, Grayson’s brand of combative and outspoken liberalism was a mismatch for his more temperate Orlando district.    <paragraph>   But with his prolific fundraising and base of support he was able to jump on his first opportunity to return to Congress, when a new, heavily Democratic seat opened after redistricting. No one bothered to challenge him in the Democratic primary and Grayson won in a November cakewalk.
