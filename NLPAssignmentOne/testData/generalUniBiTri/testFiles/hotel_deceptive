11/20/12 2:40 PM EST | House Dems dominated by 4 states |   <paragraph>  The University of Minnesota’s  <hyperlink>  Smart Politics blog looks at the composition of the 113th Congress and reports that the House Democratic Caucus will be dominated by two big blue states:  <paragraph>  <quotation>  <paragraph>  If you add in Illinois and Massachusetts, then 40 percent of the Democratic Caucus hails from just four blue states.  <paragraph>  There’s a danger, of course, when such a high proportion of members hail from just a few states. As the GOP is learning from its overreliance on the South, it’s easy to develop a tin ear when a party is too concentrated in states where the political climate is unrepresentative of the nation as a whole.
11/18/12 12:29 PM EST | An early abortion rights test for Dems |   <paragraph>  The Democratic Party’s full and unyielding embrace of abortion rights in 2012 – a subtle but conspicuous repositioning – is about to be tested in a contest for the top Democratic slot on the powerful Appropriations Committee between Reps. Nita Lowey and Marcy Kaptur.  <paragraph>  From a report Sunday in  <hyperlink>  The Hill: <quotation>   <paragraph>  While support for abortion rights isn’t the only issue at play in the competition for the ranking Democratic position on the spending panel, the debate provides a window into the priorities and current thinking in the caucus.  <paragraph>  When Republicans chose a new chairman after the 2010 election, the battle lines were drawn over pork-barreling practices and appropriations reform.
11/13/12 4:27 PM EST  | The ever more solid South |   <paragraph>  Election Day was a downer for Republicans in most states, but not Alabama. Mitt Romney won by more than 20 points there and the GOP picked off the last remaining statewide Democrat. <paragraph>  What little Democratic strength remains in Alabama is concentrated at the county courthouse level.  <paragraph>  From the   <hyperlink>  Associated Press report:  <quotation>  <paragraph>  The South, as a whole, was largely resistant to the Democratic winds last week. The GOP now controls every legislature in the South, and every governorship except Arkansas. Republicans also managed to hold every one of its House and Senate seats in the region on Election Day – and even managed to pick up a few House seats.
11/8/12 7:20 PM EST | The GOP's Asian erosion |   <paragraph>  Latinos and African-Americans weren’t the only groups to deliver landslide margins to President Barack Obama on Tuesday.  <paragraph>  According to national exit polls, Obama won 73 percent of the Asian-American vote.  <paragraph>  While Asians only constituted 2 percent of the national electorate, in some states they made up a considerably higher proportion. In California, for example, they represented 11 percent of the vote.  <paragraph>   <quotation>   said California Democratic Rep. Mike Honda, chairman emeritus of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, in an email.  <quotation>   <paragraph>  Asian voters weren't always so far out of reach for Republicans.  <paragraph>  In 1992, exit polls showed President George H.W. Bush captured the Asian vote 55 percent to 31 percent.  But the end of the Cold War loosened the GOP ties of some Asian subgroups, marking the beginning of a two-decade-long free fall that landed 3 of every 4 Asian voters in the Democratic camp Tuesday.
11/7/12 2:24 AM EST | A GOP wipeout in New England |  <paragraph>  The New England wing of the House GOP, after showing brief signs of life, is extinct again.  <paragraph>  Democrats cleaned out the region on Tuesday, knocking off New Hampshire GOP Reps Charlie Bass and Frank Giunta and fending off stiff challenges to Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney and Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline. Republicans also lost a toss-up open seat race in Connecticut.  <paragraph>  The GOP didn’t fare much better in New England’s Senate races either. Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown lost his seat, Independent Angus King captured retiring Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe’s seat, and Linda McMahon spent more than $40 million in a losing bid for Connecticut’s open Senate seat. In Vermont, meanwhile, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders demolished his GOP foe in a 71-25 landslide while Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse won 65-35.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink>  Also on POLITICO: Republicans keep control of House)  <paragraph>  New England was without Republican representation in the House for two years after the 2008 defeat of Connecticut Rep. Chris Shays but the election of Bass and Giunta in 2010, along with GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, suggested the GOP still had a pulse.
11/3/12 7:00 AM EDT | Final PPP poll: Warren leads Brown by 6 |   <paragraph>     <picture>    <paragraph>   In Public Policy Polling’s   <hyperlink> final Massachusetts poll, the Democratic firm reports Elizabeth Warren holds a 52 percent to 46 percent advantage over GOP Sen. Scott Brown.  <paragraph>   PPP is in line with 4 other pollsters – including Rasmussen – who have shown Warren with a 5 to 7 point edge since late October.  <paragraph>   If Brown falls short on Tuesday, he’ll rate as one of the most popular incumbents ever to lose a re-election bid. Many of his Senate colleagues would die for his approval ratings: according to PPP, 52 percent approve of his job performance, compared to just 36 percent who disapprove.  <paragraph>   Independents love him: He’s winning 59-38 among independents/others and his approval ratings are 62-25.  <paragraph>   The hurdle Brown faces, of course, is the state’s lopsided Democratic registration advantage – 36 percent of voters are Democrats, compared to just 11 percent Republicans. Fifty-three percent are designated as unenrolled.  <paragraph>   If this latest PPP poll is correct, Warren is winning a higher percentage of Democrats than Martha Coakley, Brown’s Democratic opponent in 2010, and Brown is winning independents by a smaller margin.  <paragraph>   Simply put, given the political make-up of Massachusetts, Brown needs to be winning a greater share of Democratic and independent votes if he hopes to hold his seat on Election Day.
11/3/12 10:33 PM EST | The United States of Irrelevance |  <paragraph>   The award for the best campaign story of the day goes to a reporter who isn’t even on the election beat.  <paragraph>   Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for the New York Times, has a must-read about America’s shrinking electoral battleground, and the toxic effects of a system where the vast majority of states are ignored during presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> Liptak writes:   <quotation> <paragraph>   The phenomenon Liptak writes about is well-known, but the figures he marshals – and the past landscape he chronicles -- are nevertheless eye-opening.  <paragraph>   In 1960 and 1976, for example, there were 30 contested states including California, Illinois, New York and Texas – in 1976, both California and Texas were decided by three percentage points or less. Today, all have been largely reduced to ATM machine status in presidential elections because the results are a foregone conclusion.  <paragraph>   The scene Liptak leads the story with, Nixon campaigning in all 50 states, is all but unthinkable today.  <paragraph>   One reason, of course, is that many believe Nixon’s pledge to visit every state might have cost him the 1960 election since he refused to forego an Alaska trip in the final days – it was time that would have been better spent in a state offering a bigger electoral vote haul.  <paragraph>   But, as Theodore White wrote in his groundbreaking work, The Making of the President 1960, Nixon’s rigorous and far-reaching schedule was a source of pride.   <quotation>
11/21/12 1:08 PM EST | Club to GOP: Define 'electable' | <paragraph>   In response to signals that the GOP establishment is prepared to play a more aggressive role in 2014 Senate primaries, Club for Growth President Chris Chocola fires a shot across the bow in    <hyperlink>    an op-ed published Wednesday.    <paragraph>       <quotation>       <paragraph>   Chocola, a former GOP congressman from Indiana, points to a litany of top, establishment-favored candidates who lost in 2012 and also to a rogue’s gallery of so-called ‘electable’ GOP House and Senate candidates who backfired in spectacular fashion in recent years: Dede Scozzafava, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist.     <paragraph>   The venue for the op-ed is notable – the Kansas City Star, a Missouri-based paper with a big circulation in the backyards of Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, the incoming National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt.     <paragraph>   Blunt, a member of Senate leadership, and Moran both     <hyperlink>    expressed support – however gingerly -- for the notion of greater national involvement in interviews with POLITICO’s Manu Raju last week.     <paragraph>   Chocola’s message is a reminder that even the sweeping 2012 Senate losses haven’t resolved the intra-party conflicts that cost the GOP a handful of seats in the last two election cycles.     <paragraph>   With the possibility of several primary challenges to GOP incumbents in 2014, as well as a handful of other attractive Democratic-held seats that could generate contentious GOP primaries, the balance struck between the national party and groups like CFG will likely determine whether or not the GOP has a shot at winning back the majority.
10/28/12 7:01 AM EDT | Obama hopes fade in Nebraska |     <paragraph>   A new Omaha World-Herald poll suggests that President Barack Obama’s chances of a repeat win in Nebraska are fading.    <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    According to the survey, conducted Oct. 23-25, Mitt Romney leads Obama 49 percent to 44 percent in the Omaha-based 2nd District, and a comfortable 52 percent to 38 percent margin statewide. The last time the poll was in the field, in late September, the race was deadlocked at 44 percent in the 2nd District. <paragraph>   The Omaha-based district has been     <hyperlink>    closely watched this year after it produced one of the biggest surprises of 2008 by voting narrowly for Obama. Back then, the Obama campaign captured one of the conservative state’s five electoral votes by taking advantage of Nebraska’s unusual electoral vote allocation — it’s one of just two states (the other is Maine) that awards its electoral votes by congressional district, rather than to the overall state winner.    <paragraph>   In his post-election book, campaign manager David Plouffe labeled the Nebraska district <quotation>
10/22/12 10:27 AM EDT | Linda McMahon's presidential play |  <paragraph>   <video>    <paragraph>   Back in 2010, President Obama dismissed Republican Linda McMahon’s wealth and her background as a pro wrestling executive. The choice between McMahon and Democrat Richard Blumenthal in the open Connecticut Senate race that year, he said, was a     <quotation>       <paragraph>   Nevertheless, McMahon, who is running again for Senate this year, is up with a spot urging voters to split their tickets and cast votes for her and the president.    <paragraph>   It’s a matter of political necessity. While Obama isn’t likely to win Connecticut by the same margin as in 2008, when he won 61 percent to John McCain’s 38 percent, he still leads Mitt Romney there by double digits in the polls. That’s a considerable top-of-the-ticket drag for a candidate like McMahon who’s locked in a tight race with Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy.    <paragraph>   And for blue state Obama voters who simply can’t envision themselves casting a GOP vote, McMahon’s ad (titled     <quotation>   ) notes they can support on her on the Independent line — the other ballot line she qualified for.    <paragraph>   The second ballot line could end up making the difference in a razor-thin race. In 2010, the votes Gov. Dannel Malloy won on the Working Families party line put him over the top against Republican Tom Foley.
