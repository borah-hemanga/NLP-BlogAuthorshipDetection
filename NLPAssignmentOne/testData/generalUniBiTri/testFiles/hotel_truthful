10/31/12 5:33 AM EDT | Polls: Romney running out of time | New polls released by the New York Times and Quinnipiac today suggest that Mitt Romney is running out of time in his fight to win the White House. <paragraph> With President Obama maintaining his five-point lead in Ohio in today's poll, Romney must run the table on the six remaining swing states or expand the electoral map. Considering how rough the internals look in this morning's Ohio survey, Boston must know that winning the White House now depends on their candidate stealing Michigan, Minnesota or Pennsylvania out of the Obama column next Tuesday. Their play in those three Midwest states now appears to be more out of weakness than strength, though a new survey does put Romney within 3 points in Michigan.
6/21/12 6:36 PM EDT | Beware of summertime subpoenas | <paragraph> If it's summer, it must be time for a scandal. Or at least summertime in Washington has long seemed a season for faux high-drama, with committee chairmen all looking for their Sam Ervin moment. <paragraph> Here's a reality check: There's a reason Sam Ervin was Sam Ervin; He had Watergate. <paragraph> The latest entrant in the scandal sweepstakes is the "Fast and Furious" showdown, with GOP Chairman Darrell Issa battling Attorney General Eric Holder. For the ideologically uninitiated, "Fast and Furious" was a bungled ATF operation that funneled guns to Mexican cartels. By the time the dust settled, a U.S. agent was dead. <paragraph> Chairman Issa and Republican leaders are right to want answers. They know that an embarrassed White House wants to keep damning facts away from the press during an election year. And now Mr. Issa wants to find Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over those documents. <paragraph> There are real issues about executive power at stake, and even the dead agent's family want President Barack Obama to be more forthcoming about the operation.  But Congressman Issa should beware the political siren song of headlines and cable crawls. Americans care about jobs, and the image of flying subpoenas and internal fighting are more likely to turn off key independent voters than they are to bring Justice to justice. <paragraph> As a surviving member of the GOP Congress who subpoenaed Bill Clinton's White House for the better part of eight years, I know firsthand that what makes for good partisan headlines can also make for bad election-year politics.
11/15/12 12:15 PM EST | Mitt Romney's post-election gaffe |   <paragraph>  Mitt Romney proved again that in Washington, a gaffe is when you accidentally say something that you mean. He also showed why he was ideologically unfit to be the Republican nominee for president.  <paragraph>  For Mr. Romney, the gaffe caught on camera and made public in September was that 47 percent of Americans are victims, grifters and thieves. And in a conference call with supporters on Wednesday, the former Massachusetts governor further exposed just how sheltered his life has been by explaining that these grifters were mostly minorities bought off with "gifts" from Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  The conference call underlined what I have been saying for well over a year: that Mr. Romney has no idea what conservatism offers 100 percent of Americans who believe that freedom leads to prosperity and centralized planning is a road to serfdom. That message led Margaret Thatcher to an unlikely victory in 1979 and Ronald Reagan to a historical landslide a year later. And if Mr. Romney believes that message is no longer relevant to Hispanics and African-Americans, he should've stayed in La Jolla to oversee the building of his car elevator.  <paragraph>  The future belongs to conservatism. It's time Republicans start electing leaders who actually believe it
5/24/12 10:27 PM EDT |  270 to win |   <paragraph>  Mark Halperin and I looked over the electoral map this morning during a commercial break and were surprised by how quickly our view of the political landscape has changed over the past few weeks. With the economy flatlining and the president's declaration on gay marriage sparking controversy across the South, much has changed politically since the beginning of May.  <paragraph>  According to both campaigns, the swing states most impacted by gay marriage will be Florida, North Carolina, Iowa and Ohio. Most insiders believe that Florida and North Carolina are swinging Mitt Romney's way and now seem to be uphill climbs for the president. Ohio will be impacted by gay marriage on election day, but to a lesser degree than Southern states. Still, that issue (along with the possible selection of Ohio Senator Rob Portman as Romney's running mate) could tip the Buckeye State state back into the Republican column once again.  <paragraph>  Which leads to Mr. Halperin's and my surprising takeaway this morning.  <paragraph>  If Mitt Romney is able to steal Florida, Ohio and North Carolina from Team Obama, the two key swing states this November will turn out to be the unlikely pair of Virginia and Colorado. Even though the last two cycles have made it seem like Florida and Ohio would be the swing states that mattered most for years to come, it now looks like we will all be focused on "Virginia, Virginia, Virginia" late into the night on November 6th.  <paragraph>  This could, of course, all change if it is a Romney surrogate who goes on a Sunday morning show and veers wildly off message by calling everyone who ever worked for Bain Capital "a bunch of greedy bastards." But don't expect that to happen. But do expect a campaign that may focus less on Florida and Ohio than states like Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire and Nevada. These states that were second-tier swing states not so long ago now seem poised to help decide who sits in the Oval Office over the next four years.
5/10/12 5:02 PM EDT | Making love out of nothing at all |  <paragraph>  The response to President Obama's same-sex marriage statement yesterday was fascinating on many fronts. Most entertaining was the reaction of the president's cheering section in the mainstream media.  <paragraph>  Who knew the New York Times could be such champions of states' rights?  <paragraph>  In fact, I think it is safe to say that this many Democrats haven't been as supportive of 10th Amendment federalism since Lester Maddox and George Wallace controlled Southern states during the days of segregation.  <paragraph>  The best laugh-out-loud moment came when the Times sent out a breathless breaking news alert at 3:16 pm, crammed with shameless spin and naked cheerleading. Public Editor Arthur Brisbane take note that the Newspaper of Record recorded the moment this way:  <paragraph>   <quotation>    <paragraph>  The moral power of his presidency? Really?  <paragraph>  Exactly how did the New York Times come to that conclusion when Barack Obama said he would not use his power as president to stop others from banning gay marriage?  <paragraph>  Did any member of the Times newsroom actually believe that the president was ever personally against same-sex marriage? Where was the editor who approved that language over the past decade?  <paragraph>  Do these progressive cheerleaders of the president realize that their hero has now adopted a position on gay marriage that is horrifyingly close to the views of Ron Paul, Barry Goldwater, William F. Buckley, Ronald Reagan and yes, even me.  <paragraph>  If not, they should.  <paragraph>  Since I believe that most social issues should be handled on the state level, Barack Obama's declaration was like Morning in America all over again!  <paragraph>  But the impact of Obama's statement may not be so positive in the long run for America's top newspapers and networks. They continue to be enablers of a liberal politician who has long played a cynical game on an issue critical to most who run those same media outlets.  <paragraph>  Is a Democratic victory in November really that important to these journalists or are they just blinded by love? The only thing that the statement by the president proved is that those same news organizations are now defending a position on gay marriage that would make Bill Buckley proud.
4/23/12 9:57 PM EDT | Some liberals ask: What would Jerry do? |   <paragraph>  Since Jerry Falwell founded The Moral Majority in 1979, few things have unified American liberals as much as their contempt for self-righteous types who pushed a political agenda by attacking the faith of partisan opponents.  <paragraph>  For over a quarter of a century, left-wing thought leaders have roundly (and rightly) condemned those who self-righteously attacked political foes for their religious beliefs. In recent years, some on the right embarrassed themselves by questioning the faith of a president who publicly declared his faith in Jesus Christ as his Lord and personal savior.  <paragraph>  That is why it is so surprising that some supporters of the president are starting to attack Republicans based on religion. Mitt Romney's faith is now attacked on news networks and by liberal websites, suggesting that Mormonism is a cult and that Mitt Romney is heading for Hell. Others are claiming that Jesus Christ would be upset at the priorities laid out in the GOP House Budget for FY 2013. <paragraph>  What a joke.  <paragraph>  Supporters of the president would do better to focus on creating jobs than channeling Jesus. Their recent attacks make them look as pathetic as those conservatives who refuse to take President Obama's testimony at face value.
4/5/12 12:07 PM EDT | Sliming the Supreme Court |   <paragraph>  I love Bobby Knight. The former Indiana basketball coaching legend used to run up and down the sidelines screaming at shrinking referees in hopes of having the next call go his way.  <paragraph>  The New York Times' editorial page is now doing their best Bobby Knight imitation in covering the Supreme Court in a way that matches the former Hoosier's red-faced rage insult by insult.  <paragraph>  In this case, the intended target is Justice Anthony Kennedy instead of a poor, shriveled-up referee. The Times knows that with the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Kennedy is the only member left on the Court who can be swayed by such non-germane items as New York Times editorials.  <paragraph>  Understanding the breadth of their power, the editorial page editors decided to use their Sunday space  <hyperlink>  to personally attack any Supreme Court justice who had the temerity to raise questions during last week's oral arguments. Those who did were blasted by the editorial page as  <quotation>   and being  <quotation>    <paragraph>  In the same editorial, the Times labeled the four liberal justices as  <quotation>  who  <quotation>    <paragraph>  Excuse me for a moment while I go throw up… OK. I'm back.  <paragraph>  The Times’ description of the "moderates" is laughable at best.  <paragraph>  Their voting patterns are every bit as predictably liberal as Scalia, Thomas, Roberts and Alito line up as a conservative block.  In this particular case, the Times’ description of the Court's left wing voting block is particularly hilarious considering that one of those impartial  <quotation>  was sending euphoric emails to liberal law professor Larry Tribe during the passage of the very law that she will now judge.  <paragraph>  Maureen Dowd went Full-Bobby with   <hyperlink>  her rant against the Court, attacking them as  <quotation>  who are  <quotation>  Dowd goes on to say, the Court is  <quotation>   <quotation>  and  <quotation>   <paragraph>  Maureen slimed Justice Scalia as  <quotation>  called Chief Justice  <quotation>   and dismissed Justice Alito as being <quotation>  <paragraph>  But then Coach Dowd clumsily showed her hand when she ended the column by declaring that the  <quotation>  was now resting in the hands of Anthony Kennedy.  <paragraph>  Will Justice Kennedy be influenced by the all-too-obvious gamesmanship of the Times editorial page? I doubt it. I'm fairly sure the Times (and the president) overplayed their hands and somehow succeeded in making the justices look sympathetic.  <paragraph>  As the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger wrote today <quotation>    <paragraph>  I suspect Henninger is right. Even Bobby Knight knew that spewing personal insults and throwing chairs at refs backfires more often than not.
3/25/12 2:16 PM EDT | Why Romney's Dixie drought could doom the GOP |  <paragraph>   Many are discounting Rick Santorum's big win in Louisiana last night as too little too late. Perhaps they should take a second look.  <paragraph>   The former Pennsylvania senator almost beat the front-runner by a two-to-one margin, reeling in almost 50 percent of the vote in a four-person race. More important to Republicans who want to win the White House this fall is the continued weakness Massachusetts' Mitt Romney is showing in the South.   <paragraph>   Romney's performance south of the Mason-Dixon line has been pathetic. Despite having all the money, organization and endorsements that matter, Romney finished third in Alabama, third in Mississippi and a distant second in Louisiana. He was stomped by Newt Gingrich by an average of 20 points in South Carolina and Georgia and had his 13 worst performances in 2008 in the Deep South.  <paragraph>   There was a time when the South was solidly Republican but those days are gone. Barack Obama won Virginia and North Carolina four years ago and came close to beating John McCain in Georgia. Bill Clinton beat George Bush in Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia.  <paragraph>   Romney's continued weakness in the Heart of Dixie spells trouble for the GOP this fall. The only question is whether it will take a Santorum win in Wisconsin to refocus Republican minds on the unassailable fact that GOP presidential candidates cannot win unless they have the support of rock-ribbed conservatives. Mitt Romney does not, and that is becoming clearer by the day in this painful primary season.
2/15/12 6:33 PM EST | Team Mitt dumps dirt on Santorum |  <paragraph>   Mitt Romney's campaign excels in the dark art of opposition research. If you don't believe me, just ask any top operative working for the former Massachusetts governor. He or she will gladly plant a story confirming their tactical genius with the nearest New York Times reporter. But over the past 24 hours, Team Romney has instead focused on hammering Rick Santorum with a slew of well-placed stories.   <paragraph>   A number of Rick's past interviews involving contraception have magically begun to resurface and are racing across the Internet after being picked up by the     <hyperlink>    Washington Post and     <hyperlink>    Time. Chances are good the content of those conversations will help opponents in their efforts to paint Santorum as an extremist on social issues.   <paragraph>   So what's the problem? Well, for starters, the GOP front-runner declared in a 2006 interview with     <hyperlink>    CN8 that contraception was     <quotation>    and     <quotation>    That position is so obviously outside the mainstream of American culture that I suspect it will even lose him votes in Southern primaries next month.    <paragraph>   When the CN8 interview was conducted six years ago, Rick Santorum assured the interviewer that he would not allow his private beliefs on contraception to conflict with public policy. But that public-private divide was nowhere to be found when he gave an    <hyperlink>    interview to a Christian website in October 2011 (start watching 17:45 in).    <paragraph>   In the interview posted on Time's website, Santorum warned that contraceptives were dangerous to women and declared that     <quotation>   to use birth control. The current GOP front-runner went on to describe contraceptives as a license to engage in immoral acts and to     <quotation>       <paragraph>   These newly discovered interviews damage Rick Santorum's campaign in the same way President Obama's HHS ruling caused a temporary setback to the White House last week. That's because both the Obama and Santorum story lines fed into an existing narrative that concerns independent voters.    <paragraph>   All those who feared that Barack Obama was a big government liberal took no comfort from his showdown with a unified Catholic Church. Their claim that Washington was infringing on their religious liberties was a crisis in the making. But President Obama's ability to form an alliance with a group of progressive Catholics late in the week helped neutralize that issue for the White House. <paragraph>   Those who fear that Rick Santorum is an extremist on social issues will not have their fears assuaged by these two interviews. As Time's Michael Scherer points out in his post, 99% of American women have used contraceptives at one time in their life. And late this afternoon, women's groups began     <hyperlink>    attacking Santorum for statements made in these two interviews.    <paragraph>   Like President Obama, Mr. Santorum better put this contraceptive crisis behind him soon or Mitt Romney will avoid the Michigan Meltdown that many were predicting just this morning.
8/21/12 7:48 PM EDT | Doubts about Akin's cause | <paragraph>   Todd Akin says he's staying in the race because     <quotation>       <paragraph>   Perhaps he is right. Perhaps there is a cause worth risking a Republican Senate, that is worth risking two more years with Harry Reid as Majority Leader, that is worth damaging the Republican brand and is worth casting a dark shadow over Mitt Romney's convention next week.    <paragraph>   But if there is a cause worthy of losing the U.S. Senate and damaging Romney and Ryan's chances against Barack Obama, I sure don't see it.  <paragraph>   I look forward to Congressman Akin's explanation.
