11/21/12 1:08 PM EST | Club to GOP: Define 'electable' | <paragraph>   In response to signals that the GOP establishment is prepared to play a more aggressive role in 2014 Senate primaries, Club for Growth President Chris Chocola fires a shot across the bow in    <hyperlink>    an op-ed published Wednesday.    <paragraph>       <quotation>       <paragraph>   Chocola, a former GOP congressman from Indiana, points to a litany of top, establishment-favored candidates who lost in 2012 and also to a rogue’s gallery of so-called ‘electable’ GOP House and Senate candidates who backfired in spectacular fashion in recent years: Dede Scozzafava, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist.     <paragraph>   The venue for the op-ed is notable – the Kansas City Star, a Missouri-based paper with a big circulation in the backyards of Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, the incoming National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt.     <paragraph>   Blunt, a member of Senate leadership, and Moran both     <hyperlink>    expressed support – however gingerly -- for the notion of greater national involvement in interviews with POLITICO’s Manu Raju last week.     <paragraph>   Chocola’s message is a reminder that even the sweeping 2012 Senate losses haven’t resolved the intra-party conflicts that cost the GOP a handful of seats in the last two election cycles.     <paragraph>   With the possibility of several primary challenges to GOP incumbents in 2014, as well as a handful of other attractive Democratic-held seats that could generate contentious GOP primaries, the balance struck between the national party and groups like CFG will likely determine whether or not the GOP has a shot at winning back the majority.
