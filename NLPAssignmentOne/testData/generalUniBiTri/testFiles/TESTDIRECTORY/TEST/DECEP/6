11/3/12 7:00 AM EDT | Final PPP poll: Warren leads Brown by 6 |   <paragraph>     <picture>    <paragraph>   In Public Policy Polling’s   <hyperlink> final Massachusetts poll, the Democratic firm reports Elizabeth Warren holds a 52 percent to 46 percent advantage over GOP Sen. Scott Brown.  <paragraph>   PPP is in line with 4 other pollsters – including Rasmussen – who have shown Warren with a 5 to 7 point edge since late October.  <paragraph>   If Brown falls short on Tuesday, he’ll rate as one of the most popular incumbents ever to lose a re-election bid. Many of his Senate colleagues would die for his approval ratings: according to PPP, 52 percent approve of his job performance, compared to just 36 percent who disapprove.  <paragraph>   Independents love him: He’s winning 59-38 among independents/others and his approval ratings are 62-25.  <paragraph>   The hurdle Brown faces, of course, is the state’s lopsided Democratic registration advantage – 36 percent of voters are Democrats, compared to just 11 percent Republicans. Fifty-three percent are designated as unenrolled.  <paragraph>   If this latest PPP poll is correct, Warren is winning a higher percentage of Democrats than Martha Coakley, Brown’s Democratic opponent in 2010, and Brown is winning independents by a smaller margin.  <paragraph>   Simply put, given the political make-up of Massachusetts, Brown needs to be winning a greater share of Democratic and independent votes if he hopes to hold his seat on Election Day.
