11/3/12 10:33 PM EST | The United States of Irrelevance |  <paragraph>   The award for the best campaign story of the day goes to a reporter who isn’t even on the election beat.  <paragraph>   Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for the New York Times, has a must-read about America’s shrinking electoral battleground, and the toxic effects of a system where the vast majority of states are ignored during presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> Liptak writes:   <quotation> <paragraph>   The phenomenon Liptak writes about is well-known, but the figures he marshals – and the past landscape he chronicles -- are nevertheless eye-opening.  <paragraph>   In 1960 and 1976, for example, there were 30 contested states including California, Illinois, New York and Texas – in 1976, both California and Texas were decided by three percentage points or less. Today, all have been largely reduced to ATM machine status in presidential elections because the results are a foregone conclusion.  <paragraph>   The scene Liptak leads the story with, Nixon campaigning in all 50 states, is all but unthinkable today.  <paragraph>   One reason, of course, is that many believe Nixon’s pledge to visit every state might have cost him the 1960 election since he refused to forego an Alaska trip in the final days – it was time that would have been better spent in a state offering a bigger electoral vote haul.  <paragraph>   But, as Theodore White wrote in his groundbreaking work, The Making of the President 1960, Nixon’s rigorous and far-reaching schedule was a source of pride.   <quotation>
