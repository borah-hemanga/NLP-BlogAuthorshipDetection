2/15/12 6:33 PM EST | Team Mitt dumps dirt on Santorum |  <paragraph>   Mitt Romney's campaign excels in the dark art of opposition research. If you don't believe me, just ask any top operative working for the former Massachusetts governor. He or she will gladly plant a story confirming their tactical genius with the nearest New York Times reporter. But over the past 24 hours, Team Romney has instead focused on hammering Rick Santorum with a slew of well-placed stories.   <paragraph>   A number of Rick's past interviews involving contraception have magically begun to resurface and are racing across the Internet after being picked up by the     <hyperlink>    Washington Post and     <hyperlink>    Time. Chances are good the content of those conversations will help opponents in their efforts to paint Santorum as an extremist on social issues.   <paragraph>   So what's the problem? Well, for starters, the GOP front-runner declared in a 2006 interview with     <hyperlink>    CN8 that contraception was     <quotation>    and     <quotation>    That position is so obviously outside the mainstream of American culture that I suspect it will even lose him votes in Southern primaries next month.    <paragraph>   When the CN8 interview was conducted six years ago, Rick Santorum assured the interviewer that he would not allow his private beliefs on contraception to conflict with public policy. But that public-private divide was nowhere to be found when he gave an    <hyperlink>    interview to a Christian website in October 2011 (start watching 17:45 in).    <paragraph>   In the interview posted on Time's website, Santorum warned that contraceptives were dangerous to women and declared that     <quotation>   to use birth control. The current GOP front-runner went on to describe contraceptives as a license to engage in immoral acts and to     <quotation>       <paragraph>   These newly discovered interviews damage Rick Santorum's campaign in the same way President Obama's HHS ruling caused a temporary setback to the White House last week. That's because both the Obama and Santorum story lines fed into an existing narrative that concerns independent voters.    <paragraph>   All those who feared that Barack Obama was a big government liberal took no comfort from his showdown with a unified Catholic Church. Their claim that Washington was infringing on their religious liberties was a crisis in the making. But President Obama's ability to form an alliance with a group of progressive Catholics late in the week helped neutralize that issue for the White House. <paragraph>   Those who fear that Rick Santorum is an extremist on social issues will not have their fears assuaged by these two interviews. As Time's Michael Scherer points out in his post, 99% of American women have used contraceptives at one time in their life. And late this afternoon, women's groups began     <hyperlink>    attacking Santorum for statements made in these two interviews.    <paragraph>   Like President Obama, Mr. Santorum better put this contraceptive crisis behind him soon or Mitt Romney will avoid the Michigan Meltdown that many were predicting just this morning.
