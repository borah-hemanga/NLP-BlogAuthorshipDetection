10/31/12 5:33 AM EDT | Polls: Romney running out of time | New polls released by the New York Times and Quinnipiac today suggest that Mitt Romney is running out of time in his fight to win the White House. <paragraph> With President Obama maintaining his five-point lead in Ohio in today's poll, Romney must run the table on the six remaining swing states or expand the electoral map. Considering how rough the internals look in this morning's Ohio survey, Boston must know that winning the White House now depends on their candidate stealing Michigan, Minnesota or Pennsylvania out of the Obama column next Tuesday. Their play in those three Midwest states now appears to be more out of weakness than strength, though a new survey does put Romney within 3 points in Michigan.
