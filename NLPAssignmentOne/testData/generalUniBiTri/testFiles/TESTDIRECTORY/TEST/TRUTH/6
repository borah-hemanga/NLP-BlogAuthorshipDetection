4/23/12 9:57 PM EDT | Some liberals ask: What would Jerry do? |   <paragraph>  Since Jerry Falwell founded The Moral Majority in 1979, few things have unified American liberals as much as their contempt for self-righteous types who pushed a political agenda by attacking the faith of partisan opponents.  <paragraph>  For over a quarter of a century, left-wing thought leaders have roundly (and rightly) condemned those who self-righteously attacked political foes for their religious beliefs. In recent years, some on the right embarrassed themselves by questioning the faith of a president who publicly declared his faith in Jesus Christ as his Lord and personal savior.  <paragraph>  That is why it is so surprising that some supporters of the president are starting to attack Republicans based on religion. Mitt Romney's faith is now attacked on news networks and by liberal websites, suggesting that Mormonism is a cult and that Mitt Romney is heading for Hell. Others are claiming that Jesus Christ would be upset at the priorities laid out in the GOP House Budget for FY 2013. <paragraph>  What a joke.  <paragraph>  Supporters of the president would do better to focus on creating jobs than channeling Jesus. Their recent attacks make them look as pathetic as those conservatives who refuse to take President Obama's testimony at face value.
