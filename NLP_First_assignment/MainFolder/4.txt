The United States of Irrelevance |  <paragraph>   The award for the best campaign story of the day goes to a reporter who isn’t even on the election beat.  <paragraph>   Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for the New York Times, has a must-read about America’s shrinking electoral battleground, and the toxic effects of a system where the vast majority of states are ignored during presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> Liptak writes: “  In the razor-thin 1960 presidential election, John F. Kennedy campaigned in 49 states. Richard M. Nixon visited all 50. The current contest is just as close and intense, but the candidates have campaigned in only 10 states since the political conventions. There are towns in Ohio that have received more attention than the entire West Coast. The shrinking electoral battleground has altered the nature of American self-governance. There is evidence that the current system is depressing turnout, distorting policy, weakening accountability and effectively disenfranchising the vast majority of Americans. “It’s a new way to run a country,” says Bill Bishop, co-author of “The Big Sort,” a 2008 book that examined the most important cause of the trend: the recent tendency of like-minded people to live near one another. That demographic shift means the country is now dominated by solidly Democratic states on the coasts and solidly Republican ones in the interior and in much of the South. In a close election, all of those states are completely out of reach for one candidate or the other. ”   <paragraph>   The phenomenon Liptak writes about is well-known, but the figures he marshals – and the past landscape he chronicles -- are nevertheless eye-opening.  <paragraph>   In 1960 and 1976, for example, there were 30 contested states including California, Illinois, New York and Texas – in 1976, both California and Texas were decided by three percentage points or less. Today, all have been largely reduced to ATM machine status in presidential elections because the results are a foregone conclusion.  <paragraph>   The scene Liptak leads the story with, Nixon campaigning in all 50 states, is all but unthinkable today.  <paragraph>   One reason, of course, is that many believe Nixon’s pledge to visit every state might have cost him the 1960 election since he refused to forego an Alaska trip in the final days – it was time that would have been better spent in a state offering a bigger electoral vote haul.  <paragraph>   But, as Theodore White wrote in his groundbreaking work, The Making of the President 1960, Nixon’s rigorous and far-reaching schedule was a source of pride. “His press agents had already released the extent of his campaign in a statement: he had flown 65,500 miles, appeared in 188 cities at least once, made over 150 major speeches, and, they estimated, had been seen by 10,000,000 people in the flesh.”
Barone: Romney wins, handily |   <paragraph>   Michael Barone, a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner and co-author of the Almanac of American Politics,  <hyperlink> goes out on a limb and predicts victory for Mitt Romney – by a margin of nearly 100 electoral votes.  <paragraph>  “  Fundamentals usually prevail in American elections. That's bad news for Barack Obama. True, Americans want to think well of their presidents and many think it would be bad if Americans were perceived as rejecting the first black president. But it's also true that most voters oppose Obama's major policies and consider unsatisfactory the very sluggish economic recovery -- Friday's jobs report showed an unemployment uptick. Also, both national and target state polls show that independents, voters who don't identify themselves as Democrats or Republicans, break for Romney. That might not matter if Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 39 to 32 percent, as they did in the 2008 exit poll. But just about every indicator suggests that Republicans are more enthusiastic about voting -- and about their candidate -- than they were in 2008, and Democrats are less so… Bottom line: Romney 315, Obama 223. That sounds high for Romney. But he could drop Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and still win the election. Fundamentals. ”  <paragraph>   In Barone’s estimation, Romney essentially sweeps the swing states, with the exception of Nevada, and even picks up Pennsylvania.  <paragraph>   Michael’s views have drifted rightward over the years and he's become a prominent conservative voice, so there will be a tendency among Democrats to dismiss his prediction. But having worked closely with him in the past — we worked together to produce three Almanacs – I'd argue that no one in the business has a greater command of the American political landscape than Barone.  <paragraph>   Even so, I don’t see his sweep scenario playing out.  <paragraph>   It’s not as implausible as it seems given the tightness of the battleground state map, but it’s contingent on the notion that most pollsters are fundamentally misreading the composition of the electorate -- I'm not there yet. His Ohio and New Hampshire arguments also feel a little unconvincing to me. And my sense is that Pennsylvania and Michigan will move in tandem – probably for Obama, but together in any case.
PPP: Obama leads everywhere |   <paragraph>   The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling has come in for a great deal of criticism this year, mainly from Republicans questioning its motives and methodology.  <paragraph>   The prolific pollster regularly produces quality work, but its Democratic affiliations and occasionally suspect practices [  <hyperlink> here and   <hyperlink> here] have led Republicans to dismiss its findings in the same manner that Democrats dismiss Rasmussen polls as biased toward the GOP.  <paragraph>   Now, almost on cue, PPP has delivered a final series of state polls that puts President Barack Obama in the lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reports a 49-49 tie.  <paragraph>   Against the backdrop of a highly competitive election, the uniformity of those results — and the fact that PPP shows 5- to 6-point spreads in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — puts the firm out on a ledge. So when the final state outcomes are known, PPP figures to be one of the election’s biggest winners or losers, poised either to spike the football — or to explain what went wrong.
Swing state nailbiters |  <paragraph>   President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are within 2 percentage points of each other in 6 swing states, according to Friday’s RealClearPolitics state polling averages.  <paragraph>   In three of those battleground states – Colorado, Florida and Virginia -- the race is within a single percentage point. The spread in Iowa, New Hampshire and Ohio is between 2.0 and 2.4 points.  <paragraph>   The biggest swing state gap is in Wisconsin, where Obama has a 5 point edge.  <paragraph>   Michigan and Pennsylvania, two states where the level of competitiveness is disputed by Democrats, both host tighter races than Wisconsin, according to RCP.  <paragraph>   In Pennsylvania, where Romney will campaign Sunday and his running mate Paul Ryan will stump on Saturday, the difference is 4.6 points. In Michigan, the spread is 3.5 points.
W.Va. GOP: Stop Obama, vote straight ticket |  <paragraph>   In a state where President Obama is deeply unpopular and unlikely even to crack 40 percent on Election Day, the West Virginia Republican Party is urging voters to punish Democrats up and down the ballot, not just the president, by voting a straight Republican ticket. <paragraph>   From a West Virginia GOP email today: “ Saving West Virginia's future begins with marking just one box on your electronic voting machine or paper ballot. A straight Republican ticket ensures you won't vote for anyone who has ever supported Barack Obama. Period. That's the message from the West Virginia Republican Party…   Many elected Democrats claim not to agree with Obama on all issues, but they never stepped in to stop him. Most every Democrat in the State Legislature voted for versions of the ObamaCare bill  or local Cap & Trade. Governor Tomblin and his cronies on the state Board of Public Works have proven to be loyal allies or endorsers of the Obama administration. Senator Manchin and Rep. Rahall take their marching orders directly from the Obama White House. Mitt Romney can't help West Virginia coal unless we help ourselves by electing local leaders like Bill Maloney as Governor and sending John Raese and Rick Snuffer to fortify our team in Washington. ”  <paragraph>   West Virginia is one of a declining number of states — 15 in all — that enables straight ticket voting, which allows voters to select a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single punch or mark on the ballot.  <paragraph>   There’s no real pattern to the list of states that still permit the practice — they’re red and blue, big and small, and spread across the map. The beneficiaries of the practice aren’t entirely obvious either — it depends on the state.  <paragraph>   There’s some irony in the West Virginia GOP’s call for a straight ticket vote — for years, it’s worked to the benefit of local Democrats.  <paragraph>   Still, it’s probably safe to assume that if straight ticket voting is going to have a significant impact this year it’s going to be in states like West Virginia or Utah, where the presidential vote is likely to be lopsided.
Club to GOP: Define 'electable' | <paragraph>   In response to signals that the GOP establishment is prepared to play a more aggressive role in 2014 Senate primaries, Club for Growth President Chris Chocola fires a shot across the bow in    <hyperlink>    an op-ed published Wednesday.    <paragraph>   “ In the wake of some missed opportunities to pick up seats in the U.S. Senate over the last few cycles, one tactical change floated by the GOP establishment is that the party apparatus and its affiliated Super PACs should play a more influential role in primaries to make sure that more “electable” candidates are nominated.  It is hard to imagine a bigger mistake… Everyone wants to avoid the next Todd Akin or Christine O’Donnell, neither of whom received any support from the Club for Growth PAC. But the Republican establishment has a horrendous track record of accurately identifying which candidates are truly unelectable and which are not. Too often, party insiders mistakenly substitute the word “unelectable” for the word “conservative.” ”     <paragraph>   Chocola, a former GOP congressman from Indiana, points to a litany of top, establishment-favored candidates who lost in 2012 and also to a rogue’s gallery of so-called ‘electable’ GOP House and Senate candidates who backfired in spectacular fashion in recent years: Dede Scozzafava, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist.     <paragraph>   The venue for the op-ed is notable – the Kansas City Star, a Missouri-based paper with a big circulation in the backyards of Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, the incoming National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt.     <paragraph>   Blunt, a member of Senate leadership, and Moran both     <hyperlink>    expressed support – however gingerly -- for the notion of greater national involvement in interviews with POLITICO’s Manu Raju last week.     <paragraph>   Chocola’s message is a reminder that even the sweeping 2012 Senate losses haven’t resolved the intra-party conflicts that cost the GOP a handful of seats in the last two election cycles.     <paragraph>   With the possibility of several primary challenges to GOP incumbents in 2014, as well as a handful of other attractive Democratic-held seats that could generate contentious GOP primaries, the balance struck between the national party and groups like CFG will likely determine whether or not the GOP has a shot at winning back the majority.
Allen West's cautionary tale |  <paragraph>   If you’re wondering how a member of Congress could raise more than $17 million for his reelection bid and still lose, read Alex Isenstadt’s     <hyperlink>    excellent post-mortem on GOP Rep. Allen West’s defeat.    <paragraph>   Alex reports that West had sky-high name ID, a Republican-leaning district, an inexperienced 29-year-old Democratic foe and an election eve lead in his internal polling but still fell short in the end.    <paragraph>   It’s a cautionary tale, not for the average House member but for political provocateurs like West. In his case, he learned the hard way that the iron laws of politics apply even to congressmen with a national base of support.    <paragraph>   His outspoken and over-the-top style, it seems, was out of sync with the locals in his highly competitive district — and he didn’t dial it down in the face of a tough reelection race. Top of the ticket performance was also a problem since President Obama goosed Democratic turnout in his south Florida seat.    <paragraph>   West’s Republican colleagues in Tallahassee didn’t exactly have his back, either. As a relative newcomer to politics, and with his eye fixed on Washington, West lacked relationships in the GOP-controlled state capital that might have resulted in a safer district from redistricting.    <paragraph>   It’s unlikely that we’ve heard the last of West, however. As Alex notes, cable news will still find him an attractive guest. And with his national following and proven fundraising talent — he raised at least $23 million in his two congressional races, a stunning amount for a House candidate — he would be a competitive candidate for any office he sought.    <paragraph>   There’s even a comeback model for lightning-rod pols like West.    <paragraph>   Just a few hours up the road, Democrat Alan Grayson returned to Congress this year after suffering a fate similar to West in 2010. Like West, Grayson’s brand of combative and outspoken liberalism was a mismatch for his more temperate Orlando district.    <paragraph>   But with his prolific fundraising and base of support he was able to jump on his first opportunity to return to Congress, when a new, heavily Democratic seat opened after redistricting. No one bothered to challenge him in the Democratic primary and Grayson won in a November cakewalk.
Richard Mourdock, party buzzkill |         <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   In what’s shaping up to a good Republican year in Indiana — Mitt Romney is likely to carry the state, Mike Pence is likely to win the governorship and both legislative chambers figure to remain in GOP control — GOP Senate nominee Richard Mourdock’s candidacy has turned out to be a discordant note.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    The Evansville Courier & Press reports on a marked difference in the reactions to the top of the ticket nominees at the Indiana GOP fall dinner Monday.  <paragraph>   “ However, at the Indiana Republican Party's fall dinner at the Ritz Charles in Carmel on Monday night, enthusiasm for Mourdock's candidacy was measured compared to the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Mike Pence. Some of the hundreds in attendance — mostly women — remained sitting during an ovation for Mourdock and then stood eagerly for Pence. Several Republicans who attended said the reaction was the same at a reception before the dinner.    <paragraph>   Mike McDaniel, the former Indiana Republican Party chairman, said he believes the candidacies of Pence and Mitt Romney will buoy Mourdock — but that the comments on rape and abortion did some damage.    <paragraph>    Those are comments that he knows he wishes he had back, and yeah, they made it closer,  McDaniel said.  I think all the momentum was going in his direction, and that put a screech on that.  ”    <paragraph>   Fortunately for Mourdock, top Indiana Republicans haven’t abandoned his candidacy — in part because of what they see as the over-the-top ferocity of the ensuing Democratic attacks against him.    <paragraph>   If he manages to pull out a victory, he’ll still have some serious fence-mending to do if he hopes to be effective in the Senate. Even if Mourdock had never made his comments about pregnancies caused by rape, it would have taken some time for him to win over Republicans who still nurse grievances left from his primary victory over veteran Sen. Dick Lugar. On top of that, he would arrive in Washington far more politically radioactive than the typical freshman senator.
Hurricane Sandy: The political fallout |       <paragraph>     <picture>  <paragraph>   The widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy is going to have an effect on Election Day. The only question is how far-reaching it’s going to be. While some states escaped with far less damage than they feared, as many as 8.5 million residents across the Northeast were without power Tuesday — and a portion of them faced the prospect of an extended period of time without electricity.    <paragraph>   Here are six things to watch in assessing the storm’s political fallout:    <paragraph>   The popular vote The storm’s path along the Eastern Seaboard ripped across a wide swath of blue state America. The list of hardest hit states includes many of the states expected to deliver the biggest victory margins for the president this year — among them New York, which delivered a 2 million vote winning margin to President Obama in 2008.    <paragraph>   While the extent to which elections will be disrupted next week is unclear, the extensive power outages, flooding and wreckage from North Carolina to Maine are certain to have an impact on campaign ground games and could work to depress voter turnout in some places.    <paragraph>   That shouldn’t affect the electoral vote — New York, for example, will still deliver its 29 electoral votes to Barack Obama regardless of the damage to lower Manhattan — but in an exceptionally tight election, lower turnout in the most Democratic states increases the odds of a scenario where Obama wins the Electoral College but loses the popular vote.    <paragraph>   The Senate map The storm’s path cut through a handful of states with some of this year’s closest Senate races — among them Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia.    <paragraph>   While the Connecticut and Virginia races are open seat contests, Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown and Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey are running for reelection. As their home states begin the process of recovery, both incumbents have unique opportunities for free media and to connect with constituents — in an official capacity — at a time when many will be in need of local and federal assistance.    <paragraph>   The House map New York, which has suffered the highest death toll and where 2.3 million households were without power Tuesday, is one the prime House battlegrounds this year. There are as many as eight competitive races, most of them located south of Albany, where the bulk of the power outages have occurred.    <paragraph>   In New Hampshire, where the state’s two Republican incumbents are in danger of losing their seats, the state remains under a flood watch. But the Union Leader reported that “state utility regulators expect power companies to have all electricity restored by the end of the week, well before Tuesday’s general election.”    <paragraph>   The 2016ers Any number of the nation’s governors  or mayors  can attest to the leadership challenges of natural disasters and the powerful effect they can have on approval ratings — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is among those who experienced a post-hurricane spike in popularity after Hurricane Irene.    <paragraph>   The path of Hurricane Sandy means it will test a handful of governors with prospects beyond their home states — Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.    <paragraph>   With the nation watching, how they respond will go a long way toward establishing their home state narrative. But it will also provide a first impression to many voters outside their states whose introduction to them comes solely through glimpses of interviews and press conferences on cable and broadcast news.    <paragraph>   Maine’s electoral vote Maine is one of two states  the other is Nebraska  that allocates its electoral votes by congressional district. While the statewide vote is firmly in the Obama camp, local Republicans believe one of its two congressional districts is within Mitt Romney’s reach — raising the possibility that the GOP nominee could capture one of the state’s four electoral votes.     <paragraph>   It’s a longshot, for sure. But it’s worth noting that the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future recently reserved a significant amount of airtime in Maine television markets. While much of that was in the Portland market — and thus designed to bleed into New Hampshire — the buy also covered the northern-based 2nd District, which is where the GOP sees its opportunity.     <paragraph>   As a whole, the state was largely spared the worst of the storm’s damage. But the aftereffects of the storm were not evenly distributed — at least 60,000 customers were without power Tuesday afternoon, the bulk of them in the Portland area, not in the expansive 2nd District. It could very well mean nothing. But anything that could alter the equation in Maine in the final week of the campaign is worth keeping an eye on.     <paragraph>   A leadership test for incumbents If we’ve learned anything about the politics of natural disasters, it’s that careers can be made and unmade in the preparations and aftermath.    <paragraph>   Snowstorms, hurricanes, flooding, wildfires — they offer rare, unfiltered opportunities for elected officials to prove their mettle under pressure, and at a time of great need.    <paragraph>   The experiences of the Bush family alone sketch out the range of political consequences.    <paragraph>   In August 1992, FEMA’s disjointed response to the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew took its toll on President George H.W. Bush’s standing in Florida, which he managed to carry narrowly that fall but by a dramatically reduced margin over 1988. After three consecutive blowout GOP presidential wins there, Bush scraped to victory by just 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 39 percent — a 20-point GOP drop since 1988.    <paragraph>   His son Jeb Bush, the former two-term Florida governor, learned from the experience. His own hurricane preparation and relief efforts — 8 major storms hit the state in 2004 and 2005 — helped burnish his own reputation as a chief executive and bolster his popularity.    <paragraph>   Jeb Bush’s brother, President George W. Bush, failed to hit the same high mark as president. While his own Florida hurricane response efforts in 2004 were well received, his presidency never recovered from the administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
Register endorsement arrives late |  <paragraph>   As one of the great papers in presidential politics — and one of     <hyperlink>    four major Iowa newspapers to endorse Mitt Romney on Sunday — it's understandable that the Des Moines Register's endorsement would cause a     <hyperlink>    stir this weekend.   <paragraph>   But the impact of the paper’s decision, in terms of persuading voters, is likely limited. <paragraph>   It's not that the Register's endorsement doesn't matter. Rather, roughly a quarter of the state’s vote has already been cast.    <paragraph>   According to figures     <hyperlink>    released Friday by the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, 423,586 absentee votes have already been received. That represents 27 percent of the total votes cast in 2008.   <paragraph>   The late-in-the-campaign endorsements in Iowa and elsewhere suggest that many newspapers haven’t yet accounted for the dramatic growth in the percentage of early voting across the nation. In some states, for example, more than one-third of the vote has already been cast.  <paragraph>   The United States Election Project     <hyperlink>    estimates that, through Sunday, 13.8 million ballots have been cast in all reporting jurisdiction — roughly 10 percent of the total votes cast in the 2008 presidential election.
Sliming the Supreme Court |   <paragraph>  I love Bobby Knight. The former Indiana basketball coaching legend used to run up and down the sidelines screaming at shrinking referees in hopes of having the next call go his way.  <paragraph>  The New York Times' editorial page is now doing their best Bobby Knight imitation in covering the Supreme Court in a way that matches the former Hoosier's red-faced rage insult by insult.  <paragraph>  In this case, the intended target is Justice Anthony Kennedy instead of a poor, shriveled-up referee. The Times knows that with the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Kennedy is the only member left on the Court who can be swayed by such non-germane items as New York Times editorials.  <paragraph>  Understanding the breadth of their power, the editorial page editors decided to use their Sunday space  <hyperlink>  to personally attack any Supreme Court justice who had the temerity to raise questions during last week's oral arguments. Those who did were blasted by the editorial page as  sidestepping the Constitution  and being  virtually unfettered by the law.   <paragraph>  In the same editorial, the Times labeled the four liberal justices as  moderates  who  see their role as stewards of the law, balancing the responsibility to enforce the Constitution through judicial review against the duty to show deference to the will of the political branches.   <paragraph>  Excuse me for a moment while I go throw up… OK. I'm back.  <paragraph>  The Times’ description of the  moderates  is laughable at best.  <paragraph>  Their voting patterns are every bit as predictably liberal as Scalia, Thomas, Roberts and Alito line up as a conservative block.  In this particular case, the Times’ description of the Court's left wing voting block is particularly hilarious considering that one of those impartial  stewards of the law  was sending euphoric emails to liberal law professor Larry Tribe during the passage of the very law that she will now judge.  <paragraph>  Maureen Dowd went Full-Bobby with   <hyperlink>  her rant against the Court, attacking them as  hacks  who are  cosseted behind white marble pillars.  Dowd goes on to say, the Court is  out of reach of TV,”  accountable to no one  and  the most divisive in modern American history.  <paragraph>  Maureen slimed Justice Scalia as  venomous,  called Chief Justice Roberts  a crimson partisan  and dismissed Justice Alito as being  insufferable.   <paragraph>  But then Coach Dowd clumsily showed her hand when she ended the column by declaring that the  dream of expanded health care  was now resting in the hands of Anthony Kennedy.  <paragraph>  Will Justice Kennedy be influenced by the all-too-obvious gamesmanship of the Times editorial page? I doubt it. I'm fairly sure the Times  and the president  overplayed their hands and somehow succeeded in making the justices look sympathetic.  <paragraph>  As the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger wrote today, “Most legal commentary has said the president's attack is likely to anger the justices, perhaps including some of the Court's liberals.   <paragraph>  I suspect Henninger is right. Even Bobby Knight knew that spewing personal insults and throwing chairs at refs backfires more often than not.
From tea party to tepid |   <paragraph>  Absent a political earthquake, the GOP nomination outcome is set in stone. Willard Mitt Romney will be the Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012. And just as the red hot Republican Revolution of 1994 was followed by Bob Dole's ascension in 1996, the Tea Party Uprising of 2010 is being followed by the nomination of Obamacare's ideological architect.  <paragraph>  Regardless, the fat lady has sung. As conservative talker Hugh Hewitt declared on National Review Online last night,  The race for the GOP nomination is still over.   <paragraph>  University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato, writing for NRO's  The Corner  said this: <paragraph>   Santorum has earned another run in 2016 or 2020. But it is three long weeks until the next set of primaries. He is guaranteed to lose four of five contests on that day, and he may even lose the delegate battle in Pennsylvania — a potentially crippling embarrassment for his future plans. Santorum has no real chance to stop Romney and may squander the admiration he has won in the GOP base.  <paragraph>  Too bad Mitt Romney's opponents are walking around like Bruce Willis in  The Sixth Sense.  As former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford noted in a column for Fox News, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are not swayed by political logic or delegate math.  <paragraph>   Mathematical certainties at this point mean nothing to Gingrich and have never meant anything to Santorum. If they did, Santorum would never have entered the race in the first place.   <paragraph>  As for Gingrich, the statement he released after last night's losses suggest the former speaker is planning to continue his fight all the way though Tampa.  <paragraph>  “Our party must commit itself to a bold, conservative platform. We cannot win on an etch-a-sketch platform that shows no principle or backbone.”  <paragraph>  And the beat goes on....
Let Mitt be Mitt... and dull |   <paragraph>  Mike Allen and Evan Thomas'  Inside the Circus  reveals that Mitt Romney's campaign team is still trying to figure out how to make their emotionally remote and fabulously wealthy candidate connect with voters.  <paragraph>  Team Romney has spent the past month or so trying to humanize their candidate with mostly disastrous results. Romney's poll numbers have taken a dive and his consistently poor performances have spooked conservatives like myself who can't believe this is the best the GOP has to offer after four years of Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Although he's a lousy politician, everyone who knows Mitt personally sees him as a great father, a devoted husband and a gifted businessman. If you spend a few minutes with the man's family, you can see his character shining through in his wife and five boys. But being a good man has not always translated well on the campaign trail. Perhaps this is because the business of politics is such an inhumane slog that only the craziest among us can look like normal human beings while going through the grind of a presidential election.  <paragraph>  Mitt can't fake it. He stinks at politicking. But then again, so did many others who would later succeed at governing. If Boston wants their candidate to humanize himself, maybe they should just let him admit that fact and stop trying to stuff himself into a suit that doesn't fit.  <paragraph>  So what should Mitt Romney tell Americans when he stops joking about his father shutting down plants or when he stops pretending to be a fan of  The Hunger Games ? Maybe he could start with the truth about himself.  <paragraph>  Mr. Romney should begin by talking about the proud legacy that his father passed along, the lessons he learned from a dad who began his life with little and ended up a legend in Michigan business and history.  <paragraph>  Then Mitt Romney should brag about starting a company that was wildly successful in turning businesses around, repairing failing companies and creating big profits for senior citizens, colleges, public unions, 401 k s and anyone else smart enough to bet on Romney's company.  <paragraph>  Romney could then brag about leaving Wall Street to take on Teddy Kennedy in the Liberal Lion's own back yard. He should also admit to lurching a bit too much to the left while assuring conservatives that he will never make that mistake again.  <paragraph>  Team Romney should also remind voters that he saved the 2002 Olympics, not because he knew how to tell jokes or play  man of the people,  but because Mitt Romney was born to fix things that are broken - like the U.S. economy in 2012. <paragraph>  Romney should then tell Americans how he was elected governor of one of the most liberal states in America despite being a conservative Mormon. Romney further succeeded politically when he managed to pull the Democratic legislature of Massachusetts as far right as politically possible. If President Romney is forced one day to govern with Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid, he can promise Americans that he will be more prepared to lead a divided nation than a certain former state legislator who voted present on the same kind of tough votes that required Governor Romney to build a majority.  <paragraph>  Mitt Romney should then just admit the sad truth. He's stiff. He's boring. He looks plain uncomfortable every time he tries to be cool. And despite what the love of his life may believe, he has never been the life of any party. But he may be the only leader on the national stage who has what it takes to fix an economy that's deep in debt, bleeding jobs by the year and suffering through 30 years of decline.  <paragraph>  Now is not the time to tell jokes. Now is the time to lead. So Mitt Romney, lead. And leave the bad jokes to Jay Leno.
The politics of justice |  <paragraph>  At the beginning of this week's momentous Supreme Court arguments, allies of the Affordable Health Care Act were predicting a rout for their side. Judicial experts even told the New York Times  and Morning Joe  that they would not be surprised if the White House won the case by an 8-1 vote.  <paragraph>  Much has changed since Monday. Now many expect the Supreme Court to strike down the individual mandate and possibly throw out the entire law. But just as I was skeptical when liberals were overconfident at the beginning of the week, I find it equally unrealistic for conservatives to expect to be given a clear cut victory.  <paragraph>  I still expect this case to come down to Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote. And while Kennedy gave conservatives the question of the week   Can you create commerce in order to regulate it?  , the moderate justice's history shows how hard it is to define his judicial philosophy.  <paragraph>  Court observers have long accused Kennedy of being influenced by what Federal Judge Lawrence Silberman once famously called the  Greenhouse Effect,  a term coined to describe conservatives who compromise their principles in exchange for fawning press coverage from the New York Times--named in honor of former Times reporter Linda Greenhouse.  <paragraph>  The phenomenon of  playing to the crowds  has been in decline in recent years, with the court settling into a more ideologically predictable routine.  <paragraph>  Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito follow a more  conservative  line and do not give a damn what the New York Times editorial page has to say. The same can be said of Ginsburg, Kagan, Breyer and Sotomayor, who can be pigeonholed more often than not in the  liberal  camp.  <paragraph>  These days, only Anthony Kennedy moves freely across the political divide, and critics say he often does so with an eye less on the law before him than on his longterm legacy.  <paragraph>  One of the worst examples of the Supreme Court taking political considerations into their legal decisions came in the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where Anthony Kennedy and two other justices admitted as much in their decision.  <paragraph>  Writing for the three judge plurality, Sandra Day O'Connor based her decision to uphold Roe v. Wade on the assertion that women now relied on abortion so much that to allow states to regulate it in a restrictive manner would create chaos. Even more disturbing was O'Connor and Kennedy's bizarre claim that upholding Roe was required if the Court hoped to protect its institutional legitimacy.  <paragraph>  The Court wrote,  Overruling Roe v. Wade in response to [the] divisiveness of [the] abortion issue would address error, if error there was, at cost of profound and unnecessary damage to [the] Supreme Court's legitimacy.   <paragraph>  As Notre Dame professor of law O. Carter Snead told me earlier this week, legal commentators across the ideological spectrum denounced the ruling as an abrogation of judicial authority without even the pretense of sound constitutional reasoning.  <paragraph>  That Kennedy and O'Connor would admit in a Supreme Court decision that they feared reversing constitutional error because of political recriminations should be shocking to even the most casual observer of the Court.  <paragraph>  Why does this matter now? Because the only lesson Anthony Kennedy has learned from Casey is that one should not admit publicly to caring more about political considerations than constitutional law.  <paragraph>  For the moment, conservatives can count themselves lucky that 67% of Americans want the Court to overturn the President's health care law. But if those numbers change as its repeal begins to look more likely, Anthony Kennedy may start looking for guidance from the crowds and the New York Times editorial page. When that happens, all legal reasoning takes a back seat to pure politics.
Not conservative enough |   <paragraph>  In the  <hyperlink>  New York Times this Sunday, author Kevin Baker echoed the sentiment of most in the mainstream media that the Republican Party's biggest problem over the past few years has been a lurch to the right. When you judge the party by its bottom line, the fact is that the GOP has not been conservative enough.  <paragraph>  What is too conservative about spending the past decade doubling the national debt?   <paragraph>  How is an unpaid for $7 trillion Medicare expansion a run to the right?  <paragraph>  Will most historians look back on a party who promised to end tyranny across the globe, use American troops as the world's 9-1-1 and engage in nation building on an unprecedented level consider Bush Republicans too conservative or too Wilsonian? Don't waste your time answering. The verdict is obvious. <paragraph>  And for all the weeping and gnashing of teeth I have had to endure over the radicalism of this tea party Congress, to my worried liberal friends I say “take a valium and relax.” This right wing, radical, reactionary tea party crew has meekly gone along with their statist party leaders far too often for my tastes. As a result, they added $1 trillion to the national debt their first year in power and got outmaneuvered by President Barack Obama at every turn.  <paragraph>  Too many in the media  and the conservative movement  have been distracted by stupid statements that have been streaming out of a few Republicans' mouths instead of keeping their eyes on the bottom line. When you focus on the one issue that really matters -- individual freedom vs. state expansion -- the GOP fails every test on true, blue conservatism.   <paragraph>  And now the party is in the process of nominating the man who was the architect of Obama's health care law.   <paragraph>  Too conservative? Actually, not conservative enough.   <paragraph>    <video> See my video blog below on the topic 
Why Romney's Dixie drought could doom the GOP |  <paragraph>   Many are discounting Rick Santorum's big win in Louisiana last night as too little too late. Perhaps they should take a second look.  <paragraph>   The former Pennsylvania senator almost beat the front-runner by a two-to-one margin, reeling in almost 50 percent of the vote in a four-person race. More important to Republicans who want to win the White House this fall is the continued weakness Massachusetts' Mitt Romney is showing in the South.   <paragraph>   Romney's performance south of the Mason-Dixon line has been pathetic. Despite having all the money, organization and endorsements that matter, Romney finished third in Alabama, third in Mississippi and a distant second in Louisiana. He was stomped by Newt Gingrich by an average of 20 points in South Carolina and Georgia and had his 13 worst performances in 2008 in the Deep South.  <paragraph>   There was a time when the South was solidly Republican but those days are gone. Barack Obama won Virginia and North Carolina four years ago and came close to beating John McCain in Georgia. Bill Clinton beat George Bush in Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia.  <paragraph>   Romney's continued weakness in the Heart of Dixie spells trouble for the GOP this fall. The only question is whether it will take a Santorum win in Wisconsin to refocus Republican minds on the unassailable fact that GOP presidential candidates cannot win unless they have the support of rock-ribbed conservatives. Mitt Romney does not, and that is becoming clearer by the day in this painful primary season.
Is Romney's fate Kristol clear? |  <paragraph>   While you were sleeping last night, most commentators called the GOP presidential fight for Methodical Mitt. Last night's win in Illinois was one of the cleaner victories for Team Romney though University of Virginia's Larry Sabato commented that it was  amusing to see pundits declare the Illinois primary a game-changer when it's the kind of state Romney should carry.     <paragraph>   Still, Sabato and others on National Review's Symposium posted early this morning concluded that the Republican race was all but over.    <paragraph>   Hugh Hewitt wrote that  unless a meteor hits the campaign bus, it is Obama vs. Romney in the fall, a race the former Massachusetts governor can win.     <paragraph>   The National Review's Jim Geraghty said  It's not quite over…but it's effectively over.     <paragraph>   Time Magazine's Mark Halperin called the race for Romney. And given an April calendar that favors Mitt and the fundraising shortcomings of the other candidates, Mark may be right.    <paragraph>   Still, hope springs eternal for those hoping for a conservative knight in shining armor to emerge from Tampa, though some of us are starting to sound like Japanese soldiers burrowed into Pacific islands ready to fight a battle whose outcome is already determined.    <paragraph>   But don't expect Bill Kristol to march meekly behind the Republican Party's flawed front runner.    <paragraph>   This morning, Kristol told readers why Mitt Romney may have won the battle but conservatives are likely to lose the political war this fall with Barack Obama.    <paragraph>    Watching Mitt Romney's victory speech in Illinois didn't reassure me about his chances against President Obama. His victory seems likely  but still not inevitable! , But if he sticks with this core message, we'd better hope Republicans and independents are really determined to get rid of Barack Obama.     <paragraph>   Put me in the Kristol camp. Faced with the historic opportunity to retain the House, take the Senate, win the White House and reshape the Supreme Court for a generation, the Republican Party seems destined to nominate a candidate they do not even like.
Finding common ground on education reform | <paragraph>   The reaction to our education town hall meeting held this morning in Ft. Lee, N.J., has been overwhelmingly positive. It was great to talk about education reform in a state where Newark's Democratic mayor, New Jersey's Republican governor and the country's Democratic president all consider themselves on the same side of reform.    <paragraph>   This  dogs and cats living together  moment was made more evident when Gov. Chris Christie began saying nice things about Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy's education team. The fact that Christie and Malloy spent much of last year fighting each other in the press made their kind words about each other all the more hopeful today. Other  odd couples  who found common ground today were American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and Harlem Village Academies CEO Deborah Kenny, as well as former DNC chairman Howard Dean and former D.C. schools superintendent Michelle Rhee.    <paragraph>   Today's Morning Joe town hall meeting on education showed that reforming America's schools may be one political cause that brings all sides together. And judging from today's conversations on Morning Joe, the left and right are moving closer together every day.    <paragraph>   To see video from this morning's town hall, head to    <hyperlink>    joe.msnbc.com.    <paragraph>   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misspelled Deborah Kenny's name.
A reporter's notebook... |  <paragraph>   To better serve you, the dedicated POLITICO blog reader, I travel the globe regularly to grasp the challenges facing other countries in hopes of improving our own. Like Thomas Friedman, David Ignatius and Nick Kristof, I know the big story never lands on a newsroom desk. That is why this weekend, I went on assignment in the most trying of circumstances.  <paragraph>   After arriving at the Lanesborough Hotel in Knightsbridge, London, I dug right in to my assignment despite the challenging surroundings. After having to call the butler TWICE to get the right Visconti pen to begin this posting, I soon became bored at the thought of writing anything so I ordered  Old School  on TV and called it a night.    <paragraph>   The next morning I began my journalistic journey in earnest and began studying the current British economic crisis, Prime Minister Cameron's response to that crisis, and how the Chancellor of the Exchequer's austerity program has impacted disposable income -- specifically, among English scousers who are also soccer fans. From the outset of my trip, I had hoped to challenge the preposterous assumption  repeated by absolutely nobody that I know  that the British economy is so bad that even rabid fans from Northern England would fail to make this weekend's trip to Wembley to see Liverpool win the League Cup in glorious style.  <paragraph>   Happily, my brutish slog across the pond was rewarded by the accumulation of massive evidence that British pensioners continue to spend their money on life's basics -- kegs of Carlsberg, graphic tattoos and overpriced futbol tickets. I even considered, albeit briefly, leaving my luxury box to interview the teeming masses but thought the better of it. Instead, I picked up a paper on the way to Heathrow this morning and was surprised by how closely the     <hyperlink>    current British crisis parallels our own. <paragraph>   “ In a stark warning ahead of next month’s Budget, the Chancellor said there was little the Coalition could do to stimulate the economy.  <paragraph>   Mr. Osborne’s bleak assessment echoes that of Liam Byrne, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, who bluntly joked that Labour had left Britain broke when he exited the Government in 2010.  He left David Laws, his successor, a one-line note saying: “Dear Chief Secretary, I’m afraid to tell you there’s no money left.” <paragraph>    The British Government has run out of money because all the money was spent in the good years,” the Chancellor said. “The money and the investment and the jobs need to come from the private sector.” ”   <paragraph>   Whoever wins the 2012 election will be faced with the same reality when they are sworn in the following January. But the question for historians is whether this global economic crisis will be solved by President Obama's trillion dollar deficits or by Prime Minister Cameron's austere approach.  <paragraph>   My money is on Cameron. But at this point in the crisis, politicians on both sides of the political divide -- and on both sides of the Atlantic -- are whistling past graveyards. As the famous Hollywood saying goes,  Nobody knows nothing. 
Just your average, run of the mill blog on state-sanctioned vaginal probes | <paragraph>   Great news out of Richmond, VA for Republicans who actually like winning general elections. Late word today that Governor     <hyperlink>    Bob McDonnell has effectively killed a bill that would have sanctioned state-ordered vaginal probes for women seeking to engage in a legal activity.  <paragraph>   This afternoon the Governor released the following statement: “Mandating an invasive procedure in order to give informed consent is not a proper role for the state. No person should be directed to undergo an invasive procedure by the state, without their consent, as a precondition to another medical procedure.”   <paragraph>   Regardless of your position on abortion, Bob McDonnell's move makes it more likely that Republicans can take the state out of Barack Obama's column this fall. It also keeps the Virginia governor in the running for VP.  <paragraph>   No word yet on whether Virginia's GOP legislators will now attempt to alienate the rest of the Commonwealth's voters by ordering state-sanctioned anal probes for men seeking public funding for their Viagra supplies.
A pollster under oath | <paragraph>  This post has been updated. See below.  <paragraph>  When a pollster or strategist for a struggling political campaign presents what seems like a sugar-coated view of his candidate's chances, do you ever think: I wish I could give that adviser some truth serum, or maybe put him under oath? <paragraph>  Well, truth serum may be pushing it, but the put-him-under-oath part has actually happened. And when a pollster is required to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, under penalty of perjury, what emerges is quite a bit different than what you hear in the waning days of a presidential campaign.  <paragraph>  In May, the pollster for   <hyperlink> Al Gore's presidential bid in 2000 and John Edwards's in 2004 and 2008, Harrison Hickman, took the stand in the federal criminal case against Edwards over alleged campaign finance violations stemming from payments to support Edwards's mistress.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> See also: PHOTOS: John Edwards on trial   <paragraph>  Under oath, Hickman admitted that in the final weeks of Edwards's 2008 bid, Hickman cherry-picked public polls to make the candidate seem viable, promoted surveys that Hickman considered unreliable, and sent e-mails to campaign aides, Edwards supporters and reporters which argued that the former senator was still in the hunt —even though Hickman had already told   <hyperlink> Edwards privately that he had no real chance of winning the Democratic nomination.  <paragraph>   They were pounding on me for positive information. You know, where is some good news we can share with people? We were monitoring all these polls and I was sending the ones that were most favorable because [campaign aides] wanted to share them with reporters,  Hickman testified on May 14 at the trial in Greensboro, N.C.  We were not finding very much good news and I was trying to give them what I could find.   <paragraph>  Hickman testified that when circulating the polls, he didn't much care if they were accurate.  I didn't necessarily take any of these as for—as you would say, for the truth of the matter. I took them more as something that could be used as propaganda for the campaign,  the veteran pollster said.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: The parallel universe where Mitt Romney leads all polls   <paragraph>  Edwards's viability from late 2007 through January 2008 was a hotly disputed issue at his trial because federal prosecutors were seeking to prove that nearly $1 million in expenses Edwards backers paid for his mistress in and around that time frame amounted to donations to advance his bid for the presidency. Edwards's defense contended that his inner circle viewed his prospects of winning the presidency as zero or close to it, once Sen. Barack Obama's juggernaut gathered steam, so the payments must have been made out of personal affection for Edwards or for some other reason unrelated to the presidential campaign.  <paragraph>  However, Hickman's testimony also opened a rare window into the way major presidential campaigns try to use polling numbers to spin the press and laid bare the fact that top campaign operatives sometimes propound a version of the truth starkly at odds with what they themselves believe.  <paragraph>  Hickman, called by the former senator's defense, testified that he told Edwards in  early to middle of November 2007,  that the campaign wasn't going to succeed.  <paragraph>   I told him that the odds were overwhelming that we were not going—that he was not going to be the nominee for president. I mean, we talked about a variety of things might change, do differently, and all that, but none of them translated into winning the nomination,  the pollster told Edwards attorney Alan Duncan.  <paragraph>  However, under cross-examination by lead prosecutor David Harbach, Hickman acknowledged sending a series of emails in November and December, and even into January, endorsing or promoting polls that made Edwards look good. Asked about what appeared to be   <hyperlink> a New York Times CBS poll released in mid-November showing an effective  three-way tie  in Iowa with Hillary Clinton at 25 percent, Edwards at 23 percent and Obama at 22 percent, Hickman acknowledged he circulated it but insisted he didn't think it was correct.  <paragraph>   The business I'm in is a business any fool can get into, and a lot can happen. I'm sure there was a poll like that,  the folksy Hickman told jurors when first asked about a poll showing the race tied.  I kept up with every poll that was done, including our own, and there may have been a few that showed them a tie, but... that's not really what my analysis is. Campaigns are about trajectory, and... there could have been a point at which it was a tie in the sense that we were coming down, and Obama was going up, and Clinton was going up.   <paragraph>  Hickman also indicated that senior campaign staffers knew many of the polls were poorly done and of little value.  We didn't take these dog and cat and baby-sitter polls seriously,  he said.  <paragraph>  Hickman acknowledged that on January 2, 2008, a day before the Iowa caucuses, he sent out a summary of nine post-Christmas Iowa polls showing Edwards in contention in the Hawkeye State. However, he testified two-thirds of them were from firms he considered  ones we typically would not put a lot of credence in.  Hickman put Mason-Dixon, Strategic Vision, Insider Advantage, Zogby and Research 2000 in the  less reputable  group. He also told the court that ARG polls  have a miserable track record.   <paragraph>     <hyperlink> See also: POLITICO polling center   <paragraph>  Hickman said he considered the Des Moines Register polls, CNN and Los Angeles Times polls more accurate.  A full transcript of his testimony is posted   <hyperlink> here.   <paragraph>  The prosecutor was clearly trying to suggest that Edwards was more viable than Hickman, a longtime friend of the ex-senator, admitted in his initial testimony. Harbach may have even been trying to suggest that Hickman's basic credibility was impugned by the heavy spin he acknowledged offering late in the 2008 primary campaign. However, the line of questioning was baffling to reporters in the courtroom who seemed not at all surprised that a campaign would insist on its viability until moments before the candidate dropped out or lost. <paragraph>  In short, to many journalists, what Hickman admitted doing in late 2007 and 2008 was no more a sign of bad character than an actor spinning a yarn on stage during a play or a lawyer mounting an implausible defense for a clearly guilty client.  <paragraph>  When the defense got to question Hickman again, he was unapologetic about what he termed an effort to  keep up morale  among Edwards backers and aides.  <paragraph>   They were being inundated with bad news. I didn't have to give them bad news. I was trying to pick out morsels, you know, acorns. Out of a big stack of acorns, I was trying to pick out a few good ones that they could pass along to other people, you know, to keep them working,  Hickman testified.  I mean, I wasn't going to say, you know, all hope is lost, you know, take a couple of weeks off. I mean, that was not the object of it. I mean, the object was to keep going as hard as we could. And we all worked as hard as we could. I mean, the working hard and promoting the candidacy are independent, in my mind, to the evaluation of what the likely outcome is.   <paragraph>  Asked if what he did to that end in the 2008 race was at all unusual when compared with other contests, Hickman told Duncan:  No. No. I did -- you know, I did what I was supposed to do…. I did my job the way I've always done my job.   <paragraph>  While the discussion of polling and the legitimate bounds of spin did offer an unusual behind-the-scenes look at a major presidential campaign, it's not at all clear that it had any impact on the outcome of the case against Edwards. Indeed, U.S. District Court Judge Catherine Eagles at one point admonished Hickman and Duncan that the grad-school polling seminar seemed pretty tangential to anything jurors were being asked to consider.  <paragraph>   I don't think we need quite this much detail about particular polls,  the judge said.  <paragraph>   That's fine, your honor,  Duncan replied.  <paragraph>   I'm sorry,  Hickman quickly chimed in.  <paragraph>  After nine days of deliberation, the jury revealed on May 31 that it had   <hyperlink> acquitted Edwards on one felony count and was hopelessly deadlocked on five others. The Justice Department quickly announced that it would not retry the case.  <paragraph>  CORRECTION  Tuesday 11:15 P.M. : The initial version of this post said Hickman is based in North Carolina. His polling firm is based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, just outside Washington D.C.  <paragraph>  UPDATE  Nov. 2, 2:02 P.M. : Some, including the U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Deb Fischer in Nebraska, have seized on this post and Hickman’s testimony in the Edwards trial to suggest that Hickman deliberately skewed his firm’s polls for Edwards and may be doing something similar again in the current election cycle. This year, Hickman is polling for Fischer’s rival, former Sen. Bob Kerrey  D-Neb. .  <paragraph>  After Kerrey’s campaign released a poll Hickman took last month finding Kerrey within striking distance of Fischer,  <hyperlink> Roll Call reported that Fischer campaign spokesman Daniel Keylin said Hickman “admitted under oath that he cherry picked numbers to boost John Edwards’s struggling presidential campaign.” “It’s déjà vu all over again,” Keylin told the newspaper via e-mail.  <paragraph>  However, neither POLITICO’s post nor the transcript of Hickman’s court testimony linked to in the original post indicate that the pollster deliberately skewed any of the polls he did for Edwards or anyone else. At Edwards’s trial, prosecutors did not challenge the accuracy of the surveys Hickman conducted on behalf of the campaign.
Guantanamo prisoner returns to Canada |  <paragraph>  The United States sent to Canada Saturday morning a Guantanamo prisoner who was born in Canada and captured in Afghanistan at the age of 15, announced the Department of Defense.  <paragraph>  Omar Khadr, now 26, was shot in a battle with U.S. Special Forces in Afghanistan in 2002. He was charged with war crimes, including the murder of a Special Forces medic, though some experts expressed doubt about the legality of charging one combatant in a military encounter with killing another barring some sort of unusual circumstances. Khadr's age also complicated the case and drew criticism of it from international human rights groups.  <paragraph>  In 2010, Khadr pled guilty to the charges as part of a plea deal that called for him to serve eight more years in custody, but allowed for his transfer to Canada after a year and included no guarantee of how long he would actually be confined after returning to Canada.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> The Star report notes that Khadr can apply for parole next summer. However, a senior administration official told POLITICO that Khadr will serve out the sentence imposed by the U.S. military commission at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>   We do not provide details of security assurances, but we did have extensive discussions with the Canadians about the way ahead for Khadr. He will be incarcerated and serve out the remainder of his sentence,  said the U.S. official, who asked not to be named in discussing the diplomatic discussions.  <paragraph>  Khadr was picked up at Guantanamo before dawn Saturday and was being flown to Canada, the news reports said.  <paragraph>  Khadr's transfer and the recent death of another detainee leave the public count of prisoners at Guantanamo at 166.  <paragraph>  UPDATE  Saturday, 9:05 A.M. : This post has been updated with comment from the U.S. official and to note that Khadr is likely to serve at least some additional jail time in Canada.
Obama talked of Libya attack as 'terror' 2 weeks ago |  <paragraph>  Despite a drumbeat from the right and even   <hyperlink> independent fact-checkers that President Barack Obama has been unwilling to label as terrorism the attack on a United States diplomatic mission in Libya, the president indicated just a day after the killing of the American ambassador there that the assault was part of a series of  acts of terror  the U.S. has faced.  <paragraph>   No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for,  Obama said   <hyperlink> in a Rose Garden statement on Sept. 12.  Today, we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America.  We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act.  And make no mistake, justice will be done.   <paragraph>  Notwithstanding Obama's initial statement, Republicans have faulted him for failing to use the word  terrorism  to describe the attack, even when he was asked directly about it during an interview on Monday.  <paragraph>   More than two weeks after the attack on our Consulate in Benghazi, President Obama finally called this what it clearly was: an act of terrorism, not a spontaneous protest against a disgusting video,  Sens. John McCain  R-Ariz.  and Lindsay Graham  R-S.C.  said in a statement Wednesday.  We recognize that Al-Qaeda involvement in a terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Libya is an inconvenient truth for a President who claims to be destroying Al-Qaeda. But it is not too much to ask why the President and his Administration have taken so long to state what has appeared obvious for a long time about what really happened in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.   <paragraph>   Why Won't Obama Call It Terrorism?  Republican National Committee Chairman   <hyperlink> Reince Priebus asked in a RealClearPolitics op-ed Thursday.  He [Obama] yet again failed to call it what was: a terrorist attack on the 11th anniversary of 9 11....Now, nearly everyone but the president himself has finally admitted: the attack was the work of terrorists.   <paragraph>  The GOP criticism, while a bit sloppy, isn't without any merit. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice did seem to make   <hyperlink> an intentional effort 10 days or so ago to argue that the attack stemmed from a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim video. Her comments were all the more notable because up until that point, the State Department was refusing to answer questions about discrepancies between Libyan and U.S. statements on the issue.  <paragraph>  It's also fair to note that Obama's initial Rose Garden statement implied a link between the video and the attack, as did almost all of the initial news coverage of the deadly violence at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.  <paragraph>  According to   <hyperlink> House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers  R-Mich. , there's no indication a protest was under way at the consulate when the compound came under assault from rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.  <paragraph>  In addition to Ambassador Chris Stevens, three other Americans were killed in the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi.
Secrecy rule eased in 9 11 case |  <paragraph>  Military prosecutors have agreed to ease secrecy in the case against five alleged Sept. 11 conspirators by ending a presumption that every word the defendants say is classified national security information, defense lawyers said Tuesday.  <paragraph>   Presumptive classification violates American national security regulations, but it has prevailed for years at Guantanamo Bay,” said James Connell, an attorney for alleged conspirator Ammar al Baluchi. “Hopefully, this change of position will mark the beginning of the end of presumptive classification.”  <paragraph>  Defense attorneys have railed against the presumptive classification procedure, saying it unnecessarily complicated their dealings with their clients and the process for military commissions being carried out at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  Details of the decision are not publicly available, due to—wait for it—a presumption that all court filings could contain classified information and therefore are kept from the public while they await a classification review.  <paragraph>  However, in a statement, chief prosecutor Army Brig. Gen. Mark Martins seemed to confirm the gist of the defense's announcement.  <paragraph>   As a general matter across all cases, I will say that the government is committed to considering every reasonable and appropriate measure that could help facilitate the attorney-client relationship for those accused before reformed military commissions who seek such a relationship.  This includes measures that, while safeguarding national security and force protection, may also increase the convenience of handling and use by the defense of discussions clients have with their counsel involving classified or potentially classified information,  Martins said.  <paragraph>  It's not immediately clear whether the change of procedure will result in more information reaching the public in military commission legal filings or hearings. However, Connell said in an interview that the new process would make it easier for the defense to request and hold hearings on matters not directly related to the defendants' alleged offenses or role in terrorist activity. Defendants might be able to testify at some hearings without them being closed to the public.  <paragraph>   It will likely have some impact on the transparency of the process,  Connell said.  <paragraph>  Connell said it's unclear whether the decision will apply in cases beyond that arising from the Sept. 11 attacks. It does not apply at the moment to the military commission case related to the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, he said.
Does Romney have tax shelters? | <paragraph>  A tax shelter, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder.  <paragraph>  In the wake of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's disclosure Friday of his tax 2011 returns, President Barack Obama's campaign charged that the returns show Romney is dodging some of his tax obligations.  <paragraph>   His release also confirmed what we already knew, which is that he pays a lower rate than most middle-class families because of a set of complex loopholes and tax shelters, and raised more questions than provided answers,  Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Saturday.  <paragraph>  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  D-Nev.  also seemed to advance the shelter claim, saying,  Once again, we see Mitt Romney is out of touch with middle class families, who don’t have the luxury of accounting wizards and foreign tax shelters.   <paragraph>  Romney's campaign issued a statement Friday in which former IRS commissioner Fred Goldberg reissued his previous opinion that not only were Romney's returns on the up-and-up, but that there was no evidence he'd made any particular effort to lower his tax burden.  There is no indication or suggestion of any tax-motivated or aggressive tax planning activities,  Goldberg said.  <paragraph>  I asked the Obama campaign how the returns show Romney has tax shelters. A spokesman sent a few news clippings that use that term, including   <hyperlink> a news story in The Washington Post and   <hyperlink> an editorial in The New York Times.  <paragraph>  Asked if Romney considers any of the investments to be  tax shelters,  a spokesman replied:  These funds are all registered with the IRS and report all income to investors and the IRS. The Romney's are taxed on the income from these investments by the blind trust  the same way they would be if the shares were held in the US. No taxes are evaded or reduced.   <paragraph>  Part of the disagreement comes down to issues around the definition of  tax shelters.  There are plenty of ways to limit or eliminate tax on certain income. Many, like investing in state or municipal bonds, are so commonplace that it would be hard to call them shelters. Other techniques are still legal but more obscure. And still others are of dubious legality, consisting of transactions that have little or no economic benefit but huge tax benefits. <paragraph>  Most of the buzzwords that make for good TV ads, about investments in the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, relate to a fairly standard practice of placing overseas U.S.-run investment funds with multiple foreign owners so that foreign investors aren't subject to U.S. taxes. Those foreigners might well dodge taxes, legally or illegally, on that income, but a U.S. citizen is still required to report and pay taxes on worldwide income.  <paragraph>  However,  <hyperlink> The Wall Street Journal reported in January about one tactic Romney  or his blind trust trustee  uses that appears to have the benefit of preventing immediate taxation of some investment income in his unusually large individual retirement account. Some of Romney's investments in that account, which are parked offshore, would be subject to an immediate 35 percent U.S. tax on earnings if kept here.  <paragraph>  However, the Romney campaign countered to the Journal that those investments were not evading U.S. taxes, but preserving the tax-deferred nature of IRAs in which millions of Americans invest.  Governor Romney’s IRA is tax deferred, just like the IRA’s of every other American.  Its investments are in compliance with rules created to keep it tax deferred, just like it was intended to be,  a spokesman told the newspaper.
U.S. names 55 Gitmo prisoners cleared to go |  <paragraph>  The U.S. Government has for the first time issued a public list of Guantanamo prisoners cleared for release or transfer, but who remain at the island prison because of difficulties finding a country willing to take them or because of concerns about sending them to their home countries.  <paragraph>  The list  posted   <hyperlink> here  was filed in a series of federal court cases Friday morning and includes the names and serial numbers of 55 detainees. That's almost exactly one-third of the 167 men currently imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  A significant number of the men are believed to be Yemeni.  <hyperlink> President Barack Obama suspended further transfers to Yemen in January 2010, stating that conditions in the country were too  unsettled  to ensure that detainees wouldn't return to or embark on terrorist activities.  <paragraph>  Since 2009, the U.S. Government has kept under wraps the list of detainees approved for release. In a court filing back then  posted   <hyperlink> here , the State Department's envoy for Guantanamo, Ambassador Daniel Fried, cited a need to coordinate diplomatic efforts to resettle the war-on-terror prisoners.  <paragraph>  However, in the new court filings Friday, Justice Department lawyers said that need no longer merited keeping the list secret. They didn't quite concede that the resettlement process has stalled, but that was the implication. Congress has also greatly complicated releases from Guantanamo with a series of legislative measures attached to budget bills that Obama signed into law.  <paragraph>   In the over two years since the [Guantanamo Bay Review] Task Force completed its status reviews, circumstances have changed such that the decisions by the Task Force approving detainees for transfer no longer warrant protection,  the DOJ lawyers wrote in their notice to the court  posted   <hyperlink> here .  <paragraph>   The efforts of the United States to resettle Guantanamo detainees have largely been successful – they have resulted in 40 detainees being resettled in third countries because of treatment or other concerns in their countries of origin since 2009. In addition, 28 detainees have been repatriated to their countries of origin since 2009. Consequently, the diplomatic and national security harms identified [by Fried in a 2009 court filing] are no longer as acute. In Respondents’ view, there is no longer a need to withhold from the public the status of detainees who have been approved for transfer.   <paragraph>  It's unclear whether the list was ever officially classified, but it was designated as  protected  by the U.S. Government—a designation in Guantanamo cases that effectively keeps certain court records from the public.  <paragraph>  A note on the list indicates that more than 55 detainees may actually be cleared for release, but the status of any additional prisoners ordered released has been placed under seal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  <paragraph>  UPDATE: Two civil liberties groups have issued statements reacting to the list's disclosure. <paragraph>   These men have been cleared for release for at least three years  longer in many cases , and yet they have been held at Guantanamo now for eleven years and counting. It's unconscionable that so few of these cleared men have been released by this administration over the last three years,  said Shane Kadidal of the Center for Constitutional Rights.   The list is clearly incomplete, and based on the total numbers seems to not include the Yemenis cleared for conditional release. Moreover, the government notes in its brief that for a number of cleared men it still needs to seek formal court approval to release their names. That should not be a problem but will take time, and people reading the list should know that some cleared men are not listed only because of this legal technicality.   <paragraph>  “Today’s release is a partial victory for transparency, and it should also be a spur to action,” said Zachary Katznelson of the American Civil Liberties Union. “These men have now spent three years in prison since our military and intelligence agencies all agreed they should be released. Not on the list, of course, is Adnan Latif, who died in his cell earlier this month despite having been repeatedly approved for release from Guantánamo. It is well past time to release and resettle these unfairly imprisoned men.” <paragraph>  CORRECTION  Friday, 9:21 P.M. : This post has been corrected to clarify the reasons Obama gave for suspending transfers to Yemen in 2010.
Appeals court unblocks indefinite detention law |  <paragraph>  A single federal appeals court judge put a temporary hold Monday night on a district court judge's ruling blocking enforcement of indefinite detention provisions in a defense bill passed by Congress and signed into law last year by President Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit Judge Raymond Lohier issued a one-page order staying the district court judge's injunction until a three-judge appeals court panel can take up the issue on September 28.  <paragraph>  Lohier offered no explanation or rationale for the temporary stay. However, the Justice Department has asked the appeals court to block the injunction   <hyperlink> issued by U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Forrest last Wednesday.  <paragraph>  U.S. government officials have argued that the provision in the National Defense Authorization Act simply restates existing law on so-called law-of-war detention, at least the law as interpreted by the D.C. Circuit regarding who can be held for providing  substantial support  to Al Qaeda or allied groups. Critics, including journalists and other activists who filed suit over the provision, say they are in fear of being detained for engaging in their regular work.  <paragraph>  The legal dispute about whether the law can be blocked turns to a great extent on arcane legal points. The Justice Department claims that even though the provision didn't change existing law, blocking causes irreparable harm because blocking any Congressionally-passed statute does so. Forrest said the government's concession meant there was no urgency to keeping the law enforceable.  <paragraph>  Both Forrest and Lohier are Obama appointees.
Feds: Hide SEAL name given to Hollywood |  <paragraph>  Last July,  <hyperlink> a top Pentagon official gave two Hollywood filmmakers the name of a Navy SEAL involved in training the squad of commandos who carried out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Now, the Obama administration is fighting to keep that same name from the public.  <paragraph>  In legal papers filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, the Justice Department argued that the government is under no obligation to make public the SEAL's name or the names of Central Intelligence Agency personnel involved simply because officials shared their names, partial names or identities with the makers of a forthcoming movie about the raid,  Zero Dark Thirty.   <paragraph>   The CIA and DoD did not authorize the filmmakers to make the names they shared with them public, to publicly associate the individuals with the CIA or DoD, or to expose those individuals’ identity in any publicly released film, and there was no reason for the CIA or DoD to have believed that any of this would have happened,  the Justice Department brief says.  In fact, [Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Mike] Vickers specifically told [filmmaker] Mark Boal, in providing him with the name of someone he could talk to, that 'the only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any way as a consultant.'   <paragraph>   This limited disclosure of the names to the filmmakers does not make the information 'truly public' under the public domain doctrine,  DOJ lawyers argue.  The filmmakers were not authorized to release the names publicly, and the names have not, to our knowledge, been released to the public.   <paragraph>  The brief  posted   <hyperlink> here  was filed in a lawsuit the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch filed against the Defense Department and CIA seeking disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act of records about government cooperation with Hollywood's effort to bring the bin Laden raid to the big screen.  <paragraph>  The dispute over the names puts journalists in an awkward position. Press advocates generally favor broad disclosure under FOIA and a narrow reading of exemptions the government uses to hold back information requested under that law. However, journalists are often privy to the names of officials providing background briefings and sometimes are given sensitive or classified information on condition it not be disclosed. A strict rule that what's given to any outsider must be given to all could wind up restricting journalists' access to that kind of information.  <paragraph>  Generally, the government can't use exemptions from FOIA to withhold information it has officially disclosed elsewhere. However, for the government to lose its right to withhold the info, the previous disclosure has to be essentially identical  which usually makes the whole fight pointless  and part of some permanent public record.  <paragraph>  In the  Zero Dark Thirty  case, the Justice Department contends that even if the government released the name or names in question, it's irrelevant because the whole  public domain doctrine  doesn't apply in cases where personal privacy is at issue. However, the government did not cite any appellate cases in the D.C. Circuit to support that position. <paragraph>  A Pentagon spokesman told POLITICO  in May that while the filmmakers were offered the opportunity to meet with the SEAL raid planner, the meeting never took place. <paragraph>   Zero Dark Thirty  is slated for release on Dec. 19.
Activists troubled by White House call to YouTube |  <paragraph>  Prominent civil liberties groups expressed concern on Friday over news that   <hyperlink> the White House urged YouTube to review whether an anti-Muslim video posted on the video sharing site violated the firm's policies. <paragraph>   There's no indication that the government is questioning the right of these idiots to make that repellent film. On the other hand, it does make us nervous when the government throws its weight behind any requests for censorship,  the American Civil Liberties Union's Ben Wizner said in an interview Friday.  <paragraph>   I am actually kind of distressed by this,  said Eva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Even though there are all these great quotes from inside the White House saying they support free speech....by calling YouTube from the White House, they were sending a message no matter how much they say we don't want them to take it down, when the White House calls and asks you to review it, it sends a message and has a certain chilling effect.   <paragraph>  The White House confirmed the request on Friday, but insisted that YouTube was not asked to take down the video, which paints the Prophet Mohammed as sex-crazed and has led to violent protests at U.S. diplomatic posts across North Africa.  <paragraph>   The White House asked YouTube to review the video to see if it was in compliance with their terms of use,  White House press secretary Jay Carney told POLITICO in an e-mail.  <paragraph>  Both Wizner and Galperin said they'd like to know more details about precisely who contacted YouTube, why, and what was asked of the firm.  <paragraph>  A White House spokesman wouldn't offer much additional detail to POLITICO Friday, but said the request took place on Tuesday and was made by a member of the National Security Council staff.  <paragraph>  Galperin told POLITICO it was pretty clear the White House wanted the video taken down.  They were not calling in support of keeping the video up,  she said.  The fact they called at all is highly problematic...I don’t think anyone at the White House genuinely thought YouTube had not revewied this video. It is simply ludicrous to say so.   <paragraph>  Wizner said he was not troubled by figures like President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton publicly condemning the video, so long as they made clear that it was protected by the First Amendment.  <paragraph>   It's staggeringly offensive,  Wizner said of the video.  There's nothing inappropriate about government officials expressing strongly held views about speech so long as they understand where the line is,  he added, noting that the Supreme Court ruled last year, 8-1, in favor of the right of anti-gay religious protesters to demonstrate at military funerals.  It's hard to imagine speech more repellent, more offensive and more painful than that....It's not sandbox out there.   <paragraph>  Obama did not mention free speech rights in his first remarks Wednesday on the controversy and the possibly related attack that killed four U.S. State Department staffers at a diplomatic post in Libya, including the U.S. ambassador to that country. However, during a press interview a short time later, the president did vow to protect First Amendment rights.  <paragraph>   We believe in the First Amendment.  It is one of the hallmarks of our Constitution that I’m sworn to uphold.  And so we are always going to uphold the rights for individuals to speak their mind.  On the other hand, this film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that,  Obama told CBS's  60 Minutes  later Wednesday.  <paragraph>  YouTube has blocked access to the video on its site by users in Egypt, Libya and India. Afghanistan's government has reportedly blocked all access to YouTube in order to prevent access to the offending video.  <paragraph>  Spokespeople for YouTube, which is owned by Google, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the White House's contact with the company. However,  <hyperlink> in a statement Wednesday—a day after the White House request, the firm said the video was  clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube.   <paragraph>  On Wednesday, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Martin Dempsey,  <hyperlink> called a controversial Christian pastor in Florida to ask him not to screen or promote the film. Dempsey, who was seeking to prevent violence against U.S. military personnel abroad, acted  on his own initiative,   <hyperlink> a Pentagon spokesman said.
Iranian-American group, leader lose libel case against writer | <paragraph>  A federal judge has thrown out a libel suit charging an author with falsely branding a prominent Iranian-American group and its president with being agents of the regime in Tehran.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Judge John Bates issued   <hyperlink> a decision Thursday rejecting the lawsuit brought by the National Iranian-American Council and its president, Trita Parsi, against writer Seid Hassan Daioleslam.  <paragraph>  Bates said NIAC and Parsi had failed to show evidence of actual malice, either that Daioeslam acted with knowledge the allegations he made were false or with reckless disregard about their accuracy.  <paragraph>  NIAC and Parsi have lobbied against efforts to increase U.S. sanctions on Iran and have sometimes pursued other goals that the Iranian government favors, such as protection of Iranian cultural artifacts that are the subject of legal disputes in the U.S. However, NIAC and Parsi have always insisted that they are representing the interests of Iranian-Americans and not that of the government in Tehran. <paragraph>  Bates made clear in his ruling that he wasn't taking a stand on whether the claims the author made about NIAC and Parsi were true.  <paragraph>   Nothing in this opinion should be construed as a finding that defendant’s articles were true. Defendant did not move for summary judgment on that ground, and it has not been addressed here,  Bates wrote. <paragraph>  A spokesman for NIACsaid the group was reviewing the ruling and would not have a comment until Friday.
Radical History from Bristol to Chicago | <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO, July 3—The sounds of exploding firecrackers, loud music and kids shouting at a block party on the street outside punctuated the narrative spun by Roger and Samuel inside Casa Aztlan, a long-time bastion of organizing in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood. The people outside were celebrating American Independence Day, while the visiting Brits were telling stories about American history that happened here in Chicago and shaped U.S. society as we know it today, yet are largely unknown by most Americans. <PARAGRAPH> Samuel and Roger  who don’t use their last names publicly  are members of the Bristol Radical History Group, which aims to reveal hidden histories and critique, debunk or expand upon accepted ones, from the mainstream versions we learn in school to the work of other radical historians and trade union scribes. They also focus on making these histories relevant to events and struggles of today. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> On Tuesday, before a small crowd in nearly 100-degree heat, they spoke about Industrial Workers of the World co-founder Lucy Parsons—specifically, her often-overlooked role in the labor movement and her ground-breaking radicalism and feminism. As Roger and Samuel described her, Parsons was a fiercely class conscious and independent spirit, denied her due by Communist, Anarchist, Socialist, feminist and mainstream establishments that didn’t quite know what to make of her. <PARAGRAPH> Roger described visiting Forest Home  Waldheim Cemetery in the Chicago suburbs—which is “like Disneyland” to labor history buffs thanks to all the luminary organizers buried there—and being saddened to see that Lucy Parsons had only a small flat headstone, compared to the impressive monuments and markers afforded other residents like Emma Goldman. <PARAGRAPH> Samuel juxtaposed Parsons with Goldman and described the animosity between the two women. While Goldman found her audience largely among the middle- or upper-class intelligentsia in New York, he said, Parsons was “in militant working class Chicago.” While Goldman is widely known for her views on free love, Samuel noted that Parsons also advocated freedom of sexuality, but saw it as tangential to the struggle for workers' rights and economic equality. He thinks this is one of the reasons that more than a century later, Parsons is not as famous as Goldman. At the time, the two women frequently traded barbs, and Samuel said their research shows that Parsons' substantive critiques of Goldman were met with “catty, snotty” insults; Goldman referred to Parsons dismissively as merely the widow of “our martyr Albert Parsons”—hanged after the infamous Haymarket Affair—and accused her of riding her husband’s coattails  or “cape” . <PARAGRAPH> In a 1976 book published by Chicago’s Charles H. Kerr Publishing Co., Carolyn Ashbaugh described the rivalry: <PARAGRAPH> Lucy Parsons' feminism, which analyzed women's oppression as a function of capitalism, was founded on working class values. Emma Goldman’s feminism took on an abstract character of freedom for women in all things, in all times, and in all places; her feminism became separate from its working class origins. Goldman represented the feminism being advocated in the anarchist movement of the 1890s [and after]. The intellectual anarchists questioned Lucy Parsons about her attitudes on the women's question. <PARAGRAPH> Lucy Parsons continued to tour the U.S. speaking and organizing for decades after the execution of her husband and comrades, even as her eyesight and health were failing. She died in a house fire on the city’s north side in 1942, and police raided the home “while it was still smoking,” in Samuel’s words, seizing about 3,000 documents that he said are still in FBI custody, despite the efforts to obtain them.  Why do they continue to hold the papers of someone who died [seven decades ago]?  Roger asked.  What are they afraid of?  <PARAGRAPH> Samuel told me that British and American unions today should look to the labor movement of Parsons' era as a model for more bold and militant tactics and more community involvement. He and Roger said the labor movement today is too disconnected from the community, lacking the deep local support that gave power to the railroad workers and also the coal miners who were on strike for a year in the United Kingdom in 1984. Samuel is a member of Britain’s national public health workers union, which, like U.S. public sector and health care unions, is under attack today. He said union health workers are seeing their jobs and pensions disappear as Britain shifts to a health care system more like that in the U.S. <PARAGRAPH> Along with raising Parson’s profile, Samuel and Roger said their presentation was also meant to remind people of the militancy of U.S. labor movements of the past. They spoke about the great Railroad Strike of 1877, which set the stage for the 1886 battle for the 8-hour-day and saw railroad workers and their families and neighbors blocking tracks across the industrial heartland and east coast. Roger noted that the workers, most of whom were not unionized, burned train stations, destroyed locomotives and fought back with arms against brutal crackdowns by militias, the National Guard and even federal troops in all-out violent confrontations. He said: <PARAGRAPH> The state response to the strike was absolutely vile…there was not much negotiation going on…they absolutely crushed the strike…But these workers were not victims, they took on the state with arms…it was a massive outbreak of class war. <PARAGRAPH> After the Lucy Parsons presentation, history group member Owen described the intriguing and mysterious life and work of journalist and itinerant laborer B. Traven, who won Oscars for the film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and much acclaim for books about workers, bandits and power struggles between the haves and have-nots, including The Cotton Pickers and The Ghost Ship. He noted that even as a well-known writer, Traven worked odd jobs, including driving cattle and manning an oil rig, and he always insisted that the typesetter who printed his work was just as important to the outcome as Traven was himself. <PARAGRAPH> In a culture obsessed with the latest exploits of the Kardashians or the cast of Jersey Shore, the lives of Parsons and Traven, as described by the history group members, are more fascinating, inspiring and provocative than any modern-day celebrity—not to mention their political and historical importance. While they will never be hot topics on TMZ or Twitter, through grassroots efforts like the Bristol Radical History Group and Charles H. Kerr  which also published Parsons' writings and speeches , hopefully more people will delve into these stories that are still highly relevant and vibrant today.
Our Kind of  Torturing  Town Journalist John Conroy’s first play chronicles a police brutality scandal in Chicago. | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Dan Breen seems to undergo a diabolical transformation as he speaks from the podium. The wise-cracking garrulous police officer who collects old coats for the homeless takes on a chilling fascistic visage as his speech crescendos: “God bless Jack, God bless you and God bless the city of Chicago!” <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile Otha Jeffries undergoes a transformation of his own before our eyes, from a sensitive if rebellious boy to a man pulsing with violence and rage, handcuffed but ready to burst “like a bomb” in his mother’s words, kicking over chairs and foaming at the mouth with impotent anger. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries and Breen are characters in My Kind of Town, a riveting play by veteran Chicago journalist John Conroy depicting the police torture scandal that he spent two decades chronicling. It plays through July 29 at the TimeLine Theatre in Chicago. <PARAGRAPH> Conroy’s stories for The Chicago Reader, including 1990’s “House of Screams,” told horrifying tales of African American men subjected to suffocation, electric shock and other certifiable torture meant to induce confessions under the watch of Vietnam veteran Jon Burge. Conroy’s dogged reporting helped bring to light the systematic and racist injustice that people at all levels of power, including then-state’s attorney and former Mayor Richard M. Daley, seemed determined to ignore. <PARAGRAPH> But as the scandal might otherwise be fading from public consciousness a year after Burge was sentenced to federal prison  on counts of obstruction of justice and perjury , the play confronts viewers in a way more visceral and raw than is possible in newsprint. It lays bare the multiple layers of pain, suffering, terror and despair meted out to men and their families by the coldly calculated methods of obtaining near-100 percent “clearance rates” in homicides at the Area Two police district. <PARAGRAPH> Breen  not a real name  is a Chicago cop under the Burge-like figure Jack Gunther, who never actually appears on stage. As played by David Parkes, Breen is a rich character with a trademark Chicago accent who exemplifies the line toed by Burge and his supporters: that police in the city’s toughest districts were dedicated servants doing what it took to protect African-American communities from bloodthirsty gangsters and thugs. Breen’s aforementioned speech is at a fundraiser for Gunther, who, like Burge did in real life, flees to Florida after the department has finally fired him. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries is a composite of a number of real men who were allegedly tortured by Burge or his underlings, some of them later released from prison after their convictions were deemed wrongful. <PARAGRAPH> Conroy came to write the play “almost by accident,” after a local producer suggested the scandal would be perfect for the stage. “I didn’t want anybody else to do it so I said yes,” he says. Though he had decades of reporting under his belt, including books about 1980s Belfast and about the police torture, Conroy had never written a play. <PARAGRAPH> “I didn’t know what I was doing, that’s why it has nine characters,” he says, noting the original draft had 13. “But I didn’t want to write a two- or three-character play. I really wanted to indict the city, and I couldn’t do that with two or three characters.” <PARAGRAPH> The play does indeed indict Chicago—the culture of political corruption, racism, segregation and cronyism which allowed the House of Screams to flourish—while at the same time it manages to celebrate the city with spot-on references to north side-south side rivalries and video clips of historic events like the 1967 Big Snow that briefly bridged racial divides. <PARAGRAPH> The sin of looking the other way is embodied in the fictionalized composite state’s attorney Maureen Buckley, who is demoted to the city hall basement after asking too many questions but nevertheless stands up for her “tribe” when it comes to the witness box. Conroy plumbs the complicated social dynamics that can arise when families are torn apart by violence, poverty and incarceration. He paints Jeffries’ parents as disturbingly but understandably ambivalent about their son’s release from prison, given his mental breakdown—“something snapped,” his mother says—and the danger he likely poses and faces if he is released. <PARAGRAPH> “I speculated that was something I might feel if my son had gone crazy, he might be homicidal or suicidal,” Conroy says. “It was actually something that came from Northern Ireland, where I met mothers who said, ‘I’m glad my son is inside because at least he won’t get killed there.’” <PARAGRAPH> Conroy says writing a play was much different from journalism, and he had to struggle to “divorce himself” from strictly portraying the facts. “I had it in my mind the script should be faithful to certain things and one of those was the years,” he notes, but director Nick Bowling eventually convinced him of the importance of condensing a complicated chronology down to two discrete time periods. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffries  played with stunning intensity by Charles Gardner  throws viewers for a loop at the end of the play—SPOILER ALERT!—with a cryptic comment indicating he may be guilty after all. Conroy says this twist was Bowling’s idea to add more drama, and he initially balked. “I felt like he’d kicked me in the gut, and Nick said that’s exactly the response we want from the audience. It boils down to the question of is it right to torture anybody regardless of what they’ve done?” <PARAGRAPH> With Burge in prison, most of the officers and prosecutors linked to the scandal  including Daley  retired or deceased and a number of tortured men released from prison, the torture scandal could be fading into the past. But Conroy is adamant that should not happen, and he hopes his play will help keep alive this history and an ongoing struggle for justice. <PARAGRAPH> “There are still a dozen guys in prison on the basis of suspect confessions,” he says. “All they’re asking for is a new hearing, but they’re having to fight this battle on their own. Everyone now knows this torture took place at Area Two, so what does it cost society to examine this small group of cases? Not much! It needs to be done. It’s immoral not to give them a new hearing.” <PARAGRAPH> He adds that people tortured at Area Two who have finished their sentences still cannot seek compensation, since the statute of limitations on filing a civil suit expired long before the evidence of systematic torture came to light. And Conroy notes that the code of silence is still alive and well in the department, as evidenced by the city’s refusal in recent years to release the names of officers with multiple misconduct complaints. A majority of city councilors have demanded such records to help root out “bad apples” and relieve taxpayers who are subsidizing millions of dollars in legal settlements against these officers, but the city has resisted. <PARAGRAPH> “Burge did not act alone,” Conroy said. “It’s good there’s been some public recognition in terms of one guy going to prison. But what about the other 30? The system has not changed.” <PARAGRAPH> Conroy never meant to become so focused on a single, ongoing investigation, he says, and he sometimes regrets that he became so publicly associated with that story to the exclusion of his other journalistic interests. But knowing that people’s lives were literally on the line, he couldn’t back off. After the tumultuous changes in the journalism industry Conroy is no longer working as a staff journalist, and it is unlikely today that any Chicago reporter would be paid to cover an investigative story to the dogged extent Conroy did. It makes you wonder what injustices may be occurring now without journalistic scrutiny. For his part, Conroy is focusing  less on the foreclosed possibilities of journalism, and more on liberating potential of theater. <PARAGRAPH> “You can do something in theater that you can’t really do in journalism, which is point the finger at the broader society,” he said. “How everybody looked the other way and no one cared.”
Shafted: Reflecting on Miners, Media and Margaret Thatcher | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Many coal-fired power plants in the United States are closing because of cheap natural gas prices, and while the closings are cheered for environmental and health reasons,  some unions lament the loss of jobs. Many who are happy to see coal plants close are also frustrated that the change is driven by a rush for gas that could curb investment in clean wind power and the  green jobs  mass wind farm construction could create. Others mourn waning interest in the development of  clean coal  technology that arguably could let the United States tap its vast domestic coal reserves more responsibly. <PARAGRAPH> Three decades ago, Great Britain had its own  Dash for Gas,  during which coal power plants and coal mines were closed as the country turned to natural gas to generate electricity. But the primary motive then was neither cheap and abundant natural gas nor environmental concern. Rather, it was then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's determined campaign to smash the powerful National Union of Mineworkers  NUM  and the labor movement in general, and to privatize public industries. <PARAGRAPH> Given current conversations about our energy futures in the United States and worldwide —not to mention scandals in British media and U.S. battles over public union rights—I think it is worth revisiting the 2009 book, Shafted: The Media, The Miners Strike and the Aftermath. <PARAGRAPH> Edited by Granville Williams, this compilation explores the role of spin, solidarity and strategy in the bitter 1984-1985 strike by miners and sympathetic union members as the Thatcher government and police acting on its behalf moved to gut the miners union and close many coal mines. Chapters written by prominent journalists and others detail the seedy ethics of many mainstream media outlets; the role of alternative media; early examples of community and  citizen journalism;  and the power of propaganda and popular organizing wielded by various parties to the conflict. <PARAGRAPH> There are juicy and shameful examples of media outlets' questionable ethics and bald partisanship, juxtaposed with the solidarity stands of union journalists and printers who refused to publish slanderous propaganda or who invoked equal-time policies to demand the miners be given a chance to tell their side. <PARAGRAPH> The book notes The Sun's plans to publish a photo of union leader Arthur Scargill cropped to make it appear he was doing a Nazi salute, The Daily Mirror's claims that union leaders paid their mortgages with Libyan cash when they didn't even have mortgages, and the BBC's manipulation of camera footage to make it appear miners rather than police were the first to become violent in the seminal clash at Orgreaves. <PARAGRAPH> Regarding the Libyan story, which was supplied by a union staffer who approached the tabloid, author Robin Ramsay notes wryly,  Ah, the logic of the tabloid journalist: he didn't ask for money, so he must be telling the truth.  <PARAGRAPH> Shafted, published with a grant from the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom, criticizes journalistic laziness and the lack of context that plagued even the less-abhorrent coverage. For example, the Tory government's statements about the  uneconomic  nature of certain union mines and the wisdom of burning up limited North Sea gas reserves in lieu of coal went unquestioned, according to Shafted, and the conflict was too often portrayed as a battle between colorful adversaries  namely Thatcher and Scargill  than a showdown that would determine the well-being of working people for many years to come. <PARAGRAPH> As a counter to most of the mainstream media's performance, Shafted celebrates the role of the grassroots alternative media, the NUM's own journal, and documentaries and articles by miners and community members, produced with the help of grassroots media organizations and the public Channel 4. <PARAGRAPH> The book notes that journalists at alternative outlets with names like Leeds Other Paper, Islington Gutter Press and Sheep Worrying could personally relate to the DIY mentality and sense of mission and passion of the union miners and their supporters. Along with print media, the book also examines music, poetry and major movies like Billy Elliott and The Full Monty. It catalogues the use of music to raise funds and awareness, from local punk shows to benefits by the likes of Chumbawumba and Billy Bragg. <PARAGRAPH> One chapter about movies and plays in decades after the strike describes how popular pieces like Billy Elliott furthered the Thatcherite idea of individualism triumphing over collectivism, and the glossing over of the impacts on depressed  pit villages  where to paraphrase sources, now heroin instead of coal runs in the veins of youth. <PARAGRAPH> Perhaps the most insightful chapter is a soul-searching essay by former BBC journalist Nicholas Jones, who looks back with dismay at how he and other journalists unquestioningly bought into the Thatcher narrative of militant trade unions as the  enemy within.  He takes a more nuanced view than other contributors of mainstream media's performance, and notes that union leader Scargill's portrayal of the media as the enemy was counter-productive since it meant journalists were often received with scorn or violence in pit villages, and thus understandably less likely to tell the people's stories.  Other chapters also describe how police brutally attacked and arrested journalists trying to report objectively on the conflict.  <PARAGRAPH> Jones also describes how the birth of the 24-hour highly competitive news cycle contributed to flawed coverage of the strike, and dissects why media coverage of mass protests against more pit closures in the early 1990s was by contrast highly sympathetic to the miners. Jones writes: <PARAGRAPH> With the benefit of hindsight, and subsequent evidence of a vindictive pit closure programme which continued during the decade which followed the strike, perhaps the news media should own up to a collective failure of judgment comparative to that during the buildup to the Iraq war.
Irish Farmers Say Shell Oil Operations Bring Injustice, Not Jobs | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> POLLATHOMAS, IRELAND—This remote peninsula on Ireland's west coast is known as a bastion of beauty and serenity, at least for those who don't mind persistent rain and chilly winds driving waves against the stunning rocky cliffs and unspoiled sand dunes. But for years the peninsula that is home to the tiny town of Pollathomas has also been the site of a battle over the ownership of natural resources and the old jobs-versus-environment debate, as the company Shell and corporate partners are seeking to exploit the lucrative Corrib gas field under the ocean 60 kilometers off shore. <PARAGRAPH> Two decades after interest in the gas field was piqued, locals and resident solidarity activists continue to fight against Shell's plans to build a gas terminal on the coast of the peninsula. Signs along the one narrow quiet country road tracing the promontory's circumference read,  No Consent,   Shell Out  and  No Haulage.  The beauty of the beaches spilling into mud flats below dramatic hills has been marred by Shell's industrial operations. Gardai  police  in fluorescent green vests ply the road in vehicles and stand around on foot—more police on a several-mile stretch of road than I saw in several weeks in the rest of the country. Private security contractors also work the area. <PARAGRAPH> Along the road, a hand-painted sign and tangled barbed wire mark the entrance to the Rossport Solidarity Camp—an outpost of ardent opponents of gas exploitation. Many Irish towns have welcome signs noting that the town is  twinned  with sister cities elsewhere in Europe. The camp sign says it is  twinned with Niger Delta and Gulf of Mexico.  Bikes rest throughout the camp, and tents made of heavy military canvas are fortified against the constant rain. <PARAGRAPH> Up the road from the camp a local activist traipsing the road in barefeet despite the chill pauses to move a dead rat gently into the bushes and later checks on a sheep entangled in a fence. He explains the splits in the movement against Shell, wherein some opponents are open to negotiations if Ireland gets a better deal or the terminal is moved farther offshore, while others are flat-out opposed to gas extraction. <PARAGRAPH> Shell and government supporters argue that the terminal would provide an economic boost sorely needed in these tough times, creating 800 construction jobs and 130 permanent jobs. <PARAGRAPH> On its website, Shell says the company has met with protesters and fishermen concerned about water contamination, and altered its pipeline route and committed to stringent water treatment as a result. The company's website boasts of quality working conditions, including 2 million work hours and 365 days injury-free in the past year. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile several prominent studies show that Ireland would be getting a much smaller slice of the actual gas profits than almost any other country typically gets from natural resource deals. <PARAGRAPH> Supoport is still strong for the  Rossport Five,  locals who in 2007 were jailed for three months on contempt charges for disobeying an injunction regarding protesting against Shell. The activist I spoke with noted that local farmers and teachers feel they are just protecting their historical land,  and you know land is a big deal in Ireland.  <PARAGRAPH> In a Q & A for the Goldman Environmental Prize, awarded to Rossport organizer Willie Corduff, the group Kilcommom Community said that Shell's operations have made residents feel  under seige : <PARAGRAPH> Many residents' first experience of the consortium is one of threats, bullying and intimidation. Many felt pressured to sign commitments to allow their land to be used. <PARAGRAPH> Shell and government proponents have billed the gas as an important domestic source that would meet a large portion of Ireland's energy needs, though several regular residents I talked with noted that the gas will be sold on the open market—by a foreign company—offering no real energy security for Ireland. <PARAGRAPH> Given Ireland's tumultuous and painful political history and recent economic turmoil, it's clear that the controversy over the gas terminal taps into deep-seated feelings about sovereignty, land ownership, survival and freedom. I can only imagine the controversy is also exacerbated by increasing interest in fracking for natural gas in western Ireland; and complicated by the struggle to reduce carbon emissions where natural gas plays an important role as a relatively clean-burning fuel. <PARAGRAPH> As the turf-cutting controversy I wrote about previously shows, it seems clear that big-picture environmental promises and even the prospects for some jobs pale beside the importance of protecting land and traditional ways of life in these parts.
Chicago Teachers Union Takes the Upper Hand with Overwhelming Strike Vote | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The Chicago Teachers Union lost an important skirmish with Mayor Rahm Emanuel last year when the state legislature passed Emanuel-backed legislation requiring a 75 percent vote to authorize a strike – a high number seen as a blow for teachers unions in Illinois. <PARAGRAPH> But the attack apparently helped energize and mobilize the Chicago Teachers Union  CTU , as a whopping 89 percent of teachers voted on June 11 to authorize a strike come fall  actually late summer  as highly contentious contract negotiations stretch on. Chicago teachers last went on strike in 1987. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel acknowledged the overwhelming vote but tried to minimize its significance by asking the public and media to focus on other numbers – the increased hours he wants kids in school. Teachers have repeatedly said they are not against a longer school day or school year, but demand appropriate pay raises in return. Emanuel rescinded a contractually obligated 4 percent raise for teachers during his first year in office, and now his administration is proposing a contract with a 2 percent raise while lengthening the work day from seven hours to seven hours and 40 minutes. <PARAGRAPH> Many parents have pushed for a compromise, with more time in school but not as much as Emanuel and Chicago Public Schools CEO Jean-Claude Brizard are demanding. Critics of the longer day cite oppressive heat in many non-air conditioned buildings, other demands on students’ time and the inescapable fact that Chicago schools’ problems go much deeper than the number of hours in class. <PARAGRAPH> At five hours and 45 minutes, Chicago students have one of the nation’s shortest days. But teachers say the actual amount of instruction in Chicago schools is on par with other schools nationwide. There is no easy fix for the systematic economic and social problems that impact Chicago students, but more resources and smaller class sizes would likely do more than extended days to improve student engagement and performance. <PARAGRAPH> The union says the administration’s contract proposal will result in larger class sizes. Jackson Potter blogged on the union website: <PARAGRAPH> Like Republican candidate Mitt Romney, they make the argument that class size doesn’t matter…The Board has reserved the right to change class size policy at any time and merely notify the union and it has eliminated any funding of positions to lower class size in the district; the previous contract committed $2.25 million to lower class sizes. These changes will concretely increase our class sizes throughout the district, even though many kindergarten and primary grade classrooms throughout the city have class sizes that approach 50 students in a room. <PARAGRAPH> The union blasts the administration’s proposal for increasing the focus on standardized test-based student performance in evaluating teachers, including an emphasis on “merit pay.” Nationwide, teachers have long complained that evaluating their performance based heavily on standardized testing is unfair to dedicated teachers in under-funded, low-income and immigrant-heavy schools and curbs their ability to teach creatively. <PARAGRAPH> Potter summarizes other reasons the union opposes the administration’s proposal: eliminating teachers’ ability to bank sick days, increasing health insurance costs and requiring teachers to work 10-hour-days during report card pickup. <PARAGRAPH> In the wake of the strike vote Emanuel also touted the fact that 60.6 percent of Chicago Public Schools students who were freshmen four years ago graduated this year – the highest rate since at least 1999. But the insinuation that this improvement is because of measures pushed by his administration comes off as disingenuous when one considers that these measures have only been rolled out in recent months and not in all schools. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel said the strike vote does not affect ongoing contract negotiations with the teachers union, but the union has noted that taking the vote several months before they might strike was meant to provide leverage in the negotiations and allow 1,500 retiring teachers to vote. With more than 25,000 unionized teachers, CPS is the third-largest school district in the country and the CTU is the largest member of the American Federation of Teachers. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel has portrayed teachers as putting their interests before students’ well-being, and professed his dedication to Chicago students – framing his battle with the teachers as a fight for opportunity and equality for low-income students. But many parents and students have spoken out in support of teachers, who often already put in many unpaid hours and often spent money out of their own pockets to buy supplies. <PARAGRAPH> There has been much intrigue around efforts to generate community support  or the appearance of it  for the Emanuel administration’s reform policies, including revelations last year that politically connected ministers had paid church members to show up at community meetings in support of administration proposals to close so-called failing schools. Around the strike vote, many parents received robocalls attacking the teachers' decision to hold an early strike vote. The calls and other efforts against the teachers have been linked to national astroturf  education reform  groups also active in California and other states where public sector unions have squared off with city and state officials. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, it turns out that Obama strategist David Axelrod’s former public relations firm AKPD Media and Messaging is behind ads attacking the teachers union. Long-time progressive school reformer and small schools advocate Mike Klonsky noted in a blog post about this revelation that Emanuel “seems hell-bent on destroying the city's public employee unions.” Klonsky also questioned the motivations of American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten sharing the podium with Emanuel in support of his massive new infrastructure plan – with a heavy focus on privatization – just weeks after she marched with Chicago teachers calling for a strike vote.  The infrastructure plan’s marketing is spearheaded by another of Axelrod’s former outfits, ASGK Public Strategies.  <PARAGRAPH> Chicago Sun-Times columnist – and former teacher – Carol Marin noted: <PARAGRAPH> Teachers in this town have been demonized, demoralized, and disrespected. No profession is beyond criticism and no public school system is without significant problems. But taking a sledgehammer approach to CPS teachers and their union has backfired on the Emanuel administration and his schools CEO, Jean-Claude Brizard. And all the radio ads and robo calls funded by out of town, union-busting billionaires doesn’t alter that fact. <PARAGRAPH> While longer days and closing schools are the prominent issues in Emanuel’s battle with union teachers, the conflict has much deeper significance in terms of ongoing battles for the future of public employees unions. And while Emanuel and others who figure into the administration’s plans are considered far to the left of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the battle promises to continue nearly as polarized and hard-fought. Stay tuned.
Youth Sex Workers Organize for Their Rights | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> When youth who live on the streets and work in the sex trade or other informal economies are victimized or abused, often the institutions that are supposed to help them—the police, hospitals and clinics, social service and non-profit agencies, homeless shelters—do more harm than good. <PARAGRAPH> A recent report by the Young Women's Empowerment Project in Chicago quantifies and analyzes this problem and describes and promotes a two-pronged solution wherein youth develop their own systems and networks for self-help and healing while also working with institutions to provide better services. <PARAGRAPH> YWEP youth leaders, who have a policy of not revealing their identities, worked together to answer my questions about this initiative. They said,  Institutions have so many rules and guidelines that prevent young people from even feeling comfortable in institutional atmospheres, it doesn't give them the room to grow. We don't dictate a young person's future and make decisions for them, we support them to make it on their own because we believe they know what they need to do to survive.  <PARAGRAPH> The report notes that much of the bad treatment young people receive is related to the fact or supposition that they survive through sex work or other informal work on the street, combined with general prejudice toward LGBTQ and gender non-conforming youth. While many organizations dealing with sex workers aim to help them leave sex work, YWEP maintains that it is a valid individual choice and practices a harm reduction philosophy to help young people stay physically and emotionally safe and healthy no matter how they make a living. <PARAGRAPH> The youth leaders told me,  Through the work and programs at YWEP, we have all had individual experiences of developing new skills, making important relevant and positive changes in our lives and feeling like we have a place to call our own in a world that is adultist, racist, sexist and homophobic and threatens our daily existence.  <PARAGRAPH> YWEP has launched a  Bad Encounter Line  or BEL project where youth can use forms, a phone line, blank zines or meetings with advocates to report specific bad experiences with institutions including police, health care and non-profit agencies. The report, which analyzes 146 of these reports since September 2009, shows that police received the most complaints, followed by health care agencies. The report is also based on incidents reported to advocates and staff wherein youth did not use the BEL structure. Almost all the reports came from youth of color, and transgender youth were disproportionately likely to have bad experiences. <PARAGRAPH> Horror stories included being arrested and-or sexually assaulted and harrassed by police when reporting a rape or other crime, or simply when standing on the street. Youth also reported a prevalent problem with being placed in psychiatric care against their will when reporting a crime or seeking health care. In some cases health professionals decided youth needed psychiatric care just because they are transgender, or because they had  too many sexual partners.  One transgender youth reported being openly mocked by a nurse and patients at an emergency room, then denied entry to the emergency room  told it was  full  , because their name didn't match their appearance. Such experiences mean youth often don't seek medical attention at all when they need it. The YWEP leaders told me,  The constant oppressions create a lack of trust between the young people and the adults in the helping institutions ... A lot of adults that work in these agencies do not see the power or relevance of the youth voice. Because they are set up to help, a lot of people assume these agencies are doing good, even though they might actually be harming young people.  <PARAGRAPH> The complaints about police included being told they could avoid arrest in exchange for sex, then often being arrested even if they did give in to the officers' demands. One girl reported being arrested after she ignored an officer saying  Come over here, girl with all that ass —and told him that is not her name. Many complaints were also lodged about the Department of Children and Family Services, including that children were taken away immediately after birth if young mothers declined to give a father's name. <PARAGRAPH> The report notes that surprisingly few BEL complaints have been filed regarding non-profit agencies, given that they hear complaints about such agencies frequently; the report surmises that maybe youth feel less comfortable making a written complaint about such organizations. <PARAGRAPH> The highest number of BEL complaints came from Englewood, a very low-income African American neighborhood on the city's south side; and Lakeview, a relatively affluent neighborhood that is home base to many youth who live and work on the streets. <PARAGRAPH> The study describes the movement Street Youth Rising Up!, which focuses on empowering youth to stand up for their rights and to work together to provide for themselves some of the resources and care that they are not getting from institutions. The group has worked with the Chicago Women's Health Center to train youth in basic reproductive health care and self-exams, and also helps youth file grievances and demand their legal rights from government and other institutions. They note that these rights include the right to decide to live without a  traditional  home  defined as  home free   and to have as many sex partners as one chooses, as well as the right to make a living in informal economies  including the sex trade. <PARAGRAPH> YWEP has published a Street Youth Bill of Rights outlining such rights and how institutions can respect them, and they are asking institutional representatives to sign on and help them promote the movement. The BEL program also continues, creating a formal outlet to press for change from specific institutions and more generally, and also allowing youth to share practical advice  published in a zine  helping them to pragmatically navigate institutions. The YWEP leaders told me that a West side shelter is using the bill of rights to revise their housing contract and make it more youth-friendly, and organizations including the Broadway Youth Center, Sage Community Health Collective, Project Nia and the Chicago Women's Health Center have formally endorsed the bill of rights. <PARAGRAPH> They said,  We are organizing and building power. After we get 10 more organizations to endorse we will use our collective power to try to influence policy at an institutional or governmental level... We believe institutions will change when they are approached by young people who have first-hand experience in the street economy and by hearing our personal testimony of what the hell we have been through. 
Unhappy Father’s Day! Paid Paternity Leave Far From Reality in United States | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Many of the young fathers who celebrated Father's Day on Sunday are more interested than ever in taking an active care-giving and social role in their children's lives, according to studies cited in a new report by the National Partnership for Women and Families. But especially in the tight economy, relatively few fathers have access to paid family leave after the birth of a child or when a child is sick, and too few fathers even have unpaid job-protected leave to deal with family emergencies and responsibilities.  <PARAGRAPH>  The Partnership's report,  Dads Expect Better: Top States for New Dads,  evaluates state laws beyond the federal requirements of the Family Medical Leave Act  FMLA  implemented in 1993, which guarantees a certain amount of unpaid leave for employees with more than 1,250 hours of service at workplaces with at least 50 employees. In May, the Partnership released  Expecting Better: A State-by-State Analysis of Laws that Help New Parents.   <PARAGRAPH>  The report on fathers paints a dire picture of the paltry paid and unpaid leave afforded parents. It also makes the case that more family leave for fathers helps women and children and even society as a whole, citing studies that show when fathers  and mothers  get better leave, families are less likely to need public assistance.   <PARAGRAPH>  It notes that fathers are better able to share household and caregiving duties with women when they have more leave and job protection, which can lessen the work and earning inequities between men and women and help children have closer relationships with their fathers and better role models for gender equity. The report cites longitudinal evidence that fathers who could take paid leave immediately after a child's birth remained more involved in their lives down the line.   <PARAGRAPH>  Family leave is of course also especially important to single working fathers, who like single mothers can often be in the painful and terrifying position of losing a badly needed job or wages when a child is sick. The report found fathers report more conflict between their work and family life than before, in fact at higher rates than women report conflict, perhaps because of men's increasing desire to be involved with their children.  <PARAGRAPH>  The report notes that only the District of Columbia and Connecticut guarantee workers the right to earn paid sick days. It says the United States ranks among the middle of 21 highly competitive countries in the amount of leave granted to new fathers, with 12 unpaid weeks mandated under the FMLA.  <PARAGRAPH>  However, on average, men take only 10.4 weeks of unpaid leave, and many cannot afford unpaid leave at all. Even the best employers typically don't offer more than three weeks of paid paternity leave, with the amount declining since 2005. That compares to 31 countries that guarantee or offer 14 weeks or more of paid paternity leave.  <PARAGRAPH>  After California implemented the nation's first paternity leave insurance program in 2005, the amount of leave fathers took almost tripled from three to eight weeks, and the likelihood they would take leave at all more than doubled to three-quarters. Ratings for the social acceptability of taking paternity leave also climbed. Along with California, New Jersey also has a family leave insurance program covering mothers and fathers. Studies show a significant majority of Americans support expanded paternity and maternity and family leave rights.  <PARAGRAPH>  The report ranks the District of Columbia and the 14 states that do offer guaranteed family-leave rights for fathers on factors including the amount of paid and unpaid job-protected leave, whether leave laws cover small businesses or newer employees not covered under the FMLA  and whether fathers can take leave to care for a same-sex or domestic partner's child. The District of Columbia ranked first, followed by Connecticut and New Jersey in second place, then California. Maine, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Tennessee, Maryland and Minnesota also joined the list.  <PARAGRAPH>   Despite the imperative -- for workers and families, for businesses and for communities -- to adapt our nation's policies to the realities of the  21st century workforce, progress is painfully slow,  the report notes.  The arrival of a child should be cause for celebration. For millions of parents throughout the United States, however, a child's birth or adoption means stretched finances and unsettling concerns about whether caring for their child will cost them their jobs and jeopardize their families' financial security. 
Black Days for the Irish Economy | <PARAGRAPH> TULLYCROSS, IRELAND—Ten days after Irish citizens voted to ratify the proposed European Union fiscal austerity treaty, the sense of resignation about the gloomy economic situation seems heightened, especially in light of recent news that the vote will not mean an imminent re-entry to bond markets. Meanwhile, some expect Spain's bailout will make Ireland's prospects even worse. <PARAGRAPH> In a May 31 referendum, voters approved the treaty 60 to 40 percent, with voter turnout at about 50 percent. For the treaty to take effect, 12 Eurozone ccountries need to ratify it—a condition still in doubt given opposition in Greece, France and other countries. <PARAGRAPH> The treaty says a country's deficit cannot exceed 0.5 percent of its GDP; in 2011, Ireland's deficit equaled 9.4 percent of its GDP. Still Ireland has been considered the  poster child  or  good boy  for compliance with austerity measures previously mandated in order to receive bailouts—measures that treaty opponents blame for Ireland's 14 percent unemployment rate and ongoing economic stress. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Opponents—most notably the nationalist party Sinn Fein—had accused proponents of using fear to push for a yes vote, and they said that, contrary to treaty proponents' rhetoric, loans and bailout funds would still be available had voters refused the treaty. <PARAGRAPH> Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the treaty and Ireland's participation are key to European economic recovery and stability. But the days after the vote did little to bolster citizens' confidence and were described as an embarrassment for Kenny after his promises that a yes vote would ease woes. Credit agencies, including Fitch, announced that, despite the vote, Ireland's credit rating would not be upgraded and its ability to re-enter the bond markets remains unclear. <PARAGRAPH> Some had hoped that the yes vote would lead to a deal that would reduce Irish bank debt that taxpayers are mandated to repay, but Merkel and the European Central Bank denied that possibility. <PARAGRAPH>  This lady Merkel is just crazy about money,  the owner of a pub, store and inn on a rural road in County Mayo told me, noting his business has suffered greatly since the economy crashed. He thinks Ireland's compliance with austerity measures from the 2008 Lisbon Treaty did nothing to help, in the face of crippling bank debt.  They should just wipe the slate clean and start all over again, let us have a boom for another 20 years.  <PARAGRAPH> A number of people I talked with described the crippling levels of debt that most residents live with, even as the country appears relatively prosperous. <PARAGRAPH>  It's a facade, like a movie set,  said the owner of a bed and breakfast in the town of Westport.  People started building two and three houses, and now they can't pay for them ... so many were put up so fast they are terrible quality.  <PARAGRAPH> Indeed, there are many spacious, upscale large houses standing empty or unfinished throughout the lovely countryside, though it appears they are largely never-lived-in second homes or upgraded homes not carrying the specter of painful foreclosures and families thrown out on the street. <PARAGRAPH> It seems unclear to everyone exactly what the economic future holds, but residents do not feel optimistic and think they will get a raw deal under the fiscal treaty. On the social media politics site, Political World, one participant wrote: <PARAGRAPH>  If the Irish government could grow some balls in the very short week ahead, and close ranks with others in the same boat, they might learn a trick or two and possibly even get somewhere. [T]hey should know by now that trying to be teacher's pet isn't working. [T]hey're not even getting a pat on the head anymore.  <PARAGRAPH> Leaders on both sides of the treaty debate have invoked the importance of the free market, with treaty proponents saying a no vote would kill private investment and opponents saying private investment—in pharmaceutical manufacturing, information technology and the like—would continue even if Ireland refused the treaty. But there was bad news on the jobs front in the days after the vote. <PARAGRAPH> Pfizer  announced it would cut 177 jobs at two plants in County Cork, and the major public-private bus company Bus Éireann revealed plans to slash allowances, sick days, and holidays for 2,500 workers in an attempt to reduce payroll costs by €9 million annually and save €20 million annually. <PARAGRAPH> Another large bus company, Dublin Bus, announced similar cuts, and Irish Rail announced 450 voluntary redundancies. Bus Éireann said fuel costs and the loss of €6 million in state subsidies necessitated the cuts. The National Bus and Rail Union promised a standoff, saying the union would not accept the cuts. <PARAGRAPH> As for Pfizer, the Irish Independent quoted SIPTU union shop steward Gerry Sharma  saying:  The mood is very somber at the moment. Pfizer is a very good company to work for and these kinds of jobs won't come around again. There are a lot of people being made redundant who would have big mortgages and the jobs market is very bleak at the moment. It's just another black day in the Irish economy. 
Ireland Amidst Turf Wars, Literally | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> COUNTY MAYO, IRELAND — On the fog-enshrouded, windswept Atlantic coast of Ireland in County Mayo, the treeless bluffs where sheep ramble are dotted with odd pyramids of bricks of rich black sod arranged in neat rows. This is the  turf,  or strips of peat from ancient bogs, that for centuries rural residents have dried and burned to heat their homes. <PARAGRAPH> This is turf-cutting season, and turf has taken on special political and social significance related to everything from Ireland's battle for independence a century ago to the recent vote on the proposed EU austerity treaty. <PARAGRAPH> Under pressure from the European Union, Ireland banned cutting turf in certain  raised bogs  that are protected areas for environmental and historical reasons. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, reducing the burning of turf, considered a fossil fuel, is also central to Ireland's efforts to reduce carbon emissions as part of the EU's combined commitment under the Kyoto Protocol. Ireland has committed to reducing its emissions 20 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and peat—created by the decomposition of vegetation over hundreds of years—is highly carbon intensive. <PARAGRAPH> But the 53 areas designated as protected bogs are on land where families have cut turf for centuries, and many see the limits as a violation of their rights and of Irish sovereignty, as well as an impingement on their economic well-being. A recent survey of 21 of the protected areas found that turf was being cut illegally in 17 of them. <PARAGRAPH> Turf-cutting has become symbolic of the escalating resentment of the goverment among rural dwellers, and of divisions between rural and urban residents. Rural residents are also incensed about new taxes for septic tank inspections and other measures that they say threaten their traditional ways of life. Defending turf-cutting is part of the Standing Up for Rural Ireland campaign that nationalist party Sinn Fein invoked to rally opposition to the EU austerity treaty, which a majority of voters approved in the May 31 referendum. Treaty vote results aside, these stances helped Sinn Fein's popularity climb significantly in the past year. <PARAGRAPH> The Irish government has offered compensation to farmers for ceasing to cut peat on their family lands or offered them access to alternative unprotected bogs. But many have apparently found this solution unsatisfactory, doubting they will be adequately compensated and saying that they harvest turf in sustainable amounts developed over centures. Environmentalists counter that mechanized turf-cutting has changed things in recent years, and created large-scale commercial enterprises out of what used to be sustainable family activities. Turf-cutters oppose moves to demand commercial licenses for turf-selling among rural neighbors, and say turf is merely sold door to door by youths for pocket money. <PARAGRAPH> According to its website, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association fights to  defend the right of the Irish people to cut their own turf, for their own use, on their own turf banks, as our people have done for over 500 years and still our raised bogs remain some of the best protected in all of Europe.  <PARAGRAPH> The association proposed a reform plan of its own, which the government did not adopt, leading the association in March to call for its members to break off contact with the government and to vote no in the May 31 referendum on the austerity treaty with the turf-cutting limits in mind as  evidence of the anti-Democratic and dictatorial nature of the EU.  <PARAGRAPH> The integration of turf in the rural household and farming economies is evident when traveling through the country. Many roadside stands or gas stations sell turf as a home fuel, along with coal  much of it from Poland  and gas. In cozy pubs, many a fireplace is full of rich peat waiting to be burned. The air is often ripe with the acrid, loamy smell of burning peat. And in the bogs along the western coast, the land is furrowed  and carved in surreal shapes from turf-cutting. <PARAGRAPH> Over the Easter week in April, farmers cut turf in protected areas in a movement they referred to as a strike and commemorative of the Easter Uprising of 1916, when the Irish fought for independence from British rule. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, many government officials and urbanites say the turf-cutting limits and new taxes are only fair and necessary given current economic and environmental realities. <PARAGRAPH> A recent op ed by Dublin Institute of Technology economics lecturer Sean Byrne in the Irish Times said rural farmers should be held accountable for the extra infrastructure costs they create that are picked up by all taxpayers, and said it is a deluded notion that rural living is somehow more ecologically-friendly than dense urban living. He critiqued farmers for resisting environmental protections even as, he wrote, much of their income is ensured by EU farm policies. <PARAGRAPH> While government leaders say much progress has been made in reaching a compromise over the decade or so that turf-cutting has been controversial, the protests of turf-cutters during a meeting with EU officials in March shows the deeper issues involved are not going away any time soon. Protesters held signs saying  Sod Off EU  and told reporters that they don't need  men in suits  in Brussels or Dublin telling them what to do.
Hard Times in Free Derry | <PARAGRAPH>  DERRY, NORTHERN IRELAND -- The graffiti-marred images on the steep Eastway Wall in Derry's Creggan neighborhood tell stories of the area's tumultuous political, social and labor history. There are mentions of Bloody Sunday, the infamous 1972 massacre of participants in a non-violent Catholic civil rights march in Free Derry just down the street.  <PARAGRAPH>  There are also photos and text commemorating and explaining the area's less-famous labor history, which also speaks to the local spirit of resistance and current economic and social woes.  <PARAGRAPH>  Over the June 2-3 weekend, police raided homes in the Catholic Bogside and Creggan neighborhoods in advance of the Olympic torch relay on June 4. Residents called the raids an unjustified affront to their civil rights, and several bombs were thrown at police vehicles, including one just 15 minutes after I left the area on Saturday, that resulted in attempted murder charges.  <PARAGRAPH>  <PICTURE>  <PARAGRAPH>  These skirmishes show the economic and political challenges that residents still face 14 years after the Good Friday agreement. Despite vigorous efforts to heal divisions and create jobs and economic opportunities, Catholic residents are still disproportionately likely to be unemployed, after decades of severe discrimination and institutional inequality.  <PARAGRAPH>  Derry was once home to large factories making dress shirts, electronics and other products, with strong organizing by workers who harbored both  fondness and resentment  for their employers, as one plaque on the Eastway Wall notes. Hundreds of jobs were lost as factories closed, including the United Technologies Automotive  UTA  factory that closed in 1997, shedding 600 jobs. The closure of the Birmingham Sound Reproducers  BSR  factories that once employed more than 2,000 people making record players and tape decks was  devastating despite the sweatshop conditions and the inadequacy of the wages,  according to the Eastway Wall art project, part of the Re-Imaging Communities program meant to bring factions together and help people move past historical grievances through public art.  <PARAGRAPH>  While devoting significant space to the factories closed and jobs lost in the area, the Eastway plaques also note the creation of the Rath Mor Indigenous Enterprise Park, a grassroots  self-help  initiative wherein community members gained control of part of the old United Technologies Automotive factory as a home for local businesses. The plaque says:  <PARAGRAPH>   It is a story born of despair, but filled with hope—testimony to the commitment, courage and perseverance of remarkable people living in remarkable times in a remarkable place. ... The significance of the self-help ethos promoted and fostered by CEL  Creggan Enterprises Limited  is the foundation stone to ensure the revitalization of the area and has become the key structure for job creation.   <PARAGRAPH>  Northern Ireland actually has a lower official unemployment rate than the United Kingdom as a whole, but many are still dependent on government assistance or struggling to survive. There was a 70 percent increase in people on the dole in the past year, and unemployment rates have traditionally been higher among Catholics in Derry.  <PARAGRAPH>  About one in five youth in Northern Ireland are classified as unemployed. Recent news stories note that only one in 10 teachers completing certification can expect to get a job in Northern Ireland, because of budget cuts and dropping student enrollment.  <PARAGRAPH>  Government and private agencies are aggressively pushing tourism as an economic engine, with a special Northern Ireland Summer campaign running that coincides with the opening of a big, permanent Titanic exhibit in Belfast, where the doomed ship was built. A Belfast storefront employment agency is plastered with banners and fliers announcing jobs at the Titanic museum, and bars and stores are filled with Titanic memorabilia.  <PARAGRAPH>  Northern Ireland tourism promoters are even ardently trying to woo  Olympic refugees —thousands of London residents who are expected to flee their homes because of chaos and security concerns during the Olympics this summer. The Belfast Telegraph reported that one in four Londoners are expected to leave the city during the Games, and Northern Ireland has already seen a big uptick in tourism with 60,000 more visitors this year than last.  <PARAGRAPH>  Tourism would likely be hurt by continued political violence, which is not a thing of the past as evidenced by incidents such as attempted bombings allegedly by Republican Irish dissidents in Newry and Belfast in April, the recent incidents in Derry, and ongoing mistreatment of Republican prisoners by majority British loyalist police forces.  <PARAGRAPH>  Drug addiction and vigilante action against drug dealers have also reportedly become serious problems in Derry and Belfast, with Northern Ireland deputy first minister and long-time Republican leader Martin McGuinness saying that members of a group called Republican Action Against Drugs  RAAD , which took credit for the June 3 bomb, are  the new oppressors of the people of Derry.   <PARAGRAPH>  The group reportedly exiles on average four young men from Derry each week, and also has maimed and killed young men accused of drug dealing if they refuse to give up dealing after being warned. The Guardian reported last month:  <PARAGRAPH>   In some instances those targeted, mostly in their teens or early 20s, have been forced to turn up with a parent or relative to a pre-arranged appointment to be wounded for alleged drug dealing or other supposed crimes.   <PARAGRAPH>  As in many places, the abuse of drugs and the incentive to deal is closely linked to economic conditions and social disenfranchisement. In a gruesome irony, some Irish Republicans' efforts to curb the scourge of abuse in their own communities appears to have perversely morphed into the type of violence and terror visited on them for so long. McGuinness and other critics also said RAAD targets people who have nothing to do with drugs, or who are powerless victims of addiction, not major dealers. He and other Republican leaders have called for RAAD's disbanding.  <PARAGRAPH>  On a short visit, I saw people who seemed very obviously to be struggling with unemployment and drug addiction, and I happened to catch some of the political violence. But I couldn't tell how the Creggan indigenous enterprise project or other  self-help  development efforts are faring. One can only hope such efforts born out of decades of struggle against inequality and marginalization will triumph over continued institutional injustice, violence and cycles of conflict.
N.Y. Times covers CEO's role in BBC sex abuse scandal | The New York Times is up with a new story on Mark Thompson, the embattled former BBC head and incoming president and CEO of The New York Times Co. <paragraph> The article —  British Parliament Questions Former BBC Chief’s Role <hyperlink>    — details the shift in public statements from Thompson regarding what and when he knew about the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse investigation. The Times, which sat down with the former BBC director general on Tuesday, also featured another interview in Wednesday's piece about his knowledge of the spiked ”Newsnight” program.  “At no point does either Caroline [Hawley, the journalist who told him of the investigation in 2011] or the senior news managers ever specify exactly what is in the ‘Newsnight,’ what lines of inquiry they’re adopting or what was alleged,” he told the Times. “There was no detail given at all. Neither before that period or after that period did anyone raise complaints. I knew about its existence. But I was told, however, the program decided to stop it.” <paragraph>  I was not given any detail of what the program had been investigating,  he added. <paragraph> Thompson also noted that “I can’t remember one where I was notified or briefed. There wasn’t a single example of ‘Newsnight’ referring programs that they got so high that they were referred to the director general.” <paragraph> The article mentioned the parliamentary hearing Tuesday that  featured an uncomfortable and apologetic George Entwistle, the current director general  and detailed the letters sent from members regarding Thompson's role, including one from former BBC producer Roger Gale that said Thompson was paid “to, apparently, not know what was going on under his own roof.”  <paragraph> As for whether Thompson will testify, John Whittingdale, the chairman of the parliamentary committee that held the hearing told the Times,  At the moment, we’re told he had no knowledge of the ‘Newsnight’ investigation. If reasons arise to talk to him, we will do so.   
Nocera questions Mark Thompson hire | The New York Times’s Joe Nocera pointedly asks in his Tuesday column if incoming New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson, who is facing questions over the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, is right for the job. <paragraph>  In his column <hyperlink> , Nocera lays out the timeline of Thompson’s public statements on what he knew and when about the spiked Savile investigation and asks whether The New York Times Co. made the right call with this hire. Thompson is set to start his new gig as the president and CEO of The New York Times Co. on Nov. 12. <paragraph>   Also on POLITICO: N.Y. Times covers CEO's role in BBC sex abuse scandal <hyperlink>   “His nameplate is already on his office door. He is getting to know Times employees. Yet, since early October, all anybody has asked about Thompson are those two most damning of questions: What did he know, and when did he know it?” Nocera wrote. <paragraph>  The various statements Thompson has made <hyperlink>— that he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being killed, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011 — are worrisome, Nocera wrote. <paragraph> “Thompson winds up appearing willfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organization the BBC was when Thompson was running it — and what kind of leader he was. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he’d be at The Times,” he wrote. <paragraph>  Also on POLITICO: NYT CEO addresses BBC sex abuse scandal  <hyperlink>  New York Times Co. Chairman “Arthur Sulzberger is in a difficult spot,” he noted. Sulzberger, who declined Nocera’s interview request, “appears to have accepted Thompson’s insistence that he knew nothing about the explosive allegations that became public literally 50 days after he accepted the Times job. Sulzberger is backing his man unreservedly.” <paragraph> “For the sake of Times employees — not to mention the readers who want to see a vibrant New York Times Company — let’s hope his faith in Thompson is warranted. Otherwise, the BBC won’t be the only organization being asked tough questions about its judgment,” Nocera wrote. <paragraph>  
Sandy crashes BuzzFeed, Gawker, HuffPo | Hurricane Sandy took down BuzzFeed, The Huffington Post, Mediaite and Gawker on Monday night as the storm ripped through New York City. <paragraph> Datagram — the Internet service provider these media groups use to host their websites — was flooded, causing the outage, an official told BuzzFeed last night. <paragraph>  “Basement flooded, fuel pump off line — we got people working on it now. 5 feet of water now,” the official wrote, according to BuzzFeed’s Tumblr <hyperlink> . <paragraph>  BuzzFeed, which is telling users today on its front page that it is “recovering from Sandy” as its main page isn’t updated, is using Tumblr, Twittter and Facebook to provide content. <paragraph>  BuzzFeed editor in chief Ben Smith wrote to staffers on Monday night that “we're having some hurricane related issues with our servers, but that shouldn't prevent us from getting up the great content we are trying to get up this evening. … We will, I hope, switch back to buzzfeed soon, but no point waiting.” <paragraph>  Meanwhile, The Huffington Post’s communications director Rhoades Alderson told Poynter <hyperlink> that “our data center, our backup data center, and its three data providers all failed overnight due to Sandy.” “The HuffPost and Aol tech teams are working closely with them to restore service. In the meantime, we’re redirecting to a simple Blogsmith page with all of our breaking news — one power vertical — until we’re back up,” Alderson wrote to Poynter. <paragraph>  On Monday, Gawker tweeted <hyperlink> the site was “temporarily down because the 57th Street Crane just flooded our servers with sea foam, or something. Back with you shortly” — but today,Gawker told readers  <hyperlink>via Twitter that “we're posting on old-school Gawker this morning while our server recovers from the storm. Come join: live.gawker.com.” <paragraph>  And Mediaite tweeted <hyperlink> to readers last night it was also temporarily down, but has had no further updates.  
WaPo: Paper declines amid company growth | The Washington Post Co. reported higher earnings in its third quarter, but the newspaper division had declines in advertising and circulation, according to a report on Friday. <paragraph>  Newspaper and online news revenue dropped four percent to $137.3 million and print advertising fell 11 percent to $51.4 million, The Washington Post reported <hyperlink>. The revenue from online ventures such as Slate and washingtonpost.com, however, jumped 13 percent to $26.9 million, and online ad display revenue went up 18 percent. <paragraph>  The division had an operating loss of $21.8 million, although the Post noted “that figure included a non-cash pension expense of $16.2 million.” <paragraph>  The Post did not issue its circulation figures for the third-quarter, but the paper stated it “continued to slide.” The Post noted one positive figure — there was a nine percent drop in newsprint costs. <paragraph>  The company’s broadcast division was most successful, and political advertising went up $15.6 million, the Post reported. <paragraph>  Revenue for the third quarter was flat at $1.01 billion, and overall, the company reported a profit of $93.8 million, or $12.64 a share. A year ago this quarter, the company reported a loss of $6.2 million, or 82 cents a share. After operation costs, restructuring at Kaplan and the newspaper and other charges, the company had a net income of $44.7 million, or $6.03 per share, a boost from the figures from a year ago at $12.6 million, or $1.59 per share.   
NYT public editor: Silver bet 'bad idea' | The New York Times' public editor Margaret Sullivan says Nate Silver's offer to bet on the winner of the presidential election was a “bad idea” that gives “ammunition to the critics” who want to paint him as a partisan. <paragraph>  Silver, the Times’ political statistician, bet MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough  <hyperlink> $1,000 — and then $2,000 — that President Barack Obama would win the election. Sullivan blasted the wager in an afternoon column headlined  Under Attack, Nate Silver Picks the Wrong Defense <hyperlink> .  <paragraph>  “But whatever the motivation behind it, the wager offer is a bad idea – giving ammunition to the critics who want to paint Mr. Silver as a partisan who is trying to sway the outcome,” Sullivan wrote. “It’s also inappropriate for a Times journalist, which is how Mr. Silver is seen by the public even though he’s not a regular staff member. <paragraph>  Silver, who spoke with Sullivan by phone Thursday, said the wager is “half playful and half serious.” <paragraph>  “He’s been on a rant, calling me an idiot and a partisan, so I’m asking him to put some integrity behind it,” he told Sullivan. “I don’t stand to gain anything from it; it’s for charity.” <paragraph>  That’s not how Sullivan sees it: the move was  inappropriate for a Times journalist, which is how Mr. Silver is seen by the public even though he’s not a regular staff member,  she writes. Times’ associate managing editor for standards Philip Corbett told Sullivan that “I wouldn’t want to see it become newsroom practice.” <paragraph> Sullivan added that when Silver — “probably” the Times’ “most high-profile writer at this particular moment”— came to work at the paper, he “gained a lot more visibility and the credibility associated with a prominent institution.” <paragraph> “But he lost something, too: the right to act like a free agent with responsibilities to nobody’s standards but his own,” she wrote.   
Sulzberger: BBC scandal 'hasn’t made things easy' | New York Times Co. chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said chief executive Mark Thompson's connection to the BBC's Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal  hasn’t made things easy,  according to a report. <paragraph> “The British stuff hasn’t made things easy,” Sulzberger told Bloomberg News <hyperlink> on Tuesday night. “But Mark is a good man.” <paragraph>  Thompson, who is facing questions over his role at the BBC concerning the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal <hyperlink> , started his new gig at the Times on Nov. 12. Sulzberger, who did not elaborate on the  British stuff,  added that he was pleased to finally have the CEO position filled, Bloomberg News reported. “We are very happy to have him in the position after all that time,” he said. <paragraph>  Controversy continues to swirl around Thompson, formerly BBC director general, who has said he was not involved <hyperlink>  in killing the BBC “Newsnight” investigation into Savile. He has said he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being spiked, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011.  
Twitter suspends, reactivates 'NYT On It' account after Times complaint | Twitter has now restored the popular New York Times parody account it suspended on Monday after the Times filed a complaint against it. <paragraph>  Benjamin Kabak, the 29-year-old lawyer behind the account, told POLITICO that Twitter reenabled the account Tuesday morning but threatened him with permanent deletion if they receive another complaint. Kabak removed the account avatar, the reason for the Times' complaint, and is opening a design contest to replace the canned icon. <paragraph>  The @NYTOnIt account — which pokes fun at some lifestyle and trend stories in the Times — had over 20,000 followers prior to its suspension and is known for tweets such as this one from Nov. 13: “GUYS, there are *gasp* fake profiles on Facebook, and The Times is ON IT.http:  nyti.ms TDt1ut  . The Twitter bio read: “Because sometimes stories in newspapers are just *that* obvious.  It also now includes the added statement,  This is a parody account clearly not associated with any newspaper.  <paragraph> “Twitter has suspended my account over a claim from The Times that my avatar violates a trademark,” Kabak wrote Monday night on The Times Is On It Facebook page <hyperlink> . “I say fair use. Right now, I'm waiting for Twitter to process my request to fix the problem so I can get the account reenabled. But feel free to spread the word over how the country's largest newspaper feels threatened by a small Twitter account right now.” Times spokesperson Eileen Murphy wrote in an e-mail to POLITICO on Tuesday that “this is not about feeling ‘threatened.’” <paragraph> “We did file a complaint with Twitter and it is our understanding that they have suspended this account for a violation of Twitter's terms of service,” Murphy wrote. “This is not about feeling ‘threatened.’ However, it is important to The Times that our copyright is protected and that it is clear to all users of Twitter that parody accounts or other unofficial Times accounts are not affiliated nor endorsed by The Times.” <paragraph>   Murphy wrote in a follow-up email to clarify that  this is really a trademark issue, not a copyright issue. My earlier note used copyright where I should have said trademark.  <paragraph> abak also noted on Facebook that “I have filed an appeal with Twitter so I may remove the materials they claim are problematic.” <paragraph> “They say, ‘We are usually able to respond within a few days, but some issues may take longer.’ A few days for something that isn't actually legally infringing seems particularly egregious. We'll see how long that takes,  he wrote. <paragraph>  Kabak told POLITICO he had gotten a “heads-up” email from someone on Monday that the Times was likely to file a complaint with Twitter. He then posted a message asking that anyone who felt he was doing something wrong with the account contact him offline so he could deal with the situation. Kabak, however, later received an email from Twitter that his account was “temporarily suspended.” Kabak said he immediately replied to the email saying he wanted to correct the situation, but noted that although he could sign into his account, he could not make any of the changes Twitter said he needed to make regarding the avatar. <paragraph> Kabak said a few people at the Times “who know I am behind the account and have been fans of it for a while” reached out to him after the suspension, but he said he was not contacted directly by anyone in the legal department at the Times. <paragraph> Kabak, who said he started the account on a  whim  last summer after making jokes on his personal Twitter about certain lifestyle stories in the paper, said his dealings with Twitter and the Times left him unimpressed with the respective ways they handled his situation. <paragraph>  I think this is not a particularly great reflection on the Times’ process or Twitter’s process because it’s not particularly transparent,  Kabak told POLITICO just moments before the account was restored.  They pulled down the account without really finding out the information from me.    
Nate Silver on 'Morning Joe': Why pollsters got it wrong | <video> <paragraph> New York Times statistician Nate Silver stopped by MSNBC's “Morning Joe  on Tuesday to discuss how he got it right this election when so many others didn’t. <paragraph>  Host Joe Scarborough — who during the campaign questioned Silver for calling the race decisively <hyperlink>  for President Barack Obama — kicked off the sit-down by addressing their infamous bet. <hyperlink> “We didn't bet because we love humanity too much to bet, but I think we gave money and we made a contribution, in Nate’s name, to AmeriCares,” Scarborough said. <paragraph>  After Scarborough joked that “the first thing I want to do — before your apology to me — is let’s sell books,” Silver discussed why so many polls were wrong this year and incorrectly called it as a much closer race for Mitt Romney. Silver said most of the major network polls — NBC Wall Street Journal, ABC Washington Post, CBS New York Times — are “pretty good,  while the polls that faltered made too many assumptions about the population. <paragraph> “I think that high-quality polling really differentiates itself now because if you take an automated poll, you miss people who have cellphones, which is about a third of the population now,” Silver said. “And they're mostly younger urban demographic, mostly Democrats, so you will undersample Democrats, to use that buzzword, if you don't call people who have cellphones. And lo and behold, those polls had a Republican bias this year. Not because the pollsters are evil partisan, but because, hey, if you miss a big chunk of the population that's Democratic-leaning, you're going to have problems.” <paragraph>  The best pollsters, Silver said, “let the sample tell you what it is by themselves.” The ones who didn’t “put their finger on the scale” and didn’t make assumptions about the voting public were most successful. <paragraph> “Just going with what the data said instead of making assumptions is usually the best practice whenever you're doing any kind of scientific survey and that worked again this year,” Silver said. <paragraph>  As for Romney, Silver called the Republican a  B-, C+ candidate  with an “adequate  campaign that just couldn’t cut it against the powerful advantage held by an incumbent president. <paragraph> “I think Neil Newhouse, the pollster there, I think those guys are pretty smart guys with a frankly, B-, C+ candidate, ran a pretty close campaign,” Silver said. <paragraph>   But it’s already time to look past this cycle, Silver said. <paragraph> “I’m a pro-horserace guy. I’m more interested in diagnosing 2016 now than Benghazi, for example, because that’s where my bread is buttered,” Silver said. “But if you’re going to do horserace, then do it the right way because it can be more data driven.” <paragraph> ack in late October, Scarborough had blasted Silver’s statistical process. <paragraph>  And anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a tossup right now is such an ideologue, they should be kept away from typewriters, computers, laptops and microphones for the next 10 days, because they're jokes,” Scarborough said on “Morning Joe.” <paragraph>   As the interview wrapped on Tuesday, Scarborough, who noted earlier in the show he had predicted an Obama win, invited Silver to come back after the pair joked about sports.   
CHC: NYT's Douthat 'reaffirms the obvious reasons' GOP lost Latinos | The Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Monday blasted The New York Times’ Ross Douthat’s new column as a  rambling piece which reflects his lack of understanding of the diverse Latino community and reaffirms the obvious reasons that Republicans lost Latino support.” <paragraph>  CHC chair Charlie Gonzalez took aim at Douthat for writing in his Sunday column “The Liberal Gloat <hyperlink> ” that one of the major reasons Democrats are winning the support of recent immigrants is “because those immigrants often aren’t assimilating successfully — or worse, are assimilating downward, thanks to rising out-of-wedlock birthrates and high dropout rates.” <paragraph>  “The Democratic edge among Hispanics depends heavily on these darker trends: the weaker that families and communities are, the more necessary government support inevitably seems,” Douthat wrote. <paragraph>  “Hispanics are not a separate part of America,” Gonzales said in a statement responding to the op-ed column. “We are engaged in every facet of American society and successful Latinos ensure a more prosperous America.  To say that Latinos are assimilating downward is to ignore the obvious facts.” <paragraph>  The Texas representative noted that “immigrants do not come to this country out of laziness. They come to work toward a better life and no one can question the work ethic of Latinos.” <paragraph>“Latinos seek assimilation, which requires equality with and inclusion in the dominant and established American community. The Republican agenda and policies offered neither and that's why Latinos voted for the Democratic candidates,” the CHC chair added. “The Latino story is the American story. It’s a simple lesson, but one that some conservatives, such as Mr. Douthat, are still learning.” <paragraph>  Douthat has not yet responded to a request for comment.   
ABC's Tapper on 'The Outpost,' Petraeus |  <video>  <paragraph> ABC’s Jake Tapper stopped by POLITICO LIVE on Wednesday to discuss his new book “The Outpost.  <paragraph> Tapper, ABC News’ senior White House correspondent, said he was watching the news in 2009, just after his son was born, when he caught a report about an “unbelievable attack” on Combat Outpost Keating. <paragraph>  They faced down 400 Taliban,” he said. “And it was weird because I was holding my son and hearing about eight other sons being taken from this world. And it became a mystery that I wanted to solve — why would anybody put a base there, who were these guys, what’s it like to be in such a precarious and vulnerable place facing this onslaught from Taliban fighters? And it became a real mission and cause for me, and it became this book three years later.” <paragraph>  Tapper also addressed the David Petraeus scandal, telling POLITICO he didn’t hear any rumblings of an affair while he was reporting. “These guys were a world away,” Tapper. <paragraph> “To think about Petraeus bringing Paula Broadwell with him to Afghanistan in the context of what these guys went through in my book — it’s just unbelievable,” he said. “And it also makes me offended because, why was he bringing a biographer with him? Why wasn’t he bringing somebody to write this book, my book, telling the story of the troops?” <paragraph> “It’s just so narcissistic,” Tapper said. <paragraph> While Tapper noted he had covered the war in Afghanistan before taking on the project, “it was from the comfort of the North Lawn of the White House.” <paragraph> “It was debating troop levels, 10,000, 40,000, you know, and those numbers, in retrospect, we bat them around in this town. It’s kind of cold,” he said. <paragraph>  “This book focuses on a battle in which there are eight guys who are killed,” he added. “And I could rattle off their names right now. Behind every one of those guys there’s a grieving mom or widow or brother or sister, or a child who will never know their dad. Those numbers now mean much more to me than 40,000, 30,000, and I think I have a much richer understanding of war.”
