House Dems dominated by 4 states |   <paragraph>  The University of Minnesota’s  <hyperlink>  Smart Politics blog looks at the composition of the 113th Congress and reports that the House Democratic Caucus will be dominated by two big blue states:  <paragraph>    Californians and New Yorkers will comprise a record percentage of the Democratic caucus when the 113th Congress convenes in January at nearly 30 percent.  <paragraph>  Although gains by Democrats were modest in 2012 U.S. House races — netting eight seats nationwide — the delegations from two coastal states still managed to increase their ever-growing influence on the party.  <paragraph>  For despite the State of New York losing two seats due to reapportionment after the 2010 U.S. Census, the Democratic Party saw the percentage of its caucus from the Empire State and California delegations increase to an all-time high — now just shy of 30 percent of the 201 seats it will hold across the country in January.  <paragraph>  A Smart Politics analysis of 83 general election cycles dating back to 1850 finds that the Democratic Party now composes a larger percentage of Californians and New Yorkers in the U.S. House than at any point since California joined the Union.   <paragraph>  If you add in Illinois and Massachusetts, then 40 percent of the Democratic Caucus hails from just four blue states.  <paragraph>  There’s a danger, of course, when such a high proportion of members hail from just a few states. As the GOP is learning from its overreliance on the South, it’s easy to develop a tin ear when a party is too concentrated in states where the political climate is unrepresentative of the nation as a whole.
The GOP's 2012 diversity disaster | <picture>   <paragraph>  Florida Republican Rep. Allen West’s   <hyperlink>  concession Tuesday makes it official: The 2012 election was a disaster for the GOP’s efforts to diversify the face of the party.  <paragraph>  The number of African-American Republicans in Congress, which stood to double thanks to several highly competitive candidates, was instead cut in half. In addition to West’s reelection loss, top House prospects Vernon Parker in Arizona and Mia Love in Utah also fell short, leaving Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina as the lone black GOP House member in the 113th Congress.  <paragraph>  In a year when a record number of Hispanics were elected to Congress, Republicans also ended up losing two of their already small contingent: Reps. Francisco Canseco of Texas and David Rivera of Florida, both of whom were defeated in their bids for a second term.  <paragraph>  In addition, the party failed to elect one of its most promising Hispanic candidates, former California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado, and saw GOP Gov. Luis Fortuño defeated in Puerto Rico.  <paragraph>  In the Senate, which will have a record number of women next year, the number of female Republican senators declined by one. While Republican Deb Fischer was elected to Nebraska’s open Senate seat, five other female GOP nominees lost — placing the number of GOP women in the Senate at 4.  <paragraph>  Meanwhile, Democrats elected 4 new women and re-elected 6 female Senate incumbents, giving the party 16 female senators.  <paragraph>  There was one promising sign this year for the GOP amid the lost opportunities: The election of Ted Cruz to an open Texas Senate seat. His victory means the party now boasts Hispanic senators in two of the nation’s largest states  the other is Florida’s Marco Rubio .  <paragraph>  Since the GOP can also point to two Hispanic governors  Democrats have none , Republicans are now arguably better positioned than Democrats to put a Hispanic on the presidential ticket in 2016.
The power of Calif.'s ethnic vote|   <paragraph>  Mitt Romney lost California by a landslide this year, but exit polls revealed he made big gains with one important demographic: white voters. In 2008, white Californians voted 52 to 46 percent for President Obama. In 2012, they flipped and voted 53-45 for Romney.  <paragraph>  In the end, though, it made almost no difference. Romney improved over John McCain’s weak 2008 performance by just 1 percentage point.  <paragraph>  Mark DiCamillo, director of California’s Field Poll,  <hyperlink>  explains the tectonic forces that made Romney’s gains largely irrelevant:  <paragraph>   When I first began polling at The Field Poll in the late 1970s, the influence of ethnic voters [Latinos, Asian Americans and African Americans] on California election outcomes was less, and top-of-the-ticket races were typically more competitive affairs, with each party winning their share of the elections. For example, in the 16 elections for president, U.S. Senate and governor between 1978 and 1994, Republican candidates won nine times, while Democrats won seven times.  <paragraph>  The 1994 election marked a turning point, as ethnic voter participation began its ascent…  <paragraph>  A comparison of Field Poll estimates of the composition of the state's registered voters in 1994 to what it is today illustrates the dramatic effect that the growth in ethnic voters has had on the electorate over the past 18 years.  <paragraph>  In 1994 there were 14.7 million registered voters in California. Today there are 18.2 million voters.  <paragraph>  Of the 3.5 million voter increase over this period, about 3 million — or nearly 90 percent of it — came from Latino and Asian American voters.   <paragraph>  This year’s exit polls suggest a dramatic change in the composition of the California electorate in just the past four years: The white share of the vote was 63 percent in 2008, then dropped to 55 percent in 2012.  <paragraph>  Demographic change isn’t the only story here. DiCamillo concludes that the best explanation for the growth in Latino, Asian-American and African-American support for Democratic candidates relates to their view of the role of government.  <paragraph>  While California's white non-Hispanics are evenly divided on whether the government should do more to solve the nation's problems, ethnic voters believe that government should be doing more by nearly 2 to 1.
The war on Charlie Crist |   <paragraph>   <picture>  <paragraph>  As former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist looks more and more like a Democratic prospect for governor in 2014, the Florida GOP is ramping up its efforts to damage his political brand:  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  Tthe Associated Press: “ When Crist says something nice about President Barack Obama, the state GOP immediately shoots out a press release with something not so nice Crist said about Obama when he was a Republican. If Crist endorses a Democratic candidate, the party reminds people Crist used to say he was a Ronald Reagan Republican… “I just think Charlie Crist is bad for the state of Florida,” said state GOP Chairman Lenny Curry. “He’s someone who’s trying to recreate himself. These are serious times. At any level, we don’t want to see Charlie Crist back in office, particularly in a position of leadership. It wouldn’t be good for Florida, regardless of your ideology.” The idea is this: defeat Crist before he can re-emerge as a political candidate with a D next to his name. The unusual part is Crist isn’t a candidate and the attacks began before the 2012 election was decided. It breaks traditional election strategy for a party to begin airing campaign ads for the next election cycle while in the middle of another. “I don’t recall it ever being done,” said David Johnson, a Tallahassee-based Republican political consultant. “It is unusual and it is unprecedented, but so is Charlie Crist.” ”  <paragraph>  It’s hard to overstate the level of disdain many Florida Republicans have for Crist, so in one sense, the Crist-bashing isn’t a surprise.  <paragraph>  But there’s some risk in an over-the-top approach — the more the GOP attacks Crist, who hasn’t even registered as a Democrat yet, the more he could look like a sympathetic character to his prospective party.  <paragraph>  The track record for recent high-profile party-switchers isn’t great: Former Alabama Rep. Parker Griffith lost by a wide margin in a 2010 GOP primary following his switch from the Democratic Party, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was also rejected by his new party in a 2010 Democratic primary after he switched from the GOP side.  <paragraph>  There’s one big difference, though, between those party-switchers and Crist. Griffith and Specter both ran for reelection in the same election cycle that they switched parties, leaving them little time or opportunity to establish a trusting relationship with their new parties.  <paragraph>  Crist, on the other hand, will have plenty of distance from the Republican Party by 2014, and lots of time to do the necessary spadework with the Democratic grass-roots. By then, four years will have passed since he left the GOP. He’s already begun the process of generating political goodwill by supporting Democratic candidates and emerging as a prominent backer of President Obama — and by attracting the ire of the Florida GOP.
Obama's big county blowouts | <picture> Courtesy of Larry J. Sabato's Crystal Ball  <paragraph>  Here’s a stat that provides a measure of how thoroughly the GOP presidential ticket got thrashed in the “urban areas” Paul Ryan referred to: Mitt Romney lost 44 of the nation’s top 50 most populous counties on Election Day, a significant fall off from George W. Bush’s 2000 performance in those places.  <paragraph>  According to an analysis by Larry Sabato’s   <hyperlink>  Crystal Ball website, Bush won 16 big counties in his first bid, compared to just 6 for Romney. The majority of those counties weren’t close in 2012 — President Barack Obama won more than 55 percent of the vote in 34 of them.  <paragraph>  Many of the top 50 counties include big cities and have majority minority populations, so the results sketch out the full contours of the GOP’s weakness in urban America and among minority voters.  <paragraph>  The Crystal Ball research suggests the problem is getting worse in many places, not better. Consider Los Angeles County, the nation’s single largest county. In 1988, Michael Dukakis won 52-47 there. By 2000, the margin was 64-32 for Al Gore. This year, Obama won 69-29.  <paragraph>  Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County is a similar story: 59-40 Dukakis in 1988, 63-33 Gore in 2000 and 69-30 Obama in 2012.  <paragraph>  Even the big counties that once favored the GOP are drifting out of the party’s orbit as they diversify.  <paragraph>  In 1988, Charlotte’s Mecklenburg County gave George H.W. Bush 59 percent of the vote. By 2000, the GOP advantage in North Carolina’s most populous county was down to 51-48. This year, Barack Obama won 61-38.  <paragraph>  Then there’s Orange County, Calif. — the onetime conservative stronghold that Ronald Reagan called the place “where good Republicans go to die.”  <paragraph>  GOP presidential performance there declined from 68 percent in 1988 to 53 percent in 2012. The good news for Republicans? That 53 percent represents an uptick from John McCain’s 50 percent in 2008.
An early abortion rights test for Dems |   <paragraph>  The Democratic Party’s full and unyielding embrace of abortion rights in 2012 – a subtle but conspicuous repositioning – is about to be tested in a contest for the top Democratic slot on the powerful Appropriations Committee between Reps. Nita Lowey and Marcy Kaptur.  <paragraph>  From a report Sunday in  <hyperlink>  The Hill: “ A key factor in the race is abortion. Lowey’s camp argues she is more reliable in preventing anti-abortion rights legislation from being inserted into appropriations bills. Kaptur’s camp notes she has opposed riders defunding Planned Parenthood. Lowey, her office acknowledges, is emphasizing her pro-abortion rights positions. According to NARAL, Lowey has a 100 percent ranking on abortion-related issues, while Kaptur is “mixed-choice” at 70 percent. ”  <paragraph>  While support for abortion rights isn’t the only issue at play in the competition for the ranking Democratic position on the spending panel, the debate provides a window into the priorities and current thinking in the caucus.  <paragraph>  When Republicans chose a new chairman after the 2010 election, the battle lines were drawn over pork-barreling practices and appropriations reform.
Georgia GOPers fall short |  <paragraph>  The Georgia Tipsheet blog   <hyperlink>  notes that the House GOP leadership elections were a flop for Georgia, which saw two members of its delegation fall short. <paragraph>  Rep. Tom Price lost to Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Wednesday in his bid to become conference chairman while Rep. Tom Graves lost Thursday in his attempt to head the Republican Study Committee.  <paragraph>  While it’s a blow to Georgia interests, the outcomes are probably a net plus for the House GOP in the wake of an election that underscored the party’s weakness in competing with women and in regions outside the South.  <paragraph>  Had Price and Graves won the posts they vied for, top House leadership would have consisted of 5 white males, three of them from the South. The new team will now have one woman at the table, and will have more regional balance – two from the West  McMorris Rodgers and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California , a Midwesterner in Speaker John Boehner and two Southerners, Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and Republican Study Committee Chair Steve Scalise of Louisiana.  <paragraph>  Still, the GOP's congressional wing has a ways to go in presenting a different face to voters. As POLITICO's Manu Raju and Jake Sherman   <hyperlink>  report, the House and Senate GOP chose four women lawmakers out of 14 spots for senior leadership positions.
Scott Brown's comeback tour |  <picture>  <paragraph>  He might have lost his Senate seat last week, but Scott Brown is still very much in the game.  <paragraph>  Between the 2014 Massachusetts governor’s race and the swirling rumors regarding a possible Cabinet position for Sen. John Kerry, several promising   <hyperlink>  opportunities might soon present themselves to Brown.  <paragraph>  In a media availability Tuesday in Washington, the senator dodged questions about his future.  <paragraph>  “I have a job to do right now and there is not an opening right now for governor, nor is there an opening for senator,”  <hyperlink>  Brown said. “But there is an opening for a dad and a husband and that’s the role that I want to play.”  <paragraph>  Given his track record — a giant special election upset and a respectable loss in his bid to win a full term — and the Massachusetts GOP’s thin bench, Brown has far more leverage than the typical election loser in choosing an avenue of return.  <paragraph>  If he’s interested in returning to the Senate, however, Brown is looking at a daunting scenario. If Kerry steps down, Brown would have to run next year in a 2013 Senate special election, followed by the regularly scheduled 2014 election for the full six-year term. That would make four grueling statewide campaigns in five years in a heavily Democratic state — the 2010 special, the 2012 general election against Elizabeth Warren, a 2013 special and a 2014 general.
Dem. Senate incumbents outpaced Obama | <picture> Image courtesy of PoliticsPA  <paragraph>  The website   <hyperlink>  PoliticsPA crunches the numbers and finds that Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, whose lead appeared to be narrowing late in the campaign, ended up outperforming President Barack Obama nearly everywhere in Pennsylvania — including Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Casey wasn’t alone in running ahead of the president: Every Senate Democratic incumbent on the ballot, with the exception of Maryland’s Ben Cardin, outpaced Obama this year. So did a handful of challengers, including Tim Kaine of Virginia, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.  <paragraph>  None ran quite so far ahead of the ticket as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who was 25 percentage points ahead of the president and won 160,000 more votes than Obama — a stunning number for such a small state.  <paragraph>  How weak was Obama’s performance in West Virginia? Not only did he lose all 55 counties, he even won fewer votes than Manchin’s GOP opponent, John Raese.
Romney's Oakland County blues |   <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  The Detroit Free Press captures Republican hand-wringing after another presidential loss in Michigan’s Oakland County, a one-time GOP suburban stronghold that again eluded the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  Without the county, the state’s second-most populous after Detroit’s Wayne County, Mitt Romney had no chance of carrying the state where he was born.  <paragraph>    Locally, Oakland County voters gave Democrats four of the six countywide offices — prosecutor, treasurer, clerk and water resources commissioner — and successfully recalled Republican Troy Mayor Janice Daniels, a tea party supporter who was targeted after anti-gay comments and her promise to derail federal funding for a transit center in the city …  <paragraph>   I think it surprised a lot of people who didn't really recognize the county they thought they knew: We're not the rock-ribbed Republican stronghold that we were 20 years ago,  [former Oakland County GOP chairman Paul Welday] said.  And look, we had six white guys running for the countywide offices. We don't always look and sound as much like the voters around us as we should.  <paragraph>   We've got to become more relevant to voters of all stripes.   <paragraph>  The numbers back up Welday's assertion. Demographics helped push Oakland blue. As Detroit and Wayne County lost population, Oakland County's population grew more diverse, with the number of minority residents growing by nearly 10percent from 2000 to 2010, literally helping to change the face of the county's electorate.   <paragraph>  Romney’s local connections make his 54-46 loss there an especially bitter pill to swallow — he grew up in Oakland County, and his father served as governor of Michigan.  <paragraph>  While he ran 4 points ahead of John McCain’s pace in 2008, the fact that a candidate as well-suited for the area as Romney couldn’t win there is a telling sign of how damaged the GOP brand is in many of the Midwestern and Northeastern suburbs.  <paragraph>  While exit polls report Romney carried the suburbs 50-48 overall, he still fell short in many of the populous suburban counties that reliably powered GOP victories for decades — places like Oakland County.
Polls: Romney running out of time | New polls released by the New York Times and Quinnipiac today suggest that Mitt Romney is running out of time in his fight to win the White House. <paragraph> With President Obama maintaining his five-point lead in Ohio in today's poll, Romney must run the table on the six remaining swing states or expand the electoral map. Considering how rough the internals look in this morning's Ohio survey, Boston must know that winning the White House now depends on their candidate stealing Michigan, Minnesota or Pennsylvania out of the Obama column next Tuesday. Their play in those three Midwest states now appears to be more out of weakness than strength, though a new survey does put Romney within 3 points in Michigan.
Campaigns look past the polls | <paragraph> This year's polling data gets more confusing by the day. <paragraph> Barack Obama supporters trash Gallup's methodology as biased and skewed. Mitt Romney partisans seem to attack ANY poll that shows their candidate down — especially in Ohio. Like many in the news business, I spent the past few days on the phone with leaders of both campaigns to get a better grasp on how the final stretch will play out. <paragraph> The contrast in the two camps' thinking was striking. <paragraph> All the president's men believe they have built a turnout machine over the past five years like no other in American political history. Team Obama has been on the ground for five years in Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Iowa, New Hampshire and every other swing state that matters. They have reached out and touched more voters personally than Romney, the Republican National Committee and local party leaders combined. And they believe that five-year head start will lead to victory on Election Day. <paragraph> The Romney campaign is now relying more on the intangibles of the political trade. Boston expects to be swept to victory on Election Day because of debate momentum, partisan passions and that evergreen emotion voters always carry with them into the voting booth called  Change.  The great irony for the Romney camp is that their candidate, who has been driven by data and numbers his entire life, now has to rely on the most unpredictable and maddening force of all — human emotion — to carry him over the top and into the White House. <paragraph> Still, neither side dared predict an outcome, and both campaigns are as clueless as to the election's final outcome as you and me. <paragraph> That means the last 10 days are going to be a wild ride for the campaigns, the candidates and the country they both want to run.
Two new polls scream 'advantage Obama' | <paragraph> Two polls released yesterday show President Obama stubbornly clinging to his electoral advantage. TIME Magazine released a new Ohio poll that has Mitt Romney trailing in the Buckeye State by 5 points. Last week's NBC News Wall Street Journal Marist survey also had Romney behind by 5. <paragraph> TIME's poll should rattle the nerves of Romney supporters because the results run contrary to Team Romney's ongoing claim that their internal polls show a dead heat in the Buckeye State. Maybe that's the case among voters planning to go to the polls on election day but it looks like early voters are tilting dramatically in the president's direction. If the TIME poll is accurate, it means Mitt Romney will have to grab most of Ohio's remaining undecided voters if he wants to win this critical battleground state. <paragraph> PPP released a Nevada survey yesterday that also shows President Obama holding a lead in this key swing state that remains outside the margin of error. Like Ohio, Nevada remains stubbornly in the Obama column. While Mitt Romney has made up ground in the three Southern swing states of Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, voters in Ohio, Nevada and Wisconsin seem do not seem inclined to be easily swept into Romney's camp. <paragraph> Despite President Obama's advantage, his top advisors say we will not see the full impact of the final debate for a few more days. But at least for today, President Obama is holding onto his swing state advantage. And you can be sure that advantage will hold steady at least until a next batch of polls are released later today.
A narrow Obama win or a Romney landslide | <paragraph> Mika, Willie and I have spent the past few weeks answering the same question from viewers, family members and friends.  Who's going to win the election??  <paragraph> After the first debate, that question was asked in the form of a plea from Democrats. Before that, Republicans grimly asked for their prognosis, resigned to the fact that the answer would not be satisfying. <paragraph> I spent most of the year telling those who asked that the dynamics of the race suggested a narrow Barack Obama win. But that all changed after the president's Denver debacle. After that meltdown, I am the first to admit I have no idea how this will turn out. <paragraph> But I do know this: Mitt Romney will win the presidency if he wins Ohio. That's because the Republican candidate is nailing down the Southern swing states that he has to win. With Florida, North Carolina and Virginia moving his way, the battle now moves to the Midwest. <paragraph> If Romney's momentum is strong enough to erase the 10-point deficit he once faced in Ohio, expect him to carry other swing states like Nevada and Colorado. <paragraph> That scenario would have been far more plausible had Mr. Romney turned in a stronger performance at last night's debate in Florida. As things stand today, Ohio is still a heavy lift for the GOP candidate and that means President Obama should still be considered a slight favorite to win reelection. <paragraph> But my gut tells me there are two likely scenarios:  1  President Obama will squeak out a narrow Electoral College victory or  2  Mitt Romney will carry Ohio and be swept into office by a comfortable margin. <paragraph> After practicing politics for 20 years, I suppose I would rather be in Mitt Romney's shoes than Barack Obama's. Incumbents who are under 50 percent two weeks out usually go down to defeat. <paragraph> But who knows? Maybe Barack Obama will bend history once again.
Romney's Electoral College gains | <paragraph> Is Mitt Romney surging ahead of Barack Obama in the battleground states that will elect the next president? USA Today says  yes  and insiders in the Democratic Party are growing more concerned by the day that the President's built-in advantage in the Electoral College has all but disappeared. <paragraph> A new USA Today Gallup poll has Romney leading President Obama by 4 percentage points among likely voters in 12 battleground states. The reason? USA Today says women in these swing states are moving Mitt's way. Time Magazine's Mark Halperin is also reporting tonight in an Electoral College update that a top Democratic source is worrying for the first time that Ohio may be slipping out of the Obama column and moving toward the tossup pile. <paragraph> Halperin explains: “This doesn't mean Romney has the upper hand right now. But it is no longer at all  implausible that he could take the three Southern battlegrounds and Ohio. If he does that,  he sure as heck would have the upper hand.  And that leaves at least some Democrats with the shakes.” <paragraph> Just yesterday, a new ABC News Washington Post poll had President Obama surging ahead of Mitt Romney and breaking past the 50 percent mark, so who knows what the next poll brings. But one thing is certain, the tightening race does give us all one more reason to tune into Tuesday night's presidential debate.
Beware of summertime subpoenas | <paragraph> If it's summer, it must be time for a scandal. Or at least summertime in Washington has long seemed a season for faux high-drama, with committee chairmen all looking for their Sam Ervin moment. <paragraph> Here's a reality check: There's a reason Sam Ervin was Sam Ervin; He had Watergate. <paragraph> The latest entrant in the scandal sweepstakes is the  Fast and Furious  showdown, with GOP Chairman Darrell Issa battling Attorney General Eric Holder. For the ideologically uninitiated,  Fast and Furious  was a bungled ATF operation that funneled guns to Mexican cartels. By the time the dust settled, a U.S. agent was dead. <paragraph> Chairman Issa and Republican leaders are right to want answers. They know that an embarrassed White House wants to keep damning facts away from the press during an election year. And now Mr. Issa wants to find Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over those documents. <paragraph> There are real issues about executive power at stake, and even the dead agent's family want President Barack Obama to be more forthcoming about the operation.  But Congressman Issa should beware the political siren song of headlines and cable crawls. Americans care about jobs, and the image of flying subpoenas and internal fighting are more likely to turn off key independent voters than they are to bring Justice to justice. <paragraph> As a surviving member of the GOP Congress who subpoenaed Bill Clinton's White House for the better part of eight years, I know firsthand that what makes for good partisan headlines can also make for bad election-year politics.
39 percent? | <paragraph> It was a startling announcement that got too little attention: Earlier this month the Federal Reserve issued findings showing that the median U.S. household lost nearly 39 percent of its wealth from 2007 to 2010. <paragraph> If you're looking for a missing decimal point--surely it's 3.9 percent, you might think--you're looking in vain. <paragraph> Anyone who cares about America's place in the 21st Century economy should find this 39 percent figure depressing for all the obvious reasons.  But that shocking statistic also makes our task all the more clear: we must grow our way back into confidence and prosperity. And we get to decide whether Obama or Romney has the best chance of achieving that. <paragraph> That's a hell of a debate. But the Fed numbers show that the winner of that battle will have a historic task on his hands come next January.
Swing-state math breaks for Obama | <paragraph> Ronald Reagan's run to the White House was quickened by sluggish economies throughout America's most important political swing states in 1980. Those states' downturns doomed the then-sitting Democratic president. <paragraph> Three decades later, a different swing state dynamic may end up helping the current Democratic president living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. <paragraph> A quick look at the latest labor statistics actually shows surprising strength in America's most vital political swing states. <paragraph> Ohio's unemployment rate has been dropping steadily for a year now, and currently sits at 7.3%. Florida's unemployment rate is now 8.6%, a full two percentage points below where it was just one year ago. And Virginia's unemployment rate remains stubbornly low, as that state's Republican governor lines himself up as a possible VP choice. <paragraph> Add the lift that Barack Obama will surely get from Michigan and other Industrial Midwest states aided by the auto bailout and suddenly this year's swing state math seems to break President Obama's way. <paragraph> Of course, it is only June. And as any good Red Sox fan knows, the games don't really start to count until after Labor Day.
Scott Walker's winning ways | <picture>  <paragraph>  Soon after the 2010 elections, Mika and I had a long dinner with David Axelrod about what went wrong for Democrats. During the dinner, a Republican operative walked over to our table and asked me to get up and visit the next table to meet the man who was just elected governor in Wisconsin. I walked over, met Scott Walker and immediately found myself unimpressed.  <paragraph>  Walker seemed too shy and too uncomfortable in Washington. I thought to myself that this was the kind of guy who gets swept into office during an ideological landslide and then gets booted out when the electorate moves back to the center a few years later. I saw that happen to many of my 1994 classmates. I saw it happen to Democrats who got elected in 2006. And I was pretty sure I would see it happen to Walker.  <paragraph>  Within a few months of his inauguration, I was sure of my prediction. Scott Walker quickly found himself in the middle of a political firestorm by moving too abruptly on union reform. Even though I was ideologically sympathetic to his cause, this looked like one more Republican leader who allowed himself to be painted as a right-wing extremist.  <paragraph>  I invited the governor on  Morning Joe  and immediately asked him if he had made a mistake moving forward too quickly on his agenda. His answer was a stunner.  <paragraph>   Yes, I did.   <paragraph>  Then the governor started calmly explaining how he had failed to listen to enough of his constituents before moving against collective bargaining. This was coming from a leader who had just endured a barrage of nasty personal attacks from political opponents he had just crushed in the Wisconsin legislature. After thanking Scott at the end of what I expected to be a contentious interview, I turned to Mika and said,  Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong about that guy.   <paragraph>  Few politicians were so graceful in victory as Walker and even fewer learned from their mistakes as quickly as he did in 2011. That humility was on full display last night as Walker used his acceptance speech to thank God, lift up his family and praise his Democratic opponent while telling Wisconsin Republicans to work harder on bipartisan compromise. He even used his speech to admit again that he should have listened more before moving on union reform. The governor told his partisan followers that  more unites us than divides us  and that  now is the time to move forward together.   <paragraph>  After watching last night's victory speech, my opinion of the shy politician I met in Washington in 2010 changed again. I decided that Scott Walker just might be that rare type of leader who is able to move an electorate his way by being blessed with the perfect proportions of courage and humility.  <paragraph>  That was a winning formula in Wisconsin last night and could be the way forward for a party that has recently had the habit of unnecessarily provoking persuadable voters. Hopefully, the governor will learn to deal with all of the indignities Washington brings because his party and country may need him as part of a national ticket in the coming years.
The next great depression? |   <paragraph>  If the world slides into a global depression over the next year, consider yourself forewarned by the Wall Street Journal. Yesterday's edition was packed with so many grim headlines that one could be forgiven for believing that we could be seeing cash-filled wheelbarrows by the end of the summer.  <paragraph>  In what could have been called the Black Friday issue, the Journal reported on: - an Asian slowdown brought on by European woes - India's economy sputtering to a nine-year low - a continued economic slowdown in China - weakness coming out of South Korea and Australia - a growing banking crisis in Spain - a deepening of Greece's economic collapse - increased economic problems across Africa - the desperate plea of European bankers for a unified rescue fund   <paragraph>  Yet another WSJ story reported that President Obama was aggressively weighing in on the European debt crisis, urging EU leaders to make tough choices to prevent the kind of crisis that propelled him into the White House four years ago. The Journal wrote of a growing concern in the White House that a similar crisis could be responsible for his defeat four years after the September 15th meltdown.  <paragraph>  Adding to the grimness of Friday's morning edition was a jobs report that landed on Wall Street with a thud at 8:30 a.m.. Yesterday's depressing jobs report was terrible news for the president and the millions of Americans who are still struggling to find a job.  <paragraph>  The economic data released this week was not much better for some of the U.S.'s top employers.  <paragraph>  The screaming headline  Business Braces for Europe's Worst  was splashed across the top of the Journal's Marketplace section. Companies like McDonald's, Carnival and Goodrich are sure to see their earnings hit hard by a sagging European economy.  <paragraph>  That is bad news for U.S. workers and for a president who has five months left to prove that his policies have reversed an economic slide that he inherited in 2008. Chicago's argument keeps getting tougher to make every month, with the backdrop of an economy that seems to be growing weaker by the day.
Feds seek to lock press, public out of Portland bomb trial | <paragraph>  Federal prosecutors have moved to lock the press and public out of testimony by undercover FBI personnel at the upcoming trial of an Oregon man accused of plotting to bomb a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland in 2010.  <paragraph>  In order to keep the identities of the undercover agents secret, prosecutors want to close the courtroom at Mohamed Mohamud’s trial while the agents testify. The press and public could sit in another courtroom and watch a partially-obscured video feed in which the “images” of the undercover FBI employees would not be visible.  <paragraph>  Prosecutors also want to alter the appearance of their key witnesses—a little bit, anyway.  <paragraph>  “The [undercover employees] may testify using a light disguise, such as changing the UCEs’ facial hair, hairstyle, or dress style,” prosecutors wrote in an Oct. 23 motion  posted   <hyperlink> here . “When the UCEs testify, only the Court, essential personnel, the jury, the defendant and his counsel, and the government’s trial team shall be present in the courtroom.”  <paragraph>  Mohamud’s lawyers have objected to the secrecy.  <paragraph>  “The measures sought by the government would convey information or impressions to the jury that undermine the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial based solely on the evidence,  defense attorneys Steve Sady and Steve Wax wrote in their response  posted   <hyperlink> here .  Such restrictions have also historically been disfavored as unfairly prejudicial to the defense, because jurors who witness such precautions are likely to assume that the defendant is especially dangerous and thus guilty.   <paragraph>  “Any disguise that would actually conceal the operatives’ identities would almost certainly obscure their facial expressions. Assessing facial expression is critical to a fact finder’s assessment of a witness’s credibility, and even to counsel’s fine-tuning of the examination of that witness,” the defense added.  <paragraph>  The defense lawyers also noted that, regardless of whether the court authorizes any special measures to protect the FBI employees, their client could easily recognize them. “Mr. Mohamud himself, of course, has long been in a position to identify the operatives by sight, as he spent hours on end in their presence and following their directions,” the defense attorneys added.  <paragraph>  Prosecutors are also seeking to keep the true names of the operatives from the defense on the grounds that their identities are classified. The operatives are involved in ongoing undercover investigations, the government says.  <paragraph>  The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees defendants a public trial. Courts have also interpreted the First Amendment to require that criminal proceedings be open to the public. However, partial closures of trials have been upheld in unusual or exceptional circumstances.  <paragraph>  The secrecy measures the government is seeking are unusual, but have been employed in several federal criminal trials in recent years. Similar measures were used to obscure the identities of Israeli government security personnel who testified against Palestinian activists at terror-finance related trials in Tampa, Chicago and Dallas. Just last month, the Supreme Court declined to take up an appeal stemming from the Dallas trial, which involved leaders of the Holy Land Foundation charity.  <paragraph>  While measures such as trial closures, disguises and the like have been used only rarely in American courtrooms up to this point, the rationale supporting them would appear to apply in numerous cases, since undercover informants are frequently used in drug, gang and organized crime prosecutions.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Court Judge Garr King has yet to rule on the motion. The trial for Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia, is set to get underway Jan. 15.
Foreign Policy mag fights suit by Abbas's son |  <paragraph>  Foreign Policy magazine is asking a federal court to toss out   <hyperlink> a libel suit filed by Yasser Abbas, a son of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, over   <hyperlink> a commentary the international affairs journal published in June suggesting that Yasser Abbas has grown wealthy due to his father’s political position. <paragraph>  In legal papers filed this month in U.S. District Court, Foreign Policy—a division of the Washington Post Co.—argues that Abbas’s lawsuit is part of a pattern of litigation aimed at intimidating his critics.  <paragraph>  Foreign Policy’s attorneys also argue that the lawsuit should be dismissed in accordance with a District of Columbia law passed in 2010 and aimed at ensuring robust debate on issues of public significance.  <paragraph>  “While Abbas’s legal strategy might sometimes be effective in places in the world with lesser protection for freedom of speech and the press than in the United States, it certainly cannot pass muster under the First Amendment – let alone in the District of Columbia, which has enacted legislation to address this precise scenario, which involves a classic Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation,” lawyers Kevin Baine of Williams and Connolly and Nathan Siegel of Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz wrote in the Nov. 5 motion to dismiss  posted   <hyperlink> here .  <paragraph>  So-called anti-SLAPP laws allow for the expedited dismissal of defamation suits when a plaintiff does not have evidence at the outset of a case that he or she is likely to prevail. They’ve been passed in numerous states and jurisdictions to crack down on the practice of companies and individuals filing lawsuits that can drain a target financially even if the suits have little chance of ultimate success on the merits.  <paragraph>  It’s not entirely clear that the D.C. anti-SLAPP law applies in federal court, but the magazine’s lawyers say the weight of legal precedent suggests that it does.  <paragraph>  Foreign Policy also filed a separate motion arguing that Abbas’s suit should be dismissed because the commentary, written by Jonathan Schanzer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies was largely a question-raising exercise that did not make factual assertions, was essentially opinion protected by the First Amendment, and generally didn’t meet the definition of libelous material.  <paragraph>  The case is pending before Judge Emmet Sullivan, who has not yet ruled on the motions.  Yasser Abbas's complaint against Foreign Policy, the Post company and Schanzer, was filed in September and is available   <hyperlink> here courtesy of Courthouse News.   <paragraph>  The Abbas lawsuit evokes a libel case filed against the Washington Post itself three decades ago by William Tavoulareas, the head of Mobil Oil, and his son Peter, over a 1979 news article arguing that Peter had won shipping business from Mobil as a result of his father's position. That case went to trial and resulted in a $2 million verdict against the Post. However, the judge who presided over the trial granted a post-trial motion tossing out the verdict and the suit.  <paragraph>  In 1987—some eight years after the article indispute was published, the D.C. Circuit sitting en banc,  <hyperlink> upheld the decision to toss out the verdict. <paragraph>  Baine, one of the lawyers defending Foreign Policy in the Abbas suit, was part of the team that defended the Washington Post in the marathon Tavoulareas litigation.  <paragraph>  Disclosure: One of the firms representing Foreign Policy, Levine Sullivan, also does legal work for POLITICO .
U of Denver removes, restores Paula Broadwell video | <paragraph>  <video>  <paragraph>  <video> <paragraph>  The University of Denver removed a speech by alleged David Petraeus paramour Paula Broadwell from YouTube earlier Monday but later re-posted it, a spokeswoman for the school confirmed.  <paragraph>   We did remove it for a few hours this morning while we were conducting an internal review.  Sorry, again for the inconvenience,  spokeswoman Kim DeVigil wrote in response to a query from POLITICO. Despite our inquirites, she did not elaborate on who initiated the review or why.  <paragraph>  Despite the re-posting the video on the university's official YouTube account, a number of blog posts relating to it continue to show that  this video has been removed by the user.  That's because the video was re-posted with a different link. <paragraph>  Some recent press reports suggested Broadwell may have shared sensitive or classified information in her Oct. 26 remarks at a D.U. alumni event. However, most or all of what she said about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya was reported earlier that day by Fox News, as we noted   <hyperlink> here.
Broadwell spoke of access to classified info |   <paragraph>  <video>  <paragraph>  Paula Broadwell, the author, military reservist and West Point graduate who reportedly had an extramarital affair with former CIA director David Petraeus, told an audience this summer that she routinely had access to classified information while researching a book on Petraeus's work as the commanding general in Afghanistan.  <paragraph>  During a panel discussion, Broadwell said her background  in the military and her continuing obligations as a major in the Army Reserve made her particularly careful not to disclose sensitive information she was privy to while an  embed  in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011.  <paragraph>   I was entrusted with this opportunity to sit in on high level meetings with General Petraeus. Sitting in on SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility] meetings in the morning, listen to classified chatter of terrorist talk and so forth. And I had that background anyhow, so I knew a lot of that information for my writing, but I knew there was a clear line that I couldn’t cross when I was writing it out,  Broadwell said in   <hyperlink> the July 2012 discussion at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Paula Broadwell in media spotlight   <paragraph>  Broadwell acknowledged that her connection to the military and her role as a writer sometimes caused confusion among military personnel she encountered while working on the book.  <paragraph>   I was embedded with Gen. Petraeus in Afghanistan and it was a little confusing for some of the folks there because I’m also a military reservist with a top secret SCI clearance and then some. So, a lot of my former peers didn’t know how to treat me. Was I journalist Broadwell or was I Major Broadwell?  she recalled.  I had to follow very clear lines of non-disclosure and signed non-disclosure agreements like my colleagues. I felt like I was almost held to a higher level of accountability because I could lose my clearance.   <paragraph>  Broadwell's access to classified information has drawn scrutiny in the wake of reports that investigators found classified records on her computer and that a whistleblower approached House Majority Leader Eric Cantor  R-Va.  recently to express concern that a relationship Petraeus had may have led to classified information being compromised. The discovery of the classified information on Broadwell's computer was   <hyperlink> reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The involvement of Cantor, whose staff said the information was immediately passed on to the FBI, was   <hyperlink> disclosed Saturday by the New York Times.  <paragraph>  Other news reports have also raised questions about Broadwell's access to classified information, including details related to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in September.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Critics question Petraeus's timing   <paragraph>  In a speech last month at the University of Denver, Broadwell said that the CIA at one point was holding prisoners at an annex near the consulate, and that the assault may have been an effort to free those prisoners.  I don't know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually—had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. So, that's still being vetted,  she said, according to a video of the Denver event posted online and first   <hyperlink> reported by the Israeli media outlet Arutz Sheva.  <paragraph>  Later in her remarks, Broadwell, said some of her information had come from a Fox News report.  <hyperlink> Fox said Monday that it's  original  Oct. 26 report did mention three Libyan militia members being turned over by the CIA to Libyan authorities. That detail   <hyperlink> does not appear in the version of the story now posted online, but Fox reporter Jennifer Griffin did include it in at least one report.  <paragraph>   We're also told, those at the CIA annex took into custody three Libyan attackers and were forced to hand them over to the Libyan February 17th forces that came to help at the annex approximately 4:00 in the morning. They handed these three Libyans over. It is not clear from U.S. officials what happened to the libyans and whether those Libyan attackers were in fact released in in the end by the Libyans,  Griffin reported.  <paragraph>  The CIA has denied holding any prisoners at Benghazi and has vigorously disputed other aspects of Griffin's report, but it's not clear Broadwell said anything in Denver that was not previously reported by Fox.  Griffin first issued her report at about 11 A.M. Eastern Time that day. Broadwell, per  <hyperlink> a D.U. schedule, spoke after 7 P.M. Mountain Time.   <paragraph>  At the Aspen conference in July, panel moderator Clark Bell of the McCormick Foundation said  certain elements  of Broadwell's book,  All In: The Education of David Petraeus,  underwent a pre-publication security review to scrub it of classified information.  <paragraph>  Journalists embedded with the military often have access to some classified information. The practice falls into a kind of gray area. Many embed assignments would be hard to undertake without knowing some sensitive information about tactics and upcoming operations. But, journalists don't have security clearances and are not subject to background investigations.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: 10 fast facts about Gen. Petraeus   <paragraph>  In any event, Broadwell said she did not consider herself a journalist. In her remarks to the security professionals, journalists and government contractors at the Aspen event, she repeatedly used language that stressed how familiar she was with secret matters. During her relatively brief comments, she spoke of working for a Joint Terrorism Task Force, of her top secret clearance  and then some,  and of familiarity with  Five Eyes  efforts—lingo for U.S. Government intelligence information shared only with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.  <paragraph>  While Broadwell stressed the access she had, she also said she was especially vigilant to not disclose any classified information because it would have been a breach of trust between her and Petraeus, whom she described as a mentor. <paragraph>   Sometimes, obviously, the government just cant disclose sources and methods and so forth,  she said.  That was just reinforced when I had access to everything, it was my responsibility not to leak it—not to violate my mentor, if you will. I was writing about a very close mentor.   <paragraph>  UPDATE  Monday, 1:45 P.M. : An earlier version of this post said Fox News did not appear to have reported that prisoners were taken by the CIA in Benghazi. Fox says it did report something similar to that on Oct. 26.  <paragraph>  UPDATE  Monday, 2:02 P.M.  We've located the original Fox quote and posted it above.
Manning offers guilty pleas in WikiLeaks case |  <paragraph>  Army Private Bradley Manning is offering to plead guilty to some charges in the court martial he is facing for allegedly providing thousands of diplomatic cables, military reports and videos to WikiLeaks.  <paragraph>  Manning made the offer through his attorney, David Coombs, at a preliminary hearing Wednesday at Fort Meade, Md.  Manning faces a total of 34 charges, including aiding the enemy, violating the Espionage Act by providing classified information to an unauthorized party, and violating Army regulations and orders.  <paragraph>  Coombs said in   <hyperlink> a blog post Wednesday night that Manning is willing to admit that the facts support some of the charges, including in some cases lesser offenses incorporated in more serious charges brought against the Army intelligence analyst. However, there is no plea deal or agreement with the government at this time.  <paragraph>  Experts said Manning's move may be an attempt to reinforce the defense's arguments that the case is  overcharged,  meaning the charges are more serious than befits what the soldier actually did or is alleged to have done. However, if prosecutors want to proceed with the full case as charged, there is nothing about Manning's offer that forces them not to.  <paragraph>   PFC Manning has offered to plead guilty to various offenses through a process known as 'pleading by exceptions and substitutions.' To clarify, PFC Manning is not pleading guilty to the specifications as charged by the Government,  Coombs wrote.  Rather, PFC Manning is attempting to accept responsibility for offenses that are encapsulated within, or are a subset of, the charged offenses.  The Court will consider whether this is a permissible plea.   <paragraph>  Manning has also elected not to be tried by a panel of military officers, but by a military judge sitting alone.  <paragraph>  On the scene reports from Wednesday's hearing are available from   <hyperlink> Kevin Gosztola at Firedoglake,  <hyperlink> Adam Klasfeld of Courthouse News and   <hyperlink> blogger ad hoc transcriptionist Alexa O'Brien.
Cuomo: Storm victims can vote anywhere in New York |  <paragraph>  Gov. Andrew Cuomo  D-N.Y.  announced Monday that New York residents displaced by Hurricane Sandy can cast ballots anywhere in the state.  <paragraph>   We want everyone to vote. Just because people are displaced doesn't mean they should be disenfranchised,  Cuomo said at a news conference, according to the Asssociated Press.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> On Twitter, Cuomo indicated that permission to vote  by affidavit  had been granted to residents of Rockland and Westchester counties, Long Island and New York City.  <paragraph>  Civil rights and voting rights groups had urged Cuomo to issue such an order, much as N.J. Gov. Chris Christie's administration did on Saturday.  <paragraph>  Cuomo said all voters will be able to cast ballots for president and U.S. Senate, but only those voters who go to a precinct in their home district will be able to vote for state Senate, assembly and local offices.  <paragraph>   You can't vote for what we call down-ballot individuals,  Cuomo said.  Your vote will not be eligible. 
Judge sets hearing in Ohio provisional-votes fight |  <paragraph>  A federal judge has set a hearing for Wednesday morning—the morning after Election Day—to hear arguments about the rules for counting provisional ballots in Ohio.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Court Judge Algenon Marbley set the 11 A.M. Wednesday session in Columbus via an order issued Monday afternoon and posted   <hyperlink> here.  <paragraph>  Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted issued a directive Friday that requires voters to complete the identification section on provisional ballots, rather than pollworkers. A variety of unions, a homeless-aid group and the Ohio Democratic Party say having voters fill that out themselves could lead to inaccuracies or errors. The labor groups and Democrats have asked Marbley to order the state to count provisional ballots even if that identification information is incomplete.  <paragraph>   Since this suit bears on Ohio’s conduct of the November 6, 2012 election, it is appropriate to deviate from the Local Rules in order to expedite the briefing schedule and timely resolve the question. The timing is particularly sensitive given the need for Defendant Husted and the State of Ohio to issue instructions to election officials in conformity with this Court’s decision prior to the counting of provisional ballots,  Marbley wrote in Monday's order.  <paragraph>  Marbley gave Ohio authorities until the end of the day Tuesday to file any written opposition to the plaintiffs' demand.  <paragraph>  The judge appears to view the matter as not of such urgency as to require action before Election Day because the relief the plaintiffs' are seeking is not to change Husted's order to pollworkers regarding who fills out the ID information, but rather the question of which ballots will ultimately be counted.  <paragraph>  Under Ohio law, the provisional ballots cannot be officially tabulated before Nov. 17th.
Lawsuit filed over Florida early voting waits |  <paragraph>  The Florida Democratic Party filed a federal lawsuit early Sunday over the extended delays some south   <hyperlink> Florida voters faced during the last official day of early voting on Saturday, when some who turned out to vote waited as long as six hours to cast their ballots.  A copy of the complaint is posted   <hyperlink> here.   <paragraph>  However, it's not clear what more can be done about the situation at this late date and the three counties the Democrats sued seem to be offering the only specific relief sought in the suit—allowing voters to vote in person at each county's central elections office through Tuesday. <paragraph>  Miami-Dade County election officials announced that they would allow in-person absentee voting on Sunday afternoon from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M. It's something of an end-run around the Florida legislature's effort to reduce early voting days to eight from a maximum of 14 previously. Democrats have complained about the changes, calling them a Republican effort to disenfranchise voters, especially attendees of black churches who had bussed parishoners to the polls on the Sunday before Election Day. Defenders of the changes said the 14 days of early voting were too costly and distracting for election organizers.  <paragraph>  However, the Miami-Dade office closed its doors around 2 P.M., saying the staff and equipment were overwhelmed by demand,  <hyperlink> the Miami Herald reported. The office reopened later in the afternoon, but the closure angered about 180 potential voters who were locked out, the newspaper said. The Herald later reported that the interruption was due in part to objections from Miami Mayor Carlos Gimenez, who said he'd not been consulted about the change.  <paragraph>  Florida has fairly liberal absentee ballot rules, allowing absentee ballots to be issued to anyone who says he or she can't make it to the polls on Election Day. So, in-person absentee voting is more or less the same as early voting. However, early voting in Florida usually takes place at numerous sites across a county, while in-person absentee is conducted at permanent election offices and sometimes satellite locations.  <paragraph>   The Elections Department took on this effort to continue serving our voters on the final Sunday before Election Day. While state law does not permit Early Voting today, we do have the authority to provide and accept absentee ballots,  Miami-Dade Deputy Supervisor of Elections Christina White told POLITICO via e-mail. Dade County submitted   <hyperlink> this response to the federal lawsuit, calling it moot with respect to their county.  <paragraph>  Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher told POLITICO Sunday afternoon that her office was also allowing in-person voting after experiencing huge demand for the early voting session Saturday.  <paragraph>   I was here when we were letting our last voter in at 2:30 in the morning,  Bucher said.  This morning at 7:30 A.M., we had people waiting so we decided to let them vote in-person, absenteee. We have discretion under Florida law. So we opened up at 9:30 A.M. There's a line wrapped around the building and we're letting them vote.   <paragraph>  Bucher said anyone who's in line at her office by 5 P.M. Sunday will be permitted to vote.  <paragraph>  Broward County was also allowing some in-person absentee voting Sunday, but voters who'd made appointments were being given priority,  <hyperlink> the Herald said.  <paragraph>  All three counties also plan to allow in-person absentee voting on Monday and Tuesday.  <paragraph>   With unprecedented turnout in South Florida, it is still our hope that the court will extend the early voting hours so that every eligible voter has a chance to vote,  Florida Democratic Party executive director Scott Arceneaux said in a statement.  <paragraph>  Voters in Orange County, which includes and surrounds Orlando, will also get another chance at early voting Sunday after a suspicious package closed a polling site in Winter Park, Fla. for several hours Saturday. A local judge ordered that polling place to be open again Sunday.  <paragraph>  UPDATE  Sunday, 4:00 P.M. : This post has been updated with comments from Bucher and with the Herald's reports of an interruption to voting at the Miami-Dade election headquarters.  <paragraph>  UPDATE 2  Sunday, 10:17 P.M. : This post has been updated with the Herald's report on Gimenez's role in Sunday's events.
Obama appeals to set rules for Guantanamo lawyers |  <paragraph>  The Obama Administration filed a series of appeals Friday night, seeking to overturn a federal judge's order that blocked the military from unilaterally establishing rules for lawyers who represent prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth   <hyperlink> ruled in September that lawyers who helped detainees bring habeas corpus petitions seeking release from Gitmo could continue to visit and communicate with their clients under the rules judges set. Lamberth rejected the Obama Administration's effort to cast those rules aside once the habeas cases or military commission cases and any related appeals were complete.  <paragraph>  In a blistering opinion, Lamberth noted that all the prisoners had a continuing right of access to the courts and he said the administration's move amounted to  an illegitimate exercise of Executive power.  The indictment was a politically pointed one in light of the harsh criticism candidate Barack Obama leveled at President George W. Bush's administration over his assertion of unfettered executive power to prosecute the global war on terror.  <paragraph>  An administration official told POLITICO early Saturday that Friday's filings were made in order to keep open the option of an appeal and that no final decision has been made about whether to see an appeal through. <paragraph>   The government filed a notice of appeal...to preserve its options in this matter. The consideration of an appeal requires appropriate and thorough deliberation and that process is ongoing,  the official said.  <paragraph>  Nevertheless, for now the dispute heads to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  <paragraph>  UPDATE  Saturday, 10:27 A.M. : This post has been updated with comment from an administration official.
Romney dusts off Jobs Council attack |  <paragraph>  GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney went after President Barack Obama on Friday for long-term neglect of his jobs council, dusting off an attack Romney mounted aggressively in July but later largely dropped from his campaign rhetoric.  <paragraph>  Obama  put together a jobs council. These were people he picked from industries around the country. He brought them in to give him advice as to how to create jobs. Do you know how long it’s been since he met with the jobs council? Nine months! Can you imagine that? Nine months!  Romney said during a stop at a mining equipment factory in Etna, Ohio.  Let me tell you: well, first of all, I like business and I’m going to have a lot of people offering advice but I know a good deal about it myself to begin with. And that’ll help being president.”  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> POLITICO reported in July that the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness had not held an official meeting in six months and had not met with Obama during that time. Following the report, both Romney and the Republican Party   <hyperlink> unleashed a fusillade of attacks on Obama, arguing that his apparent neglect of the panel was symbolic of his failure to craft policies to spur job creation.  <paragraph>  However, Romney hasn't said much, if anything, about the Jobs Council since. It was not mentioned in any of his three debates with Obama. The GOP candidate may have dialed back the criticism because some who served on the panel are Republicans or conservatives and an attack on Obama for not meeting with the panel is hard to distinguish with an attack on the panel itself for failing to meet.  One prominent Jobs Council member, Intel CEO Paul Otellini, endorsed Romney earlier this week.   <paragraph>  A White House spokesman suggested in July that Obama had been too busy to meet with the panel in recent months, saying the president had  a lot on his plate.  However, sources familiar with the council said an in-person meeting was likely being avoided because the business leaders on the panel felt awkward appearing with Obama in the midst of a presidential election. Rifts had also developed between the CEOs and the few labor leaders in the group.  <paragraph>  In   <hyperlink> a follow-up story in August, POLITICO noted that the council has held monthly, private telephone calls to discuss its recommendations with Obama Administration officials—a practice which disturbs transparency advocates. The last event of any kind   <hyperlink> noted on the Council's website was in June.  <paragraph>  White House officials say the panel's recommendations have been in large part adopted by the administration, though some require action by Congress. However, Romney is correct that the last official council meeting was more than nine months ago, on Jan. 17, 2012.  <paragraph>  The Obama campaign did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Romney's renewed critique. —James Hohmann contributed to this post.
Harry Malkin: From Pit to Paintbrush | <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CASTLEFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE—The two elderly women dressed in their Sunday best talked about the “human chain” as if they had seen it yesterday, though it was decades ago. It came about after a man had gotten stuck in a tiny space in one of the underground coal mines that used to be the social and economic foundation of these communities. Eileen Sparks’s father-in-law was among the five rescuers who formed the human chain and lowered themselves into the space, finally pulling the man free at the end of a three-day rescue. <PARAGRAPH> “He came out just like a cork!” Sparks recalls. “And they weren’t paid for those three days, because the mine where the rescue was said ‘You’re not on our books,’ and the mine where they worked said ‘Well you weren’t working here.’ ” <PARAGRAPH> These kinds of memories are still very much alive in British coalfield communities like this, even though almost all of the mines closed two to three decades ago, after a bitter year-long miners strike spurred by then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s move to break the once-powerful union. Sparks says she remembers the “pit strike” well—she lived in the nearby “terraced houses,” as the densely-packed miners’ homes were known, and “we didn’t get much sleep, the police were always out making so much noise.” <PARAGRAPH> The two women were admiring a monument by local coal miner turned artist Harry Malkin. This monument is on the site of a former coal mine, Allerton Bywater, though if it weren’t for the monument you would never know it, as it is currently occupied by a modern, bright housing development called Horizons Millennium Village. <PARAGRAPH> Malkin’s piece features two coal tubs overflowing with bright flowers emblazoned with the names of the 87 miners who were killed here, as well as those who were laid off when the pit closed in 1992. Behind the tubs is a carved brick replica of the “pit cage” that would lower miners into the depths of the earth, a rectangular box with chains ascending into the sky. Bas-relief images on the cage show mining technology and the National Union of Mineworkers on the march. At night, the monument is bathed in gentle floodlights, luminous. The base is crowded with wreaths of flowers and handwritten heartfelt notes, placed here after a brass band led thousands on a parade and unveiling ceremony the previous week where locals recited the names of the dead. <PARAGRAPH> Like many in this region, Malkin started mining when he was 15, “school-leaving age” as it was known, and spent two decades working underground until the Fryston mine closed shortly after the 1984-1985 strike. For much of his career, Malkin worked on the coal face, often laying in seams less than three feet tall to assemble or repair machinery. <PARAGRAPH> “Looking back now  the mines closing  was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Malkin says. “Mining broke a lot of people.” <PARAGRAPH> While injury and death statistics have dropped drastically as technology has advanced, Malkin doesn’t necessarily see “modern mining” as any safer than the old days. “Now it will just kill you slower,” he said, noting that he knows “blokes who at 35 could hardly breathe” from pneumoconiosis or black lung disease from the thick chocking dust made by the machines. “It’s crazy that blokes fight for jobs like that.” <PARAGRAPH> As a kid, Malkin was always drawing, and after the mine closed, he had a few works in local exhibitions, sold them, “and saw there’s some money in this, I’ll give it a try.” There weren’t many other jobs available. After the strike, he applied at a local coal-fired power plant, “just for a laugh, as after being on strike for a year who is going to hire you!” <PARAGRAPH> Malkin ended up with a studio overlooking the Glass Houghton coal mine, and watched its transformation over the years. “It was amazing, something you never could have imagined. I thought I would finish  mining  at Fryston and die there like many more did,” he said. <PARAGRAPH> Malkin has exhibited throughout England and Wales and has some of his works in other countries, including Russia and Switzerland. He remembers one of his biggest shows on the South Bank, London, just opposite the house of Parliament where “not a bugger there was a miner. One city gent bought five pieces to give his daughter, who spent money like water, to show her what real working people do.” <PARAGRAPH> Malkin vastly prefers the life of an artist to that of a miner. But mining permeates almost all of his works: dusky drawings and paintings of miners hard at work and other monuments and sculptures celebrating the mining industry and heritage of Yorkshire. In a marshy field not far away rises a graceful, whimsical steel fish, which Malkin made from tub wheels, girders and other metalwork used in mines. It is part of the Yorkshire Art Circus' “Walking on Cold Coal” project that commemorates another now-disappeared mine. <PARAGRAPH> The Yorkshire Art Circus and founder Brian Lewis were key to launching Malkin’s career. Lewis is a poet, teacher and painter who during the mine closures, worked with coalfield residents to help them write a series of books—published and distributed at breakneck speed before the internet made that common—spreading information about the pit closures and describing the human impact. <PARAGRAPH> Another of Malkin’s works commemorates the Athersley pit disaster of 1936, with an eight-foot-high sculpture made from local bricks showing miners looking for survivors after an explosion that killed 59. He also commemorates soldiers killed in Afghanistan and the once-thriving pottery industry in Castleford, the hometown of both Malkin and sculptor Henry Moore, also the son of a coal miner. <PARAGRAPH> Gallery owner Greg McGee was quoted during a 2011 Malkin show, describing his deep understanding of the aesthetics of mining: “Cheeks and eye sockets are ink black, shoulders are slick crescents, and amidst the trembling chiaroscuro the figures quicken and bristle in their brutal work. Their poise and movements are perfectly calibrated with the instinct and knowledge hewn from many decades’ worth of witnessing and working more than one mile deep underground.” <PARAGRAPH> Malkin shares the view of many former miners that “after the mining union went, the unions have no real power anymore”—the strike and destruction of British coal mining “broke the spirit of the working class.” But unlike other former miners who think Thatcher destroyed a vibrant industry, Malkin believes the mines would have closed eventually anyway, even under a Labour government. He laments that England now gets most of the coal for its power plants and industry from afar—South Africa, Colombia, Russia, even the United States. <PARAGRAPH> Though in places like Castleford the memories of the coal mining days are still very present and monuments like Malkin’s dot the landscape, he is afraid that as the generations pass the legacy will fade away. He notes decreased government funding for the National Coal Mining Museum and the smaller museums and commemorative projects throughout the area. Meanwhile, almost all of the old mining sites have been transformed into new developments like the Horizons residential project. <PARAGRAPH> “Not only do they destroy the industry but try to wipe away all traces of it,” says Malkin. “We’ve got all these museums for the late and great but not museums for the little people. In two or three generations, we might be forgotten completely.”
Chicago Passes Austerity Budget with Little Debate  But More Than Usual  | <PARAGRAPH> On Thursday the Chicago City Council passed Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s proposed 2013 budget, which—although it doesn’t include widespread layoffs and service cuts like last year’s—continues the trend of shrinking the city's government. Union analysts and other critics fear a harsh impact on residents who depend on public agencies for services and jobs. <PARAGRAPH> There was never any doubt the budget would pass: Chicago’s city council has long been known as a rubber-stamp body. The vote was 46-3 with one city councilman absent. What was notable was that three councilmen did vote against the budget and one, Robert Fioretti, spoke in strident terms about how cuts and privatization could hurt regular people. Last year’s budget passed unanimously despite deep job cuts, the closure of six union-staffed mental-health clinics, the privatization of primary-care clinics and other public-service cuts.  <PARAGRAPH> “We may not be generating the headlines of the parking meters,” Fioretti said, referring to the debacle in which former Mayor Richard M. Daley leased the city’s meters to a private company,  but we are eliminating middle-class jobs. For what result? What do we say to our constituents who are sold out, to the dedicated employees of mental health centers, to the police officers who are not seeing vacancies filled? ... This helps the city in the long run how?” <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Fioretti was one of a handful of city councilmen in the Progressive Caucus who hosted three evening community budget hearings for citizens to voice concerns, since the mayor broke with tradition in declining to hold any official evening community hearings. <PARAGRAPH> Fioretti concluded by saying he is confident the city can tackle its budget gap but the “lack of transparency and lack of public input gives me great pause.  <PARAGRAPH> Pressure to be ‘all in’ <PARAGRAPH> The other councilmen seemed alarmed by Fioretti's dissent, or perhaps by rumors that up five members of the council were considering a  no  vote. Pushing for unanimity, the majority of the council went to great lengths to praise the budget and the mayor. <PARAGRAPH> “If last time was tough and we were all in, I’m at a little bit of a loss to find out why we aren’t all in today,” said Councilman Patrick O’Connor, who used the phrase “all in” several more times.  <PARAGRAPH> “I would like to see today that unanimity ring through this chamber again to demonstrate that the mayor and members of city council are acting together as one,  said Ed Burke, arguably the council’s most powerful member. It is widely believed that Burke tried to prevent Emanuel from running for mayor in 2011, but he stressed his loyalty to the mayor's budget. He went on to rave about the heroism of local firefighters, seeming to mean that councilmen who opposed the budget were betraying firefighters—an odd implication given that the firefighters union has fought the Emanuel administration over cuts. <PARAGRAPH> Most of the councilmen who heaped praise upon the budget avoided mentioning the hot-button issues of clinic closures, lost jobs and privatization, which were the main concerns aired at the three community hearings and the one barely-publicized official public budget hearing. Instead, the councilmen focused on smaller issues, with many lauding city plans to ratchet up tree trimming—a service Councilman Leslie Hairston said is necessary because overgrown trees block street lights and create “a breeding ground for people to have their purses stolen.  <PARAGRAPH> Numerous councilmen praised the “transparency” of the Emanuel administration and the budget process. This must have been frustrating for the hundreds of citizens who attended the various hearings only to have their concerns almost completely ignored on the day of the vote. Progressive Caucus member Toni Foulkes offered only praise for the budget, though she was at the alternative community hearings and heard hours of testimony about the closing of mental health clinics, among other issues. She did launch into a long rumination on the idea that mental health is a problem, noting that people cannot necessarily recognize the “face of mental illness” in their midst. At no point did she mention mental health clinics. <PARAGRAPH> While Councilman Howard B. Brookins allowed that he had received complaints from 34 water department call-center employees who lost their jobs due to privatization, he praised the mayor’s office for working with them to find other city jobs.  These efforts have not yet borne fruit.  <PARAGRAPH> Shirking responsibility <PARAGRAPH> Union analysts have pointed out that layoffs and cuts which are not immediately obvious may be embedded in the 2013 budget.  The voluminous document includes significantly increased funds for private contracting in the public health and family services departments, indicating privatization is likely in the works. It also includes many references to “efficiency,” a common rationale for job cuts and outsourcing. <PARAGRAPH> AFSCME, which represents Chicago librarians, clinic staff and other public workers, alleges that the city has repeatedly violated the constraints on privatization spelled out in its contract with the union. AFSCME’s contract gives the union the right to “bid” against private contractors when the city is considering privatizing a service. But the union alleges the city has turned services over to private contractors even when AFSCME could do the work more cheaply. For example, the union says the city hired a Japanese firm to take over the water department call center even though the union said city workers could do the job for $800,000 less. <PARAGRAPH> AFSCME says the city has also violated its contract by announcing and moving forward with privatization before notifying the union. For example, Emanuel announced the plan to privatize primary care clinics for a potential savings of $10 million before the union had been consulted.  <PARAGRAPH> Privatization has also made it much harder for unions, consumer groups and others to monitor the quality and equity of city services, the union says. Based on anecdotal reports, advocates doubt that all of the patients who used to depend on public primary-care clinics have been able to get care at the privatized clinics – a concern brought up in the community budget hearings. But it is nearly impossible to find out, since the Freedom of Information Act doesn’t cover private contractors. <PARAGRAPH> A leash on privatization <PARAGRAPH> Nearly all spectators and reporters left the chambers after the budget vote, missing the introduction of a privatization-oversight ordinance that could potentially be very significant for Chicago public employees and taxpayers. <PARAGRAPH> Thirty-two out of the council’s 50 councilmen co-sponsored the Privatization Accountability and Transparency Ordinance, which mandates that before privatizing any service, the city must study its cost-effectiveness. This might seem an obvious idea, but currently the city can and does wait to run such studies until after a contract is awarded. The study must also prove that the economic benefits of privatization outweigh the public benefits of city-run services. <PARAGRAPH> The ordinance mandates that the city work with public employees and union leaders to address quality-of-service issues before turning to a private contractor. This is an important provision to many union leaders, since it is widely believed that city governments allow public services to deteriorate intentionally or through neglect and then use the poor service as a reason to turn it over to the private sector. The ordinance also requires at least one public city council committee hearing be held on service-privatization plans, as it is for asset-privatization plans. <PARAGRAPH> In support of the ordinance, the Chicago Federation of Labor and AFSCME Council 31 issued a statement citing concerns over past privatization deals, including Daley’s parking meter leasing and Emanuel's health clinic privatization. “Any time the city considers taking jobs away from residents and outsourcing them to private companies, it owes those workers a fair chance to keep their jobs,” said CFL president Jorge Ramirez in a statement. <PARAGRAPH> The ordinance was introduced by South Side councilman Roderick T. Sawyer, and needs to pass a committee and then the full council to become city policy. <PARAGRAPH> “I don’t believe there are no good privatization deals,” said a statement by Sawyer, who praised and voted for the 2013 budget. “I just think we should be clear about which deals are in the best interest of the city and which are not. I have a concern about touting monetary savings if we haven’t thought about the people that will lose a job, the families that could lose a home and the local businesses that could lose a loyal customer.”
Airports Go Green … And, Labor Leaders Fear, Bust Unions | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Outside the Westin River North hotel in downtown Chicago on Nov. 5, about 20 men and women in winter clothes stood quietly facing the entrance, handing out fliers. They read, “Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Stop Eliminating GOOD JOBS” and implored people to call the mayor and “tell him to keep our airport CLEAN & SAFE, and our families STRONG.” <PARAGRAPH> Inside the hotel, Emanuel was presiding over the fifth annual Airports Going Green conference, where airport and airline executives from around the world were discussing the latest in sustainable airport management, including aviation biofuel development, electric vehicles, recycled asphalt, community volunteer days and LED flight information screens. Emanuel told the crowd that investment in energy efficiency and sustainability at airports like Chicago’s O’Hare and Midway makes sense because it “creates jobs.”  <PARAGRAPH> But the flierers outside the hotel represented more than 300 janitors who fear they will lose their jobs at O’Hare International Airport. The previous week, the city signed a contract with a new subcontractor to replace Scrub, which currently employs the airport janitors. United Maintenance Company, which won the contract, reportedly submitted a bid to the city’s aviation department promising to do the work for $11 million less than Scrub, a difference of about 10 percent. United Maintenance is not required to hire the people who worked for Scrub, and if they do it will likely be at lower wages, weaker benefits and without union representation. <PARAGRAPH> Tom Balanoff, president of SEIU Local 1  which represents all 330 of the janitors at O'Hare , believes the new contractor will try to thwart any efforts by the janitors to unionize. He tells Working In These Times that United Maintenance head Roger Simon specifically told him they would not recognize SEIU Local 1 and that Simon indicated starting wages will be $12 an hour, considerably lower than the $15 an hour many are making with Scrub. <PARAGRAPH> SEIU Local 1 finds the cost-cutting in the janitorial contracts especially frustrating because the city does not save any money. The janitorial funds don’t come out of the general city budget, but rather are covered through fees paid by airlines. Moreover, the city rejected bids by several union contractors who like Scrub also recognize SEIU Local 1 and would pay union wages.  They are covered by the union's master contract.  <PARAGRAPH> “This is simply a way to bust the union,” Balanoff said. “And it’s the wrong direction to be going in.” <PARAGRAPH> SEIU Local 1 represents janitors, window washers, security guards and others who work for private contractors in city buildings. While the airport janitorial jobs have been privatized for a number of years, Balanoff would like to see them made public again—with workers directly hired by the city—even though that would mean Local 1 losing members to SEIU Local 73, which represents city employees. <PARAGRAPH> The janitors outside weren’t the only labor representatives at the Airports Going Green conference. Later that afternoon, panelists discussed greening airport concessions, such as restaurants and snack shops. Steve Dietz, business manager of Food Donation Connection, spoke about his company's work facilitating donations of unsold food to hunger relief agencies. Dietz noted that concessions workers are big boosters of the program and take home unsold food themselves. <PARAGRAPH> During the Q&A, Don Lydon, an analyst for UNITE HERE Local 1 stood and said, ”Workers will be at the forefront of implementing these sustainable business practices … so do you think we need to make these sustainable jobs with living wages, so they’re not relying on food donations?” <PARAGRAPH> Dietz seemed caught off guard and answered, “We don’t control what people pay … we only have 40 people in our company … I would agree with that … but unfortunately I don’t know … Who controls all that?” <PARAGRAPH> It’s true Dietz and his organization have no power over what huge companies running airport concessions pay their workers; however, the city aviation department and the city council do, through the contracts with concessionaires. <PARAGRAPH> UNITE HERE Local 1 represents about 1,300 concessions workers at O’Hare and Midway. The union has long been pushing the city council to close a loophole exempting airport concessions from the city’s living wage policy, which mandates private contractors working for the city pay their workers the city living wage of $11.53 an hour.  Meanwhile, critics including Balanoff argue that $11.53 isn’t truly a living wage in Chicago.  <PARAGRAPH> Just two weeks before the conference, about 1,200 workers at O'Hare concessionaire HMS Host signed a union contract with the company that would increase their wages and benefits significantly, to above the living wage. But at the same time they celebrated this victory, they worried they would lose their jobs—or at least their newfound raises—in coming months. HMS Host’s contract with the city expired over the summer, and city officials have said they will be accepting new bids over the winter. Like the janitors, the concessions workers could lose their jobs or be rehired at lower wages if the city chooses a non-union contractor. <PARAGRAPH> In theory, either the city council or the aviation department—which decides which bids to recommend to the council—could require that bidders have fair labor practices. UNITE HERE has for some time been pushing the city council to adopt an ordinance called Stable Jobs, Stable Airports, which would mandate any new company rehire existing workers for at least a 90 day trial period and ensure “labor peace,” giving workers a fair chance to organize with a union. In October, hundreds of Chicagoans including prominent pastors and aldermen had joined airport concessions workers at the Chicago Temple downtown, calling for the ordinance’s passage and the renewal of HMS Host’s contract. <PARAGRAPH> “It’s the airport workers who make the sustainable food,” UNITE HERE organizer Chris Williams tells Working In These Times. Williams works for a sushi shop at O’Hare airport, and he said employees like himself take pride in making quality, healthy food and participating in recycling and other sustainability programs. “Like Rahm Emanuel said here, going green and creating jobs goes hand-in-hand. These things are not diametrically opposed. The employees are pushing for the same things as the city, they should recognize that.”
Activists Arrested Confronting Dick Durbin About ‘Fiscal Cliff’. Chicagoans dressed as Robin Hood staged civil disobedience at the Majority Whip’s office. | <PARAGRAPH> With hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to desperately needed federal safety-net programs looming and the future of Bush-era tax cuts to the rich up in the air, Chicago activists brought their case to U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin  D-Ill.  last week. <PARAGRAPH> In two days of action on Thursday and Friday, a coalition of Chicago grassroots and faith-based groups called Make Wall Street Pay Illinois demanded that Durbin use his leverage as Senate Majority Whip to protect crucial public services and programs such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare from the massive cuts ahead. <PARAGRAPH> Under the measure known as sequestration, the federal budget will be automatically slashed by $1.2 trillion in January 2013 if Congress doesn’t take action to delay the cuts or find other ways to drastically decrease spending. In the lame-duck session this week, Congress is trying to hash out a “Grand Deal” that would avoid sequestration, but the deal could itself entail significant cuts for safety-net programs. One option to help avoid cuts would be a tax increase; Senators are haggling over whether to restore taxes on the rich to the Clinton-era rate of 39.6 percent, or leave them at the 35 percent rate created by Bush’s tax cuts. <PARAGRAPH> Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke dubbed the potential impacts a looming “fiscal cliff,” and economists say it could mean the loss of more than two million jobs. <PARAGRAPH> On Friday, November 9, eight people entered Durbin’s office in the federal building in Chicago, asked for a meeting with the Senator, and within 15 minutes were arrested. Another six activists from different faith-based and community groups entered the office, but left when faced with a choice between leaving quietly and being arrested. About an hour later, 11 more activists who were holding a banner inside the building’s ground floor lobby were arrested, dragged or carried by officers to a detention center within the building after going limp in protest. <PARAGRAPH> “This says something about who the senator will meet with and when,” said Beth Lanford, chair of the group Northside POWER, who was in Durbin’s office but was not among those arrested. “[His staff was] not even willing to call him on the phone, they didn’t even want to know what we were there for. Meanwhile they’re probably meeting behind closed doors right now, or have been”–about a deal that would include massive cuts. <PARAGRAPH> Serving the rich or protecting the poor? <PARAGRAPH> The protesters challenged Durbin to live up to his reputation as an advocate of the people by blocking cuts to public spending and by raising revenue through higher taxes on the rich and a “Robin Hood Tax” on financial transactions. <PARAGRAPH> In the lobby of the federal building and pressed against the windows outside, several hundred protesters chanted “We are the 99%” and “People over profits.” Members of National Nurses United wore peaked green “Robin Hood “ hats with red arrows, an allusion to HR 6411, proposed by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison  D-MN , a version of the Financial Transaction Tax which has been embraced by a number of debt-ridden European countries including Greece and Spain. Jan Rodolfo, a registered nurse and union employee, noted that nurses in the county health system have already seen increasing numbers of needy patients in severe economic distress, a situation that will only get worse if the government slashes spending on services and entitlement programs. <PARAGRAPH> “We see cancer patients burst into tears because they haven’t eaten in three days,” Rodolfo said. “We see all kinds of stress-related ailments, high blood pressure, ulcers. The suicide rate is sky-high. The county [health system] is where people go when they fall through the cracks, and it’s only going to get worse.” <PARAGRAPH> The previous morning, Nov. 8, protesters visited Durbin’s office and smashed two “golden calves”—actually piñatas—filled with gold coins. “In the Hebrew Bible, Aaron made a golden calf for the Israelites to worship after they grew disenchanted waiting 40 days and nights for Moses to receive God’s commandments,” read a statement from the coalition. “This symbolizes that when we destroy our worship of the idols of excessive wealth and greed, we can find the resources to invest in the common good and build a future of shared prosperity.” <PARAGRAPH> Taking a risk <PARAGRAPH> Before heading to Durbin’s office for the Friday sit-in, members of groups including Northside POWER, Occupy, SOUL  Southsiders Organized for Unity and Liberation  and Illinois Indiana Regional Organizing Network  IIRON  gathered in a small room in a nearby office building to strategize. Those willing to be arrested passed off their valuables to friends for safekeeping. <PARAGRAPH> “[Durbin is] called a champion of the people, but if you’re not willing to take a risk and go against the grain, you’re not a real champion,” Rev. Marilyn Pagán-Banks, executive director of the hunger relief and economic justice group A Just Harvest, tells In These Times. “We’re taking a risk getting arrested today, so he needs to take a risk as well. Lives are at stake here.” <PARAGRAPH> Pagán-Banks was part of a small group of coalition members who met with Durbin in Washington, D.C. in May about the budget debates and were unsatisfied with his answers. They are demanding that he take a strong public stand in support of taxing the rich and protecting average Americans. <PARAGRAPH> University of Chicago student Jacob Swenson, who was arrested during the Friday action, notes, “They’ve been willing to rack up debt for 10 years on two wars, and now they are saying we have to get serious about the debt when it means cuts to programs that serve the poor and ailing.” <PARAGRAPH> He wishes the government would address the budget crisis by stimulating growth through a New Deal-type program that creates jobs, rather than a plan that “puts our communities on the chopping block” as he wrote in a piece for Truthout. After graduating from college in 2007, Swenson, like many people he knew, was unable to find permanent employment and took temp jobs for $10 an hour with no benefits. He's now a graduate student and instructor at the University of Chicago.  <PARAGRAPH> “Unfortunately the Obama administration and our own Senator Durbin are relatively immune to learning from experience,” he tells In These Times. “They talked about compromise for four years, and look what it got us. And it’s not a genuine compromise when 50 percent of the elected officials are arguing for the benefit of a fraction of Americans.” <PARAGRAPH> Sequestration and the fiscal cliff <PARAGRAPH> The Make Wall Street Pay coalition demands that Durbin support the “Robin Hood” financial transaction tax; allow no cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid; and oppose extending the Bush-era tax cuts currently set to expire at the end of the year. <PARAGRAPH> Durbin has voiced support for the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan as a solution to the “fiscal cliff.” However, economic justice groups say the plan disproportionately hurts low-income and working people, and doesn’t place enough burden on the rich. The plan, drafted by former President Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson, the co-chairs of Obama's Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, would include about $2.9 trillion in cuts, about half of which have already been made, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. <PARAGRAPH> In a 2010 op-ed, Durbin defended his position  in third-person : <PARAGRAPH> Why is a progressive like Dick Durbin voting for this deficit commission report? First, all politicians, left or right, Democrat or Republican, have to acknowledge the deficit crisis our nation faces. Borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar we spend for missiles or food stamps is unsustainable. And being indebted for generations to China and OPEC does not make American a stronger nation. <PARAGRAPH> As The Christian Science Monitor explained, there is no doubt that impending cuts will be extremely severe, but it is still unclear exactly what impacts they would have on different services and jobs. The likely cumulative effect has been compared to an austerity program similar to the measures that created massive public uprising and social distress in Europe in the past few years.  <PARAGRAPH> Outrage across Chicago <PARAGRAPH> As the Make Wall Street Pay Coalition targeted Durbin, the Chicago Federation of Labor held a press conference on November 8 urging outgoing Congress members, such as right-wing Rep. Joe Walsh  R-Ill. , “not to slash vital programs” during the lame duck session. Since November 8, Chicago unions have funded a television ad that asks “elected officials to stand up for the middle class following the election,” according to a statement from the federation. <PARAGRAPH> Tom Balanoff, president of SEIU Local 1, which represents janitors, security guards and other Chicago workers, tells In These Times that the federal budget negotiations and other political and economic trends mean Americans are poised to lose the social safety net and the “American dream” that generations of unions and social movements have fought to preserve. <PARAGRAPH> “If we really want to raise standards in this country, we have to raise revenue through fair taxes and we need to raise people’s wages,” he says. “They want to eliminate Social Security and Medicare–these aren’t ‘entitlements,’ these are things we have worked for and paid for that they keep chipping away at. There’s already a huge gap between the haves and the have-nots. If they eliminate the safety net, what is the difference between us and a ‘third world’ country?”
At ‘Official’ Budget Hearing, Chicagoans Find Official Indifference and Empty Chairs | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO—During three community budget hearings this month, Chicago union members and other regular residents voiced their fears about the priorities of the city’s proposed 2013 budget, which many worry could spell privatization, layoffs and service cuts. Those hearings were unofficial events, however, hosted by a handful of city councilmen in the Progressive Caucus, since Mayor Rahm Emanuel declined to hold the customary evening hearings for the public to discuss the budget. <PARAGRAPH> Someone who attended Chicago’s only official public budget hearing at noon on October 31 might have thought they were in an entirely different city. Nearly every speaker praised the budget and thanked the mayor for creating jobs and making the city more business-friendly. A plumbers union business agent described Emanuel as “such a strong supporter of organized labor”  an unusual perspective . <PARAGRAPH> There were only a few critics, as most of the concerned residents who had flocked to the alternative hearings either didn’t know about the poorly publicized “official” hearing or could not leave work midday to attend. <PARAGRAPH> Perhaps it didn’t matter, since more than half the city’s aldermen didn’t bother to attend. Also absent was Mayor Emanuel himself. <PARAGRAPH> City Clerk Susana Mendoza kicked off the hearing by reading the official notice that had been published in The Chicago Sun-Times 12 days earlier: “The budget document is in pamphlet form and has been conveniently made available for inspection at the city clerk’s office and in the Harold Washington Library,” she recited, then left the room. <PARAGRAPH> Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce vice president of policy Mike Mini thanked the mayor for eliminating the “head tax” that makes it more expensive to hire employees and for promising not to raise taxes. He said, “It’s more important than ever we enact policies to position ourselves as the most business-friendly city in America.” Chicago Hilton general manager John Wells praised Emanuel on the same grounds and noted that the hotel business is picking up and should be offering more jobs. <PARAGRAPH> James F. Coyne, business manager of the of the plumbers union Local 130 UA, said the plumbers “wholeheartedly support Mayor Emanuel’s budget,” noting that jobs will be created by the city’s plans for badly-needed sewer and water system overhauls. Coyne also invited veteran alderman Ed Burke, whose grandfather co-founded the union, to sing a ditty about plumbers “protecting the health of the nation.” Burke recited the words: “So when your water is clear and bright, then you know your pipes are tight, and you know a union plumber put them there.” <PARAGRAPH> AFSCME Council 31 policy and legislative specialist Adrienne Alexander was the first critical voice, presenting the union’s recent report on the impacts of closing six city mental health clinics. She noted that about 500 patients had “disappeared” from city records, disproportionately black and Latino staff had been laid off, and the remaining staff had inherited much greater workloads. <PARAGRAPH> “Aldermen, at a point you’re not doing more with less, you’re just doing less,” Alexander said. “We ask you, don’t support this budget that continues the privatization and diminishment of public services.” <PARAGRAPH> Then came Jorge Castellanos, wearing a purple SEIU T-shirt saying “Chicago needs a responsible bidders ordinance.” In careful heavily-accented English, Castellanos read from a statement: <PARAGRAPH> “This summer I lost my job as a janitor at the water department when the city replaced my employer with an irresponsible contractor. When a new company took over they fired me and my five co-workers even though we had years of experience. The mayor’s office changed to a non-union contractor…That doesn’t make sense, we have good jobs with decent wages and have insurance. Now we are struggling. It has been four months and I still have not found a job. I’m worried about paying my bills and tuition for my son in college. The workers that replaced us are paid low wages and don’t have insurance. I don’t think that helps working families, to eliminate good middle-class jobs…It makes me sad that our mayor did this to hard-working Chicagoans. Some of us have been working at city buildings for five, 10 and even more than 15 years. This is why I’m coming here, you know…I tell Mayor Emanuel please don’t cut good jobs for the people. Thank you so much and God bless you.” <PARAGRAPH> Castellanos’s remarks were met with complete silence. In contrast, previous speakers touting domestic-violence programs and community-development agencies had received gushing support and game questions from the aldermen. <PARAGRAPH> Lonnell Saffold, institutional division director for SEIU Local 1, spoke next, pointing out that by hiring a cheaper contractor who laid off Castellanos and his coworkers, the city of Chicago would just be transferring costs to taxpayers in other ways. Deprived of their wages and health insurance, the laid-off workers will likely be relying on the county system for health care and collecting federal unemployment benefits.   <PARAGRAPH> “You don’t take people making $14 an hour and take their jobs, their health care to balance the budget,” Saffold said, calling for the city to pass the responsible bidders ordinance which would help protect union jobs under private contractors. “They did nothing wrong–they paid their taxes, they want to send their kids to school and have a good opportunity for the American dream. But their dreams have been shattered because someone decided it was a good idea to give their jobs to non-union contractors.” <PARAGRAPH> The number of aldermen in the room had dwindled even more by the time George Blakemore walked up to make his comment. For years Blakemore has been a constant fixture at public meetings of every sort, offering his opinions and proposals—often calls for more resources for the African American community. Blakemore respectfully thanked the council for holding a public budget meeting but noted that “most of your comrades do not feel the need to be present at this public process.” <PARAGRAPH> Dressed sharply in a brown suit and patterned tie, he noted that he used to wear ratty old clothes to the annual budget hearings, but he’d decided to start dressing up to lend a little more dignity to the process. “But it’s still the same thing, still this dog and pony show around the budget and still the same thing – the black community receives peanuts.” <PARAGRAPH> The next speaker, who had “endured indignities” making his way downtown from a poor African American neighborhood on the West Side, gestured ruefully at the “empty chairs” and the chatting aldermen who “don’t even want to hear what I have to say because they’re holding another meeting over there.” Then West Side resident Paul McKinley denounced “a Caligula-style mayor who refused to face the public, who refused to face society,” before getting into a shouting match with an alderwoman over his allegations that she allowed a convenience store to openly sell bullets. <PARAGRAPH> The aldermen were still muttering over McKinley’s outburst as the final speaker, Jeanette Hansen, made her points. A former patient at one of the shuttered mental health clinics, Hansen extolled the skills and compassion of her therapist, Eric Lindquist, and reminded the few aldermen who were paying attention that fellow patient Helen Morley had died after their clinic was closed. “There’s a stigma attached to mental illness, we know this,” she said. “But it’s an illness like any other, it’s a chemical imbalance in the brain and it’s not our fault.” <PARAGRAPH> Hansen noted that access to stable therapy and medication are key to giving mentally ill people a better chance to work and support themselves. She said she had worked for the city for 15 years writing parking tickets. She now relies on food stamps but hopes to become self-sufficient by making artistic trinkets and selling them with a peddlers’ license. <PARAGRAPH> Her conclusion about the budget: “All I can say is pennywise and pound-foolish. Thank you.” <PARAGRAPH> As soon as she finished speaking the moderator called on Ed Burke, the city’s most powerful alderman, to officially adjourn. But they had to wait, as he was on his cell phone.
Chicagoans Ask City Councillors To Fight Emanuel’s Cruelest Cuts | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO—Today, members of the City Council's Progressive Caucus are delivering the news to Mayor Rahm Emanuel and about 40 of their fellow councilmen that scores of Chicagoans have deep reservations about the proposed 2013 budget and what it means for jobs, families and public sector unions. Many Chicagoans are furious, afraid and skeptical about the proposed budget that they charge will usher in another wave of privatization, layoffs and service cuts in the name of “reform,” efficiency and deficit reduction. <PARAGRAPH> But Emanuel and a great majority of the 50 city councilmen might not be aware of these concerns, because Emanuel broke with almost three decades of tradition by refusing to hold evening public meetings about the budget. Instead he is offering a public hearing today—an under-publicized event in the middle of the day which many working people will not be able to attend—and he has invited the submission of comments online. <PARAGRAPH> Unions, community groups and the progressive city councilmen have said this isn’t good enough, so the Progressive Caucus held three hearings of their own, including one yesterday at a South Side high school. <PARAGRAPH> As at the other two meetings, attendees yesterday railed against privatization of city jobs and services, from the water department to animal control to the finance department and emergency response call centers to janitorial services and charter schools. Members of SEIU, AFSCME and the Chicago Teachers Union turned out in force for the meetings, describing in sometimes wrenching detail the impact of last year’s budget cuts and the possible effect of the proposed 2013 budget on public sector workers and their families. <PARAGRAPH> Contracts and Cuts <PARAGRAPH> In some cases, city service jobs are already privatized, in that they are contracted out to private contractors. But Emanuel’s aggressive push to find cheaper contracts has meant endangering or simply ending union jobs, replacing them with non-union and lower-paid jobs with contractors who offered the city a cheaper deal. In his  mayoral victory speech in May 2011, Emanuel said: <PARAGRAPH> “It’s time for tough choices because denial in the face of challenge is no strategy for success. … As we move forward, we face serious new challenges and overcoming them will not be easy. It requires new ideas, cooperation and sacrifice from everyone involved. We must make sure that every community in Chicago is heard and included and has a chance to participate in that future.” <PARAGRAPH> Critics point out that Chicagoans have had to make plenty of sacrifices in the past year, including with their jobs and pensions, but the mayor’s failure to hold community budget hearings shows a lack of genuine interest in community input and participation. <PARAGRAPH> At the alternative budget hearings, residents and community leaders also repeatedly pointed out that cost-cutting contracts and layoffs often have significant hidden costs, from sub-par performance and cost over-runs to the fact that contractors do not need to live within city limits and hence may not channel their wages into Chicago’s tax base. <PARAGRAPH> While the 2013 budget doesn’t explicitly propose many layoffs, union leaders and others who have analyzed it fear de facto layoffs and job cuts through privatization and competitive bidding. At yesterday's hearing, speakers stressed how minority workers and communities are likely to be disproportionately impacted by belt-tightening in the 2013 budget, just as they were in 2012. <PARAGRAPH> “They’re dismantling our office, which is primarily minorities,” said Greg Turner, an employee of the city’s finance department call center. <PARAGRAPH> Low-income minority neighborhoods are suffering a double whammy, as public service cuts and privatization mean poor or low-income minority residents lose jobs, while also likely losing city services. <PARAGRAPH> Mental Health Movement <PARAGRAPH> A perfect example is the closing of six of the city’s 12 public mental health clinics last spring, which meant the layoff of numerous staff, disproportionately minorities. AFSCME, which represents workers at mental health clinics, released a report yesterday that analyzes the impact of the clinic closings. It found that between 500 and 2,000 clinic patients have “disappeared” from city records between 2011 and 2012, depending how their cases are classified. The report says the statistical discrepancy indicates that hundreds or possibly thousands of patients were never notified by the city about their options in the face of the clinic closings, and instead relied on the grassroots, all-volunteer Mental Health Movement for information. <PARAGRAPH> AFSCME Special Projects Director and report author Jo Patton said that, “A number of therapists we’ve talked to now have more than 100 patients. We want the city to rehire Spanish-speaking therapists, African-American therapists, male therapists, because those things have a lot to do with how people bond with their therapist.  <PARAGRAPH> The special bond patients develop with hard-working, caring therapists—and how important that connection can be to their very survival—is one of the factors that can easily get overlooked in a bottom-line driven approach that ignores effects on the ground in communities. <PARAGRAPH> Before the budget hearing, Jeanette Hansen and Margaret Sullivan described to me how their therapist Eric Lindquist at the now-closed Beverly-Morgan Park mental health clinic has literally saved patients’ lives. <PARAGRAPH> “I’m manic depressive, I see black and white, I felt like if the world doesn’t want me alive then fine,” said Sullivan, 58, a former college English professor with a doctorate from UCLA, about a crisis she suffered a decade ago. “But Eric talked me into living another week. He taught me how to stay alive, he told me you go out into the community, he got me tutoring and working with special needs kids.” <PARAGRAPH> They said Lindquist moved to the far southwest side neighborhood from the city’s north side in order to be closer to work and his patients, and that he would often “cross the alley” from his home to meet with a patient or take a phone call after hours. Sullivan said that she and other clinic clients became desperately despondent upon hearing the clinic would close, but Lindquist urged them to channel their despair into activism, opening a whole new world to them in the process. <PARAGRAPH> Now Sullivan and Hansen travel up to two hours by public transportation to see Lindquist at the clinic where he has been reassigned.  At least they have that option, difficult as it can be. Many therapists were laid off—including all of the African-American male therapists in the system, according to AFSCME—so many patients are completely cut-off from the people who had been their lifeline. <PARAGRAPH> The Mental Health Movement, a group of clinic patients and supporters that coalesced after former Mayor Richard M. Daley proposed closing clinics in 2009, has demanded that the 2013 budget include funds to reopen the six closed clinics to fully staff all clinics. They are also calling for more mental health resources in the schools, especially given the violence and other trauma many students face. <PARAGRAPH> Police Officers and Politics <PARAGRAPH> The October 30 community budget hearing was moderated by Cliff Kelley, a popular radio host and former Chicago city councilman. He noted that, “You know what group has asked me to try to keep those mental health clinics open? The police.” <PARAGRAPH> Police officers, who are currently engaged in contentious contract negotiations with the mayor’s office, are stretched thin, especially given the escalating gang violence that has made international news this year. Mental Health Movement members say that during their various sit-ins and occupations over the past year, including a stand-off at one of the clinics about to be closed, police officers have been sympathetic. Chicagoans with mental health issues and police officers have publicly agreed that law enforcement is not equipped to deal with and should not be burdened with people causing disturbances because of mental illness. <PARAGRAPH> Speakers at the hearing chastened the aldermen for voting unanimously for the 2012 budget, which included the clinic closings and hundreds of job cuts. <PARAGRAPH> They also praised the aldermen for holding the alternative hearings, and challenged them to stand up to the mayor, promising political support in return. They directed this message particularly at Alderman Bob Fioretti, whose ward has basically disappeared as a result of gerrymandered redistricting—a move some described as retaliation for his speaking out against last year’s budget. <PARAGRAPH> Members of the Mental Health Movement and other critics pointed out that last year 28 aldermen signed a letter criticizing cuts in the 2012 budget, including the clinic closings, but then ultimately voted for it. Many think they backed off in fear of Emanuel’s power in general and the idea that he wants to cut in half the number of city councilmen. <PARAGRAPH> “Please aldermen, don’t let this be a 50-0 vote,” said Barney Franklin, president of AFSCME Local 2946, which represents employees of the city water department targeted for privatization. “If you support us we will support you.”
Chicago Chicanos ‘Read Out’ in Solidarity with Tucson | <PARAGRAPH> Books can save your life. <PARAGRAPH> Especially if you are growing up in a rough area, faced with discrimination, racism, poverty, violence and a dominant culture that seems to belittle your family’s history and your very existence. <PARAGRAPH> That’s how celebrated author and community leader Luis J. Rodriguez described his youthful relationship with books. Growing up in a tough L.A. neighborhood where a gang attack left him with a damaged chin at age 11, Rodriguez was a young heroin addict and gang member. He eventually left that life and became an internationally-known writer, artist and youth advocate. The shift started with a book of Mexican murals given to him by a counselor who was also a Chicano activist with the radical Brown Berets. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Now, Rodriguez’s books are among those banned from public school curriculums in Tuscon, Ariz. as part of an attack on Mexican American studies by the city’s school board and a state law. On Sunday, at the Taller Mestizarte gallery in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, Rodriguez read from one of his own books and spoke about the larger importance of books dealing with politics, Chicano culture and popular movements. <PARAGRAPH> There was much attention last year to the removal of a long list of book titles from Tucson schools after the school board became afraid that ethnic studies violated a 2010 state law prohibiting courses “designed primarily for pupils of one ethnic group” that “advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals” or promote “resentment toward a race or class of people.” In These Times covered the efforts of Tucson student activists to organize their own ethnic studies classes, as well as a month-long “No History is Illegal” campaign to incorporate the banned Mexican American studies curriculum into classrooms across the country last February. <PARAGRAPH> But Chicano, Latino and other activists and educators in Chicago feel that the issue has now dropped off the public radar. They fear that attacks on free speech, education and ethnic studies will spread around the country if people don’t continue to fight the Tucson school board. <PARAGRAPH> That’s why Rodriguez – who previously lived in Chicago and founded Tia Chucha Press here – joined local artists, activists, students and teachers in the small Pilsen gallery to read from books on Tucson’s banned list. Appropriately, the event was held on 18th Street in Pilsen, a hotbed of Chicano organizing in decades past. <PARAGRAPH> Rodriguez remembered how, along with receiving the book from the Brown Beret, “an Anglo teacher opened up the world of books for me.” He also recalled how librarians would watch him with an eagle eye, suspecting he intended to steal books. At an independent bookstore owned by a Jewish-American man in his own rough neighborhood, Rodriguez said the owner would “watch me not because he thought I would steal but because he wanted to see what my interests were.” <PARAGRAPH> While homeless and living beside the Los Angeles River, Rodriguez would stow books in little “cubby holes” and other secret spots. “Books, man!” he reiterated. “They save your life … This is why the battle in Tucson is important.” <PARAGRAPH> On the gallery walls between bright abstract paintings were cardboard signs reading, “Save Ethnic Studies” and “History is not Illegal.” <PARAGRAPH> Antonio Zavala, one of the Pilsen event organizers, invoked Ray Bradbury’s famous Fahrenheit 451 as a cautionary tale. He paraphrased the Tuscon school board members’ contentions that the Chicano and other ethnic studies programs teach hatred toward Anglos and foster an “us versus them” environment. <PARAGRAPH> “They want to promote this idea that ‘Just work hard and you’ll make it,’” he said. “But that’s a big fallacy – just look at the African American community, they’ve worked hard through so many conditions and they’re still looked on as second class citizens … This is a designated attack on the rights of Mexican Americans and their culture and right to education.” <PARAGRAPH> Two participants read from Laura Esquivel’s book Like Water for Chocolate, pointing out the important cultural symbolism and mocking the fact that the school board saw such tales of food and desire as threatening. <PARAGRAPH> “What do they have against chefs … what do they have against love?” asked participant, after reading stanzas from the book. After reading a fragment about “punish[ing] Tita for her willfulness,” she said, “Ah! Maybe that’s it, willfulness.” <PARAGRAPH> Another participant read from 500 Years of Chicano History, pointing out that she could see why it might be seen as threatening in a state rife with anti-immigrant and racist dynamics…and that is all the more reason to make sure students have the chance to read and discuss the material. She pointed out how “Anglos put the label of bandit on our resistance heroes.” Several others read from Paoulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed and from Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States. <PARAGRAPH> The next step for Tucson organizers will be a three-day “Tucson Freedom Coalition” convergence in November, where they hope to unite a national movement around the battle for ethnic studies in Arizona. <PARAGRAPH> Dr. Teresa Cordova, director of the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said at Sunday’s event, “I had the opportunity to go to the university because of the Chicano movement…So I always felt like my education was not my own but belonged to the community.” <PARAGRAPH> “One of the reasons they’re afraid of the Pedagogy of the Oppressed is the idea of using education as a way for people to understand the context under which they live and the possibility for transforming it,” Cordova continued. “That we are not just victims but agents of transformation.”
At Alt Budget Hearing, Chicagoans Decry Privatization and Job Cuts | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO–Labor leaders and workers fear that the proposed 2013 budget, which the City Council will vote on November 15, could mean many job cuts as the city moves to increase efficiency, cut services and possibly introduce more privatization in various departments. <PARAGRAPH> Chicago union leaders say it is unclear exactly what the economic and job impacts of the proposed budget will be for public-sector workers and other residents, and there are not as many obvious job cuts as last year’s budget. In his budget address to the City Council on October 10, Mayor Rahm Emanuel promised no new taxes or fees in spite of the $298 million budget shortfall, and said 500 new police officers would be hired and 275 “unnecessary” administrative positions eliminated. But even union and community leaders who have parsed the recently released voluminous document say it is unclear what exactly it means for the city. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, residents feel they have been denied the chance to get more information and voice their opinions, especially since Mayor Rahm Emanuel has decided not to hold a series of evening neighborhood public meetings as has been the norm since former Mayor Harold Washington started them three decades ago. In response, city councilmembers of the Progressive Caucus are holding three evening community meetings of their own, including one at a high school the evening of Oct. 24 <PARAGRAPH> There, numerous residents—many of them public-sector union members—voiced their concerns about privatization, job loss, discrimination and the overall priorities of the city administration. <PARAGRAPH> “I was laid off from the Office of Emergency Management, I worked here for 16 years and now a contractor is doing my job,” said one woman, who proceeded to speak for much more than her allocated three minutes, reciting her resume and attributes in a desperate plea for work. “I am dedicated, dependable…I am job ready. I was born and raised in this city, I love this city and I love the people,” she said. <PARAGRAPH> Ben Joravsky of the Chicago Reader and other critics have noted that former Mayor Richard M. Daley was known to look bored, distracted and even leave the room as residents addressed him during budget hearings, but at least he attended the meetings that ran late into the evenings in diverse neighborhoods across the city. They have blasted Emanuel for not making even a half-hearted effort to hear public opinion first hand before the budget is finalized. <PARAGRAPH> “For an administration that’s pledged to openness and transparency, they shut the public out,” said Alderman Bob Fioretti, one of the hosts of the community hearing. “I’m concerned about the direction of our city and what this budget does.” <PARAGRAPH> “No es justo  it’s an injustice ,  said Alderman Ricardo Muñoz, among the eight council members who promised to listen to community concerns and share them with the full council. <PARAGRAPH> Alderman Toni Foulkes said she’s concerned about constituents like an unemployed man who called her office, worried what would happen to his family if his wife lost her job at the water department through privatization or cuts. <PARAGRAPH> Loud clapping and cheering from the crowd of several hundred greeted each statement about privatization and Emanuel’s attacks on public unions. <PARAGRAPH> “Privatization is for political purposes only,” said Robert Stone. “If contractors want to get city work, they give donations to politicians who are all too willing to lay off public employees. But private contractors do not do as good a job as city workers.” <PARAGRAPH> Several speakers noted that employees of private contractors don’t need to live within Chicago like city workers do, so replacing city workers with contractors can mean the tax base in Chicago is essentially diluted. <PARAGRAPH> “Non-residents are taking our jobs,” said Caroline Broeren, a librarian who has seen first-hand the impact of cuts to the library system in last year’s budget—though much of those cuts were restored thanks to a campaign by the AFSCME union. “We want to be able to continue providing services to the people who live in our communities, but we’re having that taken away from us by privatization. And the low initial bids of contractors end up costing a lot more later – not just financially – as an employee of the city I care about what happens in the city. I don’t know that private contractors will.” <PARAGRAPH> Lula White, a member of AFSCME Local 505 and an employee of the city’s health department, said that last year’s cuts to public mental health and general care clinics have been devastating. She said that since six mental health clinics were closed and other clinics were privatized, needy patients have fallen through the cracks. <PARAGRAPH> “We or I should say the mayor and his budget have cut the health services,” White said. “My question for you all  aldermen  who voted for the budget last year” is have the patients displaced from the shuttered mental health clinics found their way to other clinics? “The patients are not there … where are they?” <PARAGRAPH> Sijisfredo Aviles, a volunteer with the affordable housing organization Bickerdike, noted “the loss of jobs keep many of my family and friends in poverty and many are homeless. I personally have to juggle my monthly social security check with paying my rent, healthcare and personal needs.” He said that even the affordable housing Bickerdike offers “is out of reach for dozens of people in my community because of the poverty wages they receive.” He called on the mayor to “make sure funds are used responsibly in our community and not downtown for corporate welfare,” highlighting the use of TIF  tax increment financing  taxpayer funds to subsidize the River Point Plaza outside a luxurious downtown office building. <PARAGRAPH> In his budget address, Emanuel said $25 million in surplus funds from the controversial TIF program would go back into general city coffers. The Grassroots Collaborative and other groups are calling on him to make sure those funds benefit people in the neighborhoods that need it most. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel also said the $298 million projected deficit is the smallest since the 2008 recession started. He said more than 4,000 jobs are being created by bringing new corporate headquarters and other employers to Chicago, and he thanked “Labor,” specifically the Laborers' Local 1001 union and SEIU Local 73, for working with the city to make reforms that will save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. In many cases these reforms are what concern workers and union leaders—for example the institution of competitive bidding  i.e., potential privatization  for airport janitorial work, tree-trimming and planting, recycling and other services—even city legal work, “starting with legal services for workers’ compensation.” <PARAGRAPH> At the community hearing, skeptical residents not only railed against privatization but offered some of their own suggestions. <PARAGRAPH> Joe Zefran called for city support of worker-owned cooperatives. Clearly referring to Walmart and Target, he said: “We really want to talk about what kind of jobs we want to attract and what kind of businesses we want to attract. Some of these companies coming in from northwest Arkansas and Minnesota are beneath our dignity – they’re not the kinds of jobs we want to see.” <PARAGRAPH> Long-time county government employee and activist Chris Geovanis called on the city council to pass measures to protect workers from privatization and job cuts. <PARAGRAPH> “We’ve asked the city of Chicago to do things like passing a  new, more comprehensive  living wage ordnance; we need to revisit that,” she said. “We need to see  city or state  legislation proposed that mirrors the  federal proposed  Employee Free Choice Act. … That would provide minimum safeguards for public-sector workers, and also these public workers being privatized out and brought back at slave wages. ... Those are the kind of ordinances we need to see from our aldermen, and we need to see a no vote on this budget.”
New Contract Spells Good News for 1,200 Chicago Airport Workers—Unless City Moots It | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> On Oct. 19, after four months of bargaining, UNITE HERE Local 1 union ratified a contract ensuring better wages and health insurance for 1,200 store, café and restaurant workers at Chicago’s two airports, O'Hare and Midway. The new contract with company HMS Host will put a total of $10 million more in airport workers’ pockets, which means $10 million more circulating in the working-class Chicago neighborhoods where many of them live, says UNITE HERE Local 1 president Henry Tamarin. <PARAGRAPH> But the contract could become moot if the Chicago Department of Aviation, which administers the airports, decides to hire different companies for the concessions contracts up for renewal this fall. The department is currently conducting bidding on three-quarters of the food and retail contracts at O’Hare and Midway airports, worth around $250 million annually, according to UNITE HERE. If new contractors are hired, they could lay off up to 1,500 existing workers  including those in Local 1  and bring in new workers at lower wages, without union representation. <PARAGRAPH> That’s why union leaders, workers, pastors and a handful of Chicago aldermen are calling for passage of the Stable Jobs, Stable Airports ordinance. The ordinance mandates a living wage for airport concessions workers and requires new contractors to hire existing workers for a trial period of 90 days. It would close what the union calls a “loophole” in the city’s Living Wage Ordinance, which mandates a living wage of $11.53 an hour for other contractors on city jobs, but does not apply to airport concessions. <PARAGRAPH> Hundreds of workers and their supporters met at the Chicago Temple on Tuesday morning and then held a rally on the second floor of City Hall, calling on the aldermen on the city council’s aviation committee to move the ordinance forward. <PARAGRAPH> Tameka Shivers, who spoke at the gathering, has been working at O’Hare through HMS Host for six years. She has three kids, including an 8-year-old with Down’s Syndrome and a 3-year-old who is a carrier for sickle cell disease, making health insurance unaffordable. <PARAGRAPH> “I make $10.50 an hour, which is not a living wage here in Chicago, but due to the new victory which we won last week, in a year I’ll be making a living wage,” she told the crowd at the temple. “This is a huge victory not only for me but for my family and my coworkers and their families as well. I will be able to move my kids into a safe neighborhood … and with the new contract I will be able to afford health insurance.” <PARAGRAPH> When the ordinance goes up for a vote, she said, “I’m calling on all the aldermen to remember me—remember this beautiful single mother who has been fighting for security for her children.” <PARAGRAPH> Aida Olavarria, 62, started working at a restaurant at O’Hare International Airport 25 years ago, after selling the small grocery store on Chicago’s northwest side that she had owned for 16 years. Like the grocery store, her restaurant cashier job gives her the chance to interact with people all day, so she enjoys it even though the wages are low and she is often rushing to do several jobs at once–delivering salads and condiments while she is supposed to be working the register. Since she helps support her daughter and grandson, getting by is a struggle. <PARAGRAPH> “When you have to pay the rent, the groceries, the car, health insurance, and some people have kids to send to college, these days it is too hard,” she tells Working In These Times. “These companies make good money, they could pay us a little more.” <PARAGRAPH> Aldermen speaking at the temple referred to their own immigrant and working class family histories in describing the ripple effect of decent jobs in building strong communities. Alderman Danny Solis described his Mexican immigrant father working three jobs while his mother worked at a Laundromat. Alderman Tim Cullerton, a union member for 42 years, noted that his family came to Chicago during the Irish potato famine. <PARAGRAPH> “We started working on the Illinois Michigan canal in the mud and the muck—we had to buy our shovels from the company store, we had to buy our food from the company store—but that job gave us our dignity,” he said of the family history. He said economic conditions in the northwest part of the city he represents are the toughest he’s ever seen them. “We have the highest foreclosure rates I have seen…when I’m campaigning, many people aren’t home on weekends and nights—they are out working two or three jobs, trying to hold on to their homes. We’re not asking for a handout, we’re not asking for a bailout, we’re just asking for some dignity and living wages.” <PARAGRAPH> Peggy Willis has worked for seven years at a Starbucks at O’Hare, and she said she has regular customers who know she will have their favorite drinks ready for them. She is counting on the job to put her three-year-old son Jeremiah through college. “He will go to college no matter what,” she said. <PARAGRAPH> As David Moberg reported for Working In These Times last March, UNITE HERE Local 1 now represents about 1,300 out of 2,300 total airport concession workers, thanks to years of organizing. But new concessions could gut their efforts and mean lower wages across the board. <PARAGRAPH> Academic studies have shown that paying all Chicago airport concession workers a living wage would mean up to $8 million annually in extra wages, and that 18 other major airports have policies similar to the proposed airport ordinance, including LAX, JFK, LaGuardia, Miami, San Francisco, Seattle, Newark, San Diego and Cleveland. A similar ordinance was introduced in Chicago last year but never passed; now it’s on the city council docket again. Citizen Action Illinois co-director William McNary said the price increases needed to pay workers a living wage are minimal. <PARAGRAPH> “This is not going to cost people a whole lot of money,” he said. “To add either 16 or 19 cents to that hamburger so workers can have a living wage, so Peggy can think about her son going to college. We’re not asking to break the bank, we’re asking the people who make millions to give up nickels.”
Chicagoans Give Rahm Emanuel Poor Grades | <PARAGRAPH> At an October 22 forum sponsored by Columbia College, three prominent Chicago political analysts gave Mayor Rahm Emanuel grades ranging from  C  to  D-  to  incomplete.  Emanuel lost points because of his battle with the Chicago Teachers Union and his looming confrontations in negotiations with the transit workers, firefighters and police unions. <PARAGRAPH> The speakers—professors from DePaul University and from Columbia College, and Chicago Reader firebrand columnist Ben Joravsky—each speculated that Emanuel’s labor problems stemmed from the mayor's infamously combative personality. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Larry Bennett, a political science professor at DePaul who gave Emanuel an  incomplete  since the mayor is mid-term, offered three hypotheses as to why the mayor took “such an aggressive approach” with the teachers: <PARAGRAPH> Did Mayor Emanuel really think the Chicago Teachers Union was the devil and in order to improve public education in Chicago you have to break the teachers union? <PARAGRAPH> [Or] was Mayor Emanuel’s approach in some sense political—[as though] taking a hard line with the teachers union was going to endear him with certain constituencies which would be of use to him? <PARAGRAPH> Or was it possibly produced by a character flaw—a reflexive tendency to bully people who you ought to engage in a cooperative effort? <PARAGRAPH> Joravsky, too, raised the possibility that Emanuel’s stubbornness and impulsivity played a role in the showdown with the Chicago Teachers Union. He noted that tensions first rose when Emanuel insisted on demanding a longer school day—despite the fact that there was not money to pay teachers for their extra work and neither teachers nor parents cited school day length as a major problem. <PARAGRAPH> “A prudent wise view of public schools would somehow distinguish between all the contrasting needs and try to apportion what little money we have,” Joravsky said. “That would require working with your public, unions, principals, etc. Instead Mayor Rahm continued to campaign—he had campaigned on extending the day, he was going to extend the day no matter who got in his way—and we had debacle led to the teachers strike.” <PARAGRAPH> Joravsky gave Emanuel an “incomplete” for his performance as mayor but a  D-  in terms of his larger political career, blaming Emanuel not only for an anti-union ideology but also for grossly underestimating the power and popularity of the teachers union. He thinks this crucial mistake—on its face surprising from such an ambitious and intelligent politician—came because Emanuel “wasn’t born in Chicago, he hardly ever lived in Chicago, as far as I could tell he never thought much about Chicago, he’s learning what Chicago is as he goes along.” <PARAGRAPH> “He came to the conclusion that the Chicago teachers union was not important to him—that like unions in general they were losing power, losing membership, very unpopular among the rank and file, and he could probably advance his career by getting in a fight with them.” <PARAGRAPH> Dominic Pacyga, a history professor at Columbia College, gave Emanuel a  C  largely because of his embattled relationship with labor, including the police and firefighters unions. He said that given the city’s soaring murder rate, which has gained international attention in the past year, the city should be hiring 2,000 additional officers rather than trimming police budgets. <PARAGRAPH> Pacyga also thinks Emanuel’s administration should do more to bring in blue-collar jobs and build on Chicago’s existing manufacturing base, especially by utilizing land on the city’s vast Southeast side. <PARAGRAPH> “There are a lot of people here who need work, people who don’t want to go to college, who don’t want to be part of the digital revolution; they want good paying jobs so they can pay a mortgage,” he said. “Chicago is still one of the best manufacturing centers of the United States, we do produce a lot of things here and we can continue that if City Hall has a logical realistic plan.” <PARAGRAPH> When an attendee who had worked on Emanuel’s campaign requested that the panelists discuss the mayor’s successes, there was an awkward silence. Joravsky offered the only concrete response, praising Emanuel's recent decriminalization of marijuana. Bennett described Emanuel as “a lifestyle liberal [who] appeals to bike riders such as myself ... he’s developing a cultural plan, he will be attentive to gays and lesbians…there’s a way he carves out a liberal niche for himself even as he pushes forward a city government that is fundamentally business-oriented.  <PARAGRAPH> The panelists discussed the Mayor’s penchant for privatization, and noted that in certain contexts it might be a smart move that can improve services and create jobs, such as in the privatization of garbage pickup. But Bennett warned against applying privatization as a catch-all to more complicated sectors like education: <PARAGRAPH> To me the issue with the business approach to city government is that while there’s no such thing as a public versus private sector way to collect garbage, things like running public schools are more complicated. In the United States the greatest social problem we confront is increasing economic and social inequality. One way I expect that to be further exacerbated is the collapse of the public education system where all kinds of consumers with all kinds of resources and ability to choose schools are set loose to choose schools and those people with what we social scientists so nicely call social capital and also real capital will get good educations and the others won’t…Too simply say we have to fix schools by privatizing them doesn’t even begin to address those problems.
Hannity's immigration evolution draws praise from conservative Latino group | Sean Hannity’s announcement that he has “evolved” on immigration is drawing praise from a conservative Latino organization. <paragraph> Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, on Friday applauded Hannity for telling his radio listeners he now supports a pathway to citizenship for those in the United States without criminal records. <paragraph> “Sean Hannity has taken a bold step and conservatives are behind him. It is time to allow the market — rather than a bureaucratic federal government — to determine our immigration policy,”  <hyperlink> Aguilar said, according to a press release. <paragraph> “The tidal wave of support for real reform is growing,”  <hyperlink> Aguilar said. <paragraph> “There is a growing momentum within the conservative movement to embrace a market-based immigration plan that is in line with Ronald Reagan, who said it best:  ‘No regulation or law should be allowed if it results in crops rotting in the fields for lack of harvesters,’”  <hyperlink> Aguilar noted. <paragraph> In the wake of the GOP's failure to attract the Latino vote in the 2012 election, Hannity on Thursday said the United States needs to “get rid of the immigration issue altogether.”  <hyperlink> <paragraph> “I think you control the border first,   <hyperlink> he said.  You create a pathway for those people that are here — you don’t say you’ve got to go home. And that is a position that I’ve evolved on. Because, you know what, it’s got to be resolved. 
Blitzer cameos in new Bond film 'Skyfall' | The name’s Blitzer. Wolf Blitzer. <paragraph> If you catch a screening of the new James Bond movie “Skyfall” this weekend, you’ll spot the CNN anchor making a brief cameo appearance early on in the film. Blitzer plays himself and delivers a crucial news report that spurs Bond into action on behalf of her Majesty's secret service. It's a small role, but crucial to driving the plot. <paragraph> “Daniel Craig, James Bond and Wolf Blitzer,” Blitzer said on Thursday’s show about his performance. “You’ll have to see it.” <paragraph> Blitzer asked his viewers to tweet him once they’d seen the film. <paragraph> “This acting thing, maybe I’ve got some potential,” he added. “You never know.  <paragraph> He’s not the only CNN anchor with a movie out this month: Piers Morgan guests in the Denzel Washington movie “Flight,” which opened last Friday. Like Blitzer, the “Piers Morgan Tonight” anchor plays himself. Morgan tweeted on Thursday <hyperlink>about what he dubbed CNN’s “thespian war.” <paragraph> “So, I'm in the new Denzel movie #Flight and @wolfblitzer 's in the new Bond movie #Skyfall - both out this week. This is... #CNNthespianwar,” Morgan wrote. <paragraph> CNN did not have any additional comment.
Murdoch apologizes to ADL for 'Jewish owned press' tweet | Media mogul Rupert Murdoch apologized to the Anti-Defamation League in a phone call and follow-up letter for his controversial tweet blasting the “Jewish owned press” for their “anti-Israel” coverage. <paragraph>  I feel very strongly about the righteousness of Israeli's cause, particularly when its citizens are under missile attack,” Murdoch wrote in his letter. “So I do get very upset when I see coverage that I feel is unfair and biased towards Israel.  But I should have stuck to the substance of the issue and not bring in irrelevant and incorrect ethnic matters.  <paragraph> The News Corp. CEO called his tweet “awkward and inappropriate” in the letter and phone call, the press release stated. <hyperlink>  <paragraph> ADL national director Abraham Foxman on Monday said the group accepted Murdoch’s apology. <paragraph> “After speaking with Mr. Murdoch, it is clear that he deeply regretted posting his remark on Twitter and understands how his reference to ‘Jewish owned media’ could play into the age-old anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about ‘Jewish control’ of the news media,” Foxman said in a statement. “We appreciate his effort to apologize, and to make clear that his remarks were an attempt to defend Israel made at a time when the Jewish state is under direct assault, and were not intended to hurt or to offend.” <paragraph> In 2010, Murdoch was presented with the ADL International Leadership Award. <hyperlink> Murdoch on Sunday offered a kind of apology  <hyperlink> for his original comment <hyperlink>  — “Why Is Jewish owned press so consistently anti- Israel in every crisis?” — writing on Twitter that “’,Jewish owned press’ have been sternly criticised, suggesting link to Jewish reporters. Don't see this, but apologise unreservedly.”
Pew: Fox, MSNBC more extreme in campaign's last week | Fox News and MSNBC became even more extreme in their coverage of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney during the final days of the 2012 campaign, according to a new study out Monday. <paragraph> On MSNBC, negative coverage of Romney jumped from 57 percent for most of October to 68 percent from Oct. 29 to Nov. 5, while Fox News’s negative coverage of Obama increased from 47 percent to 56 percent in the last week, the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism survey found.  <hyperlink>  <paragraph> Meanwhile, MSNBC’s positive coverage of Obama grew from 33 percent to 51 percent during that last week and Fox News’s favorable Romney coverage increased from 34 percent of segments to 42 percent. <paragraph> Overall, the study found that Obama enjoyed a major surge in positive coverage during the last week of his campaign, with positive stories outnumbering negative ones by 10 points, or 29 percent to 19 percent. Romney’s final week with the press was marked by more negative stories than positive, 33 percent to 16 percent. <paragraph> The study analyzed 660 stories from 49 outlets from Oct. 22 through Nov.5.

NYT's Carr puts the spotlight on Washington Post publisher | The New York Times’ David Carr on Sunday hammered Washington Post publisher Katharine Weymouth for her handling of the switch from Marcus Brauchli as executive editor to Martin Baron. <paragraph> “It is an inopportune time for The Post to stumble. Ms. Weymouth’s move is akin to switching drivers just as the car is sputtering to a stop,” Carr wrote in his Sunday column.  <hyperlink>  “Print, and more ominously, digital advertising revenue is in decline, circulation is in a dive and the newspaper’s ‘for and about Washington’ editorial strategy has left employees underwhelmed. Now Ms. Weymouth seems to be upending the loyalty and accountability that has been a hallmark of her family’s ownership of the newspaper.” Carr wrote that although Weymouth may have made a good decision by selecting Baron, “four years into her tenure at the top, she still seems to be struggling to get a grasp on a huge job at a company whose journalism has at times altered the course of a nation.” <paragraph> “Brauchli may not have been the perfect person to lead the newsroom in entropic times, but the way the switch was made raised questions about Ms. Weymouth’s maturity and steadfastness as an operational leader,” Carr wrote. <paragraph> Still, he wrote, The Post remains “an important player.” <paragraph> “It is not what it once was, but it isn’t nothing either. Ms. Weymouth’s continued misfires, along with the lack of success in generating new revenue, however, have left the newspaper staring down the gun barrel of deep cuts and a business model in free fall,” he wrote. <paragraph> Weymouth declined to comment for the piece, Carr noted. 
Tina Brown: 'The Zeitgeist was against Newsweek' | When Tina Brown looks back on her decision to take over Newsweek, “it just seems completely insane, actually,” she told New York Magazine. <paragraph> In a wide-ranging interview appearing in the Nov. 26 issue  <hyperlink> ,  Brown spoke about everything from the future of newsweeklies to who she supported in the 2012 election — “you know who I voted for” — to her friendship with The Huffington Post’s Arianna Huffington — “we shared some of the same boyfriends.” As for her start at Newsweek, Brown told Michael Kinsley she felt it was a “romantic gamble that there was still life to be had for” the newsweekly.  <paragraph> “We felt that for the Daily Beast—such a frisky digital brand—to have a print platform as well would be great,” the ex-Vanity Fair, ex-New Yorker, ex-Talk editor said. “And, actually, that proved to be true. But every piece of the Zeitgeist was against Newsweek, combined with an unfixable infrastructure and a set of challenges that really would have required five years in an up economy to solve.” <paragraph>  And the future is a metered-access model, she said, with Newsweek charging readers for every fourth or fifth piece. Other magazines will soon follow Newsweek and move online, Brown, who announced in October that Newsweek would cease publishing  <hyperlink> at the end of this year and move to an all-digital format, predicted.  <paragraph>  “I think a lot of magazines are going to have to go online. There will be magazines, but a lot of magazines are going to decide that with basic, inherent costs, the fact that advertisers want to now be in digital, combined with the reading habits of all of us—they’ll decide that print doesn’t make any sense,” Brown said. <paragraph> And her decision to take on Newsweek  just seems completely insane  to her now, she said. <paragraph> “Within the first few months, one of the partners dies—before we’d even really gotten the office straight. I came into a situation where pretty much every senior member of management had departed,” she noted. <paragraph> Not to mention that the magazine cost $42 million to print even before any staff salaries, she said. <paragraph> “That was the thing,” Brown said. “We just looked at it in the spring, and everything, every trend, suggested this was never going to change. It’s not like you felt it was a temporary advertising situation.” And while she had envisioned that Newsweek could take after European newsmagazines with their “energetic, high-low approach to news,” Newsweek’s poor advertising sales made that impossible, Brown said.  There’s something about the way a magazine looks and feels when it doesn’t have advertising that is unbelievably disappointing, both as an editor and as a writer,” she said. <paragraph> Brown also reflected on the very different world of Newsweek in its heyday — “when I looked at the document of sale, it was like the vestiges of the great galleon it had been. It was like that wreck of the Titanic, in the James Cameron film” — but said the magazine still has a “great deal of access and power.” <paragraph> “And I think we’ve done a very good magazine,” she told Kinsley. “I don’t know whether you’ve been reading it—probably not—but it’s very good. There was a lot of talent here. But it’s like having a refrigerator on each foot—to have this carapace of the print magazine and all its problems, and all its legacy of unsolved issues. Once we shed that, we’ll just be able to focus on the content. I find that very liberating, personally. I think many of the staff do, too.” <paragraph> In the interview, Brown also defended herself against various accusations Kinsley posed — that she only cares about “buzz,” hasn’t made money for any of the publications she has run and that her only role is paying lots of money to big-name writers. <paragraph> Kinsley also offered an “observation” that “Tina has a thing for older men. And older men have a thing for Tina.” “Do you feel you have a special connection with older men?” he asked. <paragraph> “I certainly feel I have a special connection with the one I’m married to,” she said, as Kinsley jumped in to press her again on his “observation.” <paragraph> “You go to war with the army you have,” Brown replied. “Please. Let’s not talk about me having things for Si Newhouse and Harvey Weinstein. I enjoyed working for both of them, even Harvey.” <paragraph> The interview ended with a look four years into the future, to the 2016 election: Brown said she’d throw her full support behind Hillary Clinton. <paragraph> “Citizen Tina—thanks for that—would hike across America for Hillary. I’ve seen her up close in action in our Women in the World events, and she’s so unbelievably compelling. I want her to get her two years off, cut her hair again, freshen up those old pantsuits, and hit the trail running,” Brown said.   
Post ombudsman on Brauchli and Baron | Washington Post ombudsman Patrick Pexton on Friday reflected on the end of Marcus Brauchli's reign as executive editor and the future of the paper under Martin Baron. <paragraph> Pexton wrote in his column,  A new era — and editor — for The Post  <hyperlink> ,  that Brauchli had the  misfortune  of leading the Post during the last four years when  there has been no harder time to lead a major national or metropolitan newspaper.  <paragraph>  What did Brauchli accomplish, and where does his departure leave the newsroom, which will now go through more turmoil and perhaps more cuts?  Pexton asked.  And what will the change mean for readers and for The Post, a publication important to the functioning of American democracy?  <paragraph> Brauchli's  most important legacy,  Pexton wrote, is that he  he and his team brought The Post fully into the digital era.  <paragraph> He has an  understated style of leadership that many liked,  but Pexton said reporters and editors told him they wanted  more engagement  and a newsroom leader who could  drive the newsroom, pushing the staff to perform on big news stories, a harder-hitting journalist — not in an overbearing sense but in a determined, fire-in-the-belly, newshound kind of way.  <paragraph> That wasn't the only newsroom complaint Pexton heard. The Post's Local staff  felt neglected until around the last year of Brauchli's tenure,  many in the newsroom thought the Style section  was allowed to lose its focus and distinctive voice  and some Post veterans said Brauchli  never really connected or reached out to them, nor tapped their institutional knowledge.  <paragraph>   Now the newsroom is worried about more upheaval, just when many reporters and editors felt things were settling down. They worry about their jobs and whether Baron, who downsized the Globe’s newsroom, is being brought in to do more of the same,  he wrote. <paragraph>  Post publisher Katharine Weymouth told Pexton she does not intend for any “change in mission and no draconian cuts.” <paragraph>  The key point for The Post, for newcomer Baron and for the newsroom to remember at this difficult time is that the mission of this paper, even amid all the technological and financial challenges, is larger than any individual. That mission must be preserved,  Pexton wrote.  The Post’s brand, identity and purpose is to keep governments — national and local — honest and to point out when they’re not, to chronicle our age and the people in the capital region who define it, to tell a good sports story and to have some fun doing all of the above.  
NYT CEO faces more scrutiny from NYT | A legal letter about the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal is raising more questions about New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson’s knowledge of the spiked investigation into the BBC host, the Times reported Friday  <hyperlink>  <paragraph> . The Times’ Matthew Purdy wrote that in September, lawyers who represented Thompson and another executive “threatened to sue The Sunday Times in London” over a proposed article about the spiking of the “Newsnight” investigation into Savile. <paragraph> An aide told the Times that although Thompson authorized the letter, he was not aware of what the note detailed. Purdy wrote “interviews show that the letter included a summary of the alleged abuse, including the allegation that some abuse might have occurred at the BBC.” It also threatened “defamation proceedings.” <paragraph> “It’s not clear if he was shown it, but he doesn’t remember reading it,” the aide told the Times. <paragraph> The Sunday Times magazine article never ran, Purdy noted. Thompson did not comment to the Times for the article. <paragraph> Thompson, the former BBC director general who started his new job at the Times on Monday,has said he was not involved in killing the Savile investigation <hyperlink> . He has said he was not briefed on the investigation and had no knowledge of it being dropped, although he later said a reporter briefly informed him of it in December 2011. <paragraph> “There were other moments during Mr. Thompson’s final months at the BBC — involving brief conversations and articles appearing in London news media — when he might have picked up on the gravity of the Savile case,  Purdy wrote.  But the letter is different because it shows Mr. Thompson was involved in an aggressive action to challenge an article about the case that was likely to reflect poorly on the BBC and on him. 
Kristol: 'Mistake' to fight over Bush tax cuts | The Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol on Monday said it would be a “mistake” if Republicans pick a fight on the expiring Bush tax cuts and added that the party needs to “get it out of the way so we can fight about tax reform.” <paragraph> “It’s President Obama’s proposal, he ran on it, let him implement it. If things slow down, it’s his fault. And that’s fine with me, and I hope things don’t slow down because I hope we get real tax reform in 2013,” Kristol said Monday night on Fox News’s “Special Report” with Bret Baier. “But I just think picking the fight right now on the expiring Bush tax cuts is a mistake.” <paragraph> Kristol said he hopes the Republican Party caves on this now so “we can fight about the big deal that has to happen next year.” <paragraph>  “The Bush tax rates expire on Dec. 31,” he said. “Rates are going up for everyone, if nothing happens. If you think Republicans can win a showdown on preserving all the current Bush tax rates against a president who was just re-elected and gained seats in the Senate and House on just raising rates on millionaires, well, good luck. I prefer this as a policy outcome. I don’t think it’s winnable. I think at the end, Republicans will cave.” <paragraph>  The Weekly Standard editor noted that the four fastest years of economic growth in the last 30 years were under Ronald Reagan when the top marginal tax rate was 50 percent. <paragraph>  “Honestly, 35 to 39 percent, by itself, is not going to cripple the economy,” Kristol added. <paragraph>  Kristol first expressed his support of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire on Sunday. <paragraph>   The leadership of the Republican Party and the leadership of the conservative movement has to pull back, let people float new ideas. Let's have a serious debate,  Kristol said on  Fox News Sunday <hyperlink> .   Don't scream and yell if one person says 'You know what? It won't kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires.' It really won't, I don't think.  <paragraph>   I don't really understand why Republicans don't take Obama's offer to freeze taxes for everyone below $250,000, make it $500,000, make it $1 million,  Kristol added on Sunday.  Really? The Republican Party is going to fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires, half of whom voted Democratic and half of whom live in Hollywood?  
What's the quickest way to Canada? | <video> It’s the age-old election threat: I’ll move to Canada if my candidate loses. <paragraph> Well, on Wednesday morning, FOX23’s traffic reporter Jeff Brucculeri made that promise a little easier for Tulsa residents to fulfill by offering viewers the best route to get to our northern neighbors. <paragraph> “We had some folks make a special request. I know a lot people said that if their candidate lost the election, they’d be moving to Canada — not sure why, but that was some of the folks’ promises out there. So let me give you the quickest and direct-est route to Canada from Tulsa,” he said during the “Beat The Traffic” segment on Tulsa, Oklahoma's FOX23. <paragraph> Brucculeri recommended taking Highway 75 northbound, up through Kansas. “When you get into Omaha, watch for that junction for Interstate 29, because then you want to take I-29,” he said. “Literally, I-29 will go to the Canadian border.” <paragraph> The newsroom erupted with laughter off-screen, but Brucculeri soldiered on with his directions. <paragraph> “They’re laughing at me. Now, when you get to Canada — this is serious stuff,” he said. “When you get to Canada, you’re going to hit the border here, make sure you got either your card or your passport, okay, to get into Canada, now. Then you’re going to get back on what is known as Highway 75 in Canada, or it’s actually the Lord Selkirk Highway. If you’re moving to Canada, you’re going to need to know this. Lord Selkirk Highway, okay?
