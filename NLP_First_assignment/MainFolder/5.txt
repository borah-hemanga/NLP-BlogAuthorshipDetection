Obama hopes fade in Nebraska |     <paragraph>   A new Omaha World-Herald poll suggests that President Barack Obama’s chances of a repeat win in Nebraska are fading.    <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    According to the survey, conducted Oct. 23-25, Mitt Romney leads Obama 49 percent to 44 percent in the Omaha-based 2nd District, and a comfortable 52 percent to 38 percent margin statewide. The last time the poll was in the field, in late September, the race was deadlocked at 44 percent in the 2nd District. <paragraph>   The Omaha-based district has been     <hyperlink>    closely watched this year after it produced one of the biggest surprises of 2008 by voting narrowly for Obama. Back then, the Obama campaign captured one of the conservative state’s five electoral votes by taking advantage of Nebraska’s unusual electoral vote allocation — it’s one of just two states  the other is Maine  that awards its electoral votes by congressional district, rather than to the overall state winner.    <paragraph>   In his post-election book, campaign manager David Plouffe labeled the Nebraska district “my personal favorite target.”
Calif. props price tag: $351 million | <paragraph>   <picture>    <paragraph>   While there’s no action at the presidential level in California, where President Barack Obama is poised to win by a comfortable margin, the nation’s largest state is still weathering an avalanche of campaign spending.    <paragraph>   The main driver? The 11 statewide ballot propositions.    <paragraph>   A new     <hyperlink>    MapLight analysis of campaign finance data through Oct. 25 reports that $351 million has been raised by the campaigns for and against the ballot measures.    <paragraph>   The bulk of that staggering total is in just three propositions: two measures that raise taxes  Propositions 30 and 38  and Proposition 32, which would ban unions and corporations from using automatic paycheck deductions to raise money for political purposes.    <paragraph>   At least $128 million has been raised for Prop 32, powered by $68.8 million in pro-labor money.    <paragraph>   The MapLight research reveals some fascinating nuggets, including the extent to which just a few mega-donors and special interests are     <hyperlink>    bankrolling the measures. But what’s equally interesting about the totals is that they serve as a reminder of the exorbitant costs of campaigning in California.    <paragraph>   The state hasn’t been competitive at the presidential level for a quarter-century but if it was, given the price tag of competing there, it would have a dramatic effect on the business of running for president, forcing a wholesale rethinking of strategy, tactics and fundraising practices.
Fla. insiders: Romney will win state  |    <paragraph>   Florida’s top politicos believe by an overwhelming margin that Mitt Romney will carry the state on Election Day.    <paragraph>   According to the latest     <hyperlink>    Tampa Bay Times survey of 120 of Florida’s top political insiders, 73 percent expect Romney will win Florida, compared to just 27 percent who think President Barack Obama will win the state a second time.    <paragraph>   The list of 120 insiders – consultants, lobbyists, fundraisers, political scientists, etc. -- is a little top heavy with Republicans: it’s made up of 65 Republicans, 48 Democrats and 7 independents or minor party types.    <paragraph>   But even among Democrats, 60 percent think Romney will carry Florida. Republicans are more certain: 95 percent believe Romney will win the state’s 29 electoral votes.    <paragraph>   While much of the October polling validates the notion that Romney has the edge in the nation’s largest swing state, all signs point to a very tight finish. At the moment, the RealClearPolitics polling average spread between the candidates is 1.8 percentage points.
NRCC still spending in Rhode Island. Really. |     <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Here’s a headline you don’t expect to see in heavily Democratic Rhode Island, 11 days out from Election Day: “National GOP to spend $280K on final TV push to oust Cicilline.”   <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    Ted Nesi’s report for WPRI: “Republicans have said for weeks they don’t believe the hype that Democratic Congressman David Cicilline is pulling away from GOP challenger Brendan Doherty. Now they’re putting their money where their mouths are. <paragraph>   The National Republican Congressional Committee confirmed Friday it will spend $280,000 on a final round of television commercials to air during the closing week of Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District race, enough to buy 1,000 gross rating points. The ads will air Oct. 30 to Nov. 6.”    <paragraph>   Given the state and the district’s Democratic orientation, the national GOP has typically checked out of Little Rhody by this time of year — if they paid attention at all. But the NRCC’s financial commitment at this late stage is a sign that Cicilline is an incumbent who remains in the danger zone.    <paragraph>   Cicilline, a freshman whose first term has been dogged by controversy surrounding statements he made about the fiscal health of Providence before he left the mayor’s office for Washington, is one of two New England Democrats facing uphill reelection challenges this year — the other is Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney.    <paragraph>   Suffice it to say, if Democrats aren’t able to hold House seats in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in a presidential election year, then there isn’t much hope of capturing a majority.    <paragraph>   UPDATE: Not to be outdone, the DCCC is     <hyperlink>    countering with a $315,000 ad buy for Cicilline,  placed just hours after the National Republican Congressional Committee revealed it will spend $280,000 on a final round of commercials to help Doherty. 
Reid: A one-man Romney wrecking crew |  <paragraph>   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid returned to his highly stylized Mitt Romney-bashing Monday in Nevada.  <paragraph>   While Reid’s attacks on Romney have been an ongoing pursuit, the stinging, personal nature of the criticism continues to stand out. Much of it is specific to Romney’s character — among other things, Reid has questioned the GOP nominee’s faith and insinuated he’s a tax cheat. It’s a level of disparagement that reaches beyond standard partisan character attacks, marked by especially blunt rhetoric for a Senate majority leader.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    the Las Vegas Sun report: “ Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called himself a “one-man wrecking crew” on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s refusal to release his tax returns and warned of “17 angry old white men” spending vast sums on political advertising as he tried to rouse Carson City to vote for Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley and President Barack Obama.    <paragraph>   Reid told a packed room in Carson City on Monday that Romney was a “plastic man running for president who changes his position every chance he gets. He isn’t someone who should represent this country.” ”    <paragraph>   Reid and Romney’s shared Mormon faith makes the Nevada senator's scorched-earth approach all the more fascinating. At a time that’s being called  the Mormon moment  because of the historic nature of Romney’s candidacy — he’s the first Mormon major party nominee — and at a time when the former Massachusetts governor has overwhelming support among fellow members of the LDS Church, the nation’s other top Mormon in public life ranks as one of Romney’s harshest detractors.    <paragraph>   One byproduct of the strained relationship is that it expresses the spectrum of LDS political thinking to a nation that’s unfamiliar with it. But it also raises questions about     <hyperlink>    what kind of relationship the two could ever hope to have if Romney were to be elected president.
Linda McMahon's presidential play |  <paragraph>   <video>    <paragraph>   Back in 2010, President Obama dismissed Republican Linda McMahon’s wealth and her background as a pro wrestling executive. The choice between McMahon and Democrat Richard Blumenthal in the open Connecticut Senate race that year, he said, was a “no-brainer.”    <paragraph>   Nevertheless, McMahon, who is running again for Senate this year, is up with a spot urging voters to split their tickets and cast votes for her and the president.    <paragraph>   It’s a matter of political necessity. While Obama isn’t likely to win Connecticut by the same margin as in 2008, when he won 61 percent to John McCain’s 38 percent, he still leads Mitt Romney there by double digits in the polls. That’s a considerable top-of-the-ticket drag for a candidate like McMahon who’s locked in a tight race with Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy.    <paragraph>   And for blue state Obama voters who simply can’t envision themselves casting a GOP vote, McMahon’s ad  titled “Independent”  notes they can support on her on the Independent line — the other ballot line she qualified for.    <paragraph>   The second ballot line could end up making the difference in a razor-thin race. In 2010, the votes Gov. Dannel Malloy won on the Working Families party line put him over the top against Republican Tom Foley.
Dems hold smaller Nevada edge than '08 |    <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Democrats will go into Election Day with a 90,000 voter registration advantage in Nevada, a smaller edge than in 2008 when Barack Obama carried the state.    <paragraph>   At the     <hyperlink>    close of voter registration this week in the Mountain West swing state, there were 526,986 Democrats and 436,799 Republicans — a difference of 90,187 active voters.    <paragraph>   In 2008, at the close of registration, Democrats held a statewide advantage of 100,723 voters.    <paragraph>   While the statewide gap between the parties has closed slightly since 2008 — a year when Democratic registration surged in Nevada and Obama carried the state by 121,000 votes — the real growth was among independents. The number of nonpartisan registrations across the state grew by 36,000 since 2008.    <paragraph>   That spike in independents is a prominent feature of the 2012 swing state map.    <paragraph>   According to     <hyperlink>    an August report from the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina posted double-digit percentage gains in the number of independent voters since the last presidential election.
Gay marriage polling uncertain | <paragraph>   A new poll in Washington state shows a comfortable lead for R-74, a referendum that would approve same-sex marriage.    <paragraph>   Fifty-four percent of voters support the ballot measure, according to a     <hyperlink>    KCTS 9 Washington Poll released Thursday, compared with 38 percent who oppose it.    <paragraph>   Washington is one of four Democratic-oriented states that will be voting on same-sex marriage measures on Election Day — Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota are the others — and in each of them, polling suggests that November could provide a breakthrough victory on an issue that has never passed on a statewide ballot.    <paragraph>   In Maryland, for example,    <hyperlink>    a Washington Post poll released Thursday reported voters favor upholding the state’s gay marriage law, 52 percent to 43 percent.    <paragraph>   There’s just one problem. In the past, polling surrounding same-sex marriage measures has been highly unreliable — voters have not always been truthful with pollsters about their true voting preference.    <paragraph>   As a result, the University of Washington, which conducted the KCTS 9 poll, also offered adjusted data to account for “social desirability bias” — the tendency of voters to misrepresent their true feelings on sensitive issues in an attempt to present themselves in a way that will seem favorable to others.    <paragraph>   With the adjusted vote estimate, the results were a lot closer — 53 percent in support of the measure and 47 percent in opposition.    <paragraph>   That’s a 9-point swing in opposition, a dramatically higher percentage than in the unadjusted results and one that should worry marriage equality advocates since the polling spread in Maine, Maryland and Minnesota is under 10 points.
Rendell: Casey hasn't run a campaign |   <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   As Democrats nervously eye the narrowing polls in Pennsylvania’s Senate race, reliably off-message former Gov. Ed Rendell offers a frank assessment of why Republican Tom Smith has closed the gap with Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr.    <paragraph>   From the     <hyperlink>    Times-Tribune in Scranton: “ “Casey? He hasn’t run a campaign. He’s run one ad, a stupid tea party ad,” Mr. Rendell said. “The tea party ad isn’t bad, but that’s all they’ve run. They’ve run a non-campaign up until now, and Smith has put a lot of money into the campaign. … You start spending money, that’ll change.” ”    <paragraph>   The race, which hasn’t been viewed as a top-tier contest, has undoubtedly gotten closer in the homestretch as Smith has poured millions into TV spots hammering the first-term incumbent. While Casey has led in every public poll taken this year — and at least two recent polls give him a double-digit edge — a handful of other surveys over the past two weeks put his advantage at 4 points or less.    <paragraph>   The Casey camp surely won’t appreciate Rendell’s analysis — delivered to the senator’s hometown paper — but it’s not surprising, given the long history the two pols share.    <paragraph>   Casey’s father defeated Rendell in the 1986 Democratic primary for governor; in 2002, Rendell returned to defeat the junior Casey in a bitter Democratic gubernatorial primary.    <paragraph>   By 2006, the two Democrats had established a working relationship: Rendell backed Casey in the 2006 Senate race. But two years later, they were on opposite sides again as Casey backed Barack Obama in the presidential primary and Rendell emerged as one of Hillary Clinton’s strongest supporters. <paragraph>   UPDATE: It's worth noting that, despite the criticism, Rendell still thinks Casey will win — and run ahead of the president.  If Obama ends up winning the state by 6 or 7  points ,  it's almost impossible for Smith to win. Without question,  Rendell said in the same interview.  I think, in the end, Casey is going to run ahead of Obama. If Obama wins by 5, Casey wins by 7 or 8. 
The final days of Laura Richardson |     <paragraph>       <picture>  <paragraph>   The House election homestretch always seems to feature one member of Congress who essentially gives up before Election Day, and this cycle that member appears to be California Democratic Rep. Laura Richardson.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    POLITICO’s Jessica Meyers: “ Richardson raised $7,000 from July through September — a figure smaller than the $9,000 she loaned her own campaign and the roughly $8,000 she was credited for in refunds and canceled checks to her lawyers.    <paragraph>   If the Democratic Transportation and Infrastructure Committee member beats fellow Democratic incumbent Janice Hahn in November, Richardson will have lifted more political baggage across the finish line than any other candidate this election cycle.   <paragraph>   Her campaign did not respond to requests for comment.”    <paragraph>   By raising just $7,000 in the latest quarter — a paltry sum for a member of Congress, let alone one who is engaged in a tough  incumbent vs. incumbent matchup — Richardson appears to have concluded some time ago that there’s no viable path to reelection.    <paragraph>   The congresswoman finished 20 percentage points behind Hahn in California's June  top-two  primary, a disheartening sign since they were the only two candidates running. The result offered little hope that Richardson could close the gap by November.    <paragraph>   Redistricting-related changes to her seat and the congresswoman’s ethics issues were hard enough to overcome, but without any cash — Richardson had just $68,000 cash on hand at the end of September — it’s nearly impossible.
Team Mitt dumps dirt on Santorum |  <paragraph>   Mitt Romney's campaign excels in the dark art of opposition research. If you don't believe me, just ask any top operative working for the former Massachusetts governor. He or she will gladly plant a story confirming their tactical genius with the nearest New York Times reporter. But over the past 24 hours, Team Romney has instead focused on hammering Rick Santorum with a slew of well-placed stories.   <paragraph>   A number of Rick's past interviews involving contraception have magically begun to resurface and are racing across the Internet after being picked up by the     <hyperlink>    Washington Post and     <hyperlink>    Time. Chances are good the content of those conversations will help opponents in their efforts to paint Santorum as an extremist on social issues.   <paragraph>   So what's the problem? Well, for starters, the GOP front-runner declared in a 2006 interview with     <hyperlink>    CN8 that contraception was  harmful to women  and  harmful to society.  That position is so obviously outside the mainstream of American culture that I suspect it will even lose him votes in Southern primaries next month.    <paragraph>   When the CN8 interview was conducted six years ago, Rick Santorum assured the interviewer that he would not allow his private beliefs on contraception to conflict with public policy. But that public-private divide was nowhere to be found when he gave an    <hyperlink>    interview to a Christian website in October 2011  start watching 17:45 in .    <paragraph>   In the interview posted on Time's website, Santorum warned that contraceptives were dangerous to women and declared that  it is not OK  to use birth control. The current GOP front-runner went on to describe contraceptives as a license to engage in immoral acts and to  do whatever you want to do without having any responsibility that goes with that.     <paragraph>   These newly discovered interviews damage Rick Santorum's campaign in the same way President Obama's HHS ruling caused a temporary setback to the White House last week. That's because both the Obama and Santorum story lines fed into an existing narrative that concerns independent voters.    <paragraph>   All those who feared that Barack Obama was a big government liberal took no comfort from his showdown with a unified Catholic Church. Their claim that Washington was infringing on their religious liberties was a crisis in the making. But President Obama's ability to form an alliance with a group of progressive Catholics late in the week helped neutralize that issue for the White House. <paragraph>   Those who fear that Rick Santorum is an extremist on social issues will not have their fears assuaged by these two interviews. As Time's Michael Scherer points out in his post, 99% of American women have used contraceptives at one time in their life. And late this afternoon, women's groups began     <hyperlink>    attacking Santorum for statements made in these two interviews.    <paragraph>   Like President Obama, Mr. Santorum better put this contraceptive crisis behind him soon or Mitt Romney will avoid the Michigan Meltdown that many were predicting just this morning.
The truth about entitlement spending | <paragraph>   If you want to know why Republicans and Democrats can't make progress on long-term deficit reduction, take a look at the segment below from Morning Joe. In our roundtable discussion, my good friend Jeffrey Sachs  I need to underline that point before you actually watch the segment  claims that entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid will not cause the national debt to balloon over the next generation.   <paragraph>   Despite my great respect for Dr. Sachs, the Columbia professor's math doesn't seem to add up. <paragraph>   Financier and former Obama Car Czar Steve Rattner came to play today with handy charts that show entitlement spending devouring 40% of federal spending in 2012. Within the decade, that number expands to 54%, and goes much higher in the out years. Steve also described a crowding out of federal investment in discretionary programs like education, R&D and infrastructure because of an ever-growing entitlement system fueled by an aging population and rising health care costs.  <paragraph>   Dr. Sachs did admit that entitlement spending was on a sharp upward trajectory but was unwilling to embrace the type of reforms that I believe will prevent the collapse of Medicare in the future.  <paragraph>   But progressives are not alone in their collective state of denial regarding Medicare. In one of the most depressing poll results registered over the past few years, self-described Tea Party members were surveyed last spring     <hyperlink>    in a Marist poll and asked if they supported Medicare spending reforms. A pathetic 70% said  no,  proving once again that when it comes to entitlement programs, some Americans just don't want to hear the truth.   <paragraph>   But the truth is that Medicare and Medicaid are the biggest drivers of America's national debt over the next generation. And that is not a matter of ideology. That is a matter of math. <video>
Crunch time for Romney | <paragraph>   In case you missed the show today, please see the video below of our discussion regarding the current state of the GOP race. The Michigan primary is exactly two weeks away, and several new polls show it is officially crunch time for the Romney campaign. What seemed only weeks ago to be a foregone conclusion for the former Massachusetts governor is shaping up to be an epic battle.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    American Research Group - Santorum with a 7 point lead  <hyperlink>    Public Policy Polling - Santorum with a 15 point lead     <paragraph>   <video>
Statement by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski regarding Pat Buchanan |  <paragraph>    Everyone at Morning Joe considers     <hyperlink>    Pat Buchanan to be a friend and a member of the family. Even though we strongly disagree with the contents of Pat's latest book, Mika and I believe those differences should have been debated in public. An open dialogue with     <hyperlink>    Morning Joe regulars like Al Sharpton and Harold Ford, Jr. could have developed into an important debate on the future of race relations in America.  <paragraph>   Because we believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant, Mika and I strongly disagree with this     <hyperlink>    outcome. We understand that the parting was amicable. Still, we will miss Pat. 
Tell Scarborough: Where do you stand on Afghanistan? | <paragraph>   With Afghanistan on the front pages of America's papers this past weekend, Morning Joe     <hyperlink>    started the week discussing the latest tragedies from that war-torn country and the need to bring our troops home. Watch the discussion below and let me know what you think by emailing me at     <hyperlink>    joeblog@politico.com or sending your thoughts via Twitter      <hyperlink>    @joenbc .  <paragraph>   <video>
Doubts about Akin's cause | <paragraph>   Todd Akin says he's staying in the race because  there is a cause here.     <paragraph>   Perhaps he is right. Perhaps there is a cause worth risking a Republican Senate, that is worth risking two more years with Harry Reid as Majority Leader, that is worth damaging the Republican brand and is worth casting a dark shadow over Mitt Romney's convention next week.    <paragraph>   But if there is a cause worthy of losing the U.S. Senate and damaging Romney and Ryan's chances against Barack Obama, I sure don't see it.  <paragraph>   I look forward to Congressman Akin's explanation.
Subtlety at the Times this holy week |    <paragraph>       <picture>   <paragraph>   You have to give the New York Times editors credit. With 2 billion Christians worldwide to choose from, they found a small group of pilgrims in Spain looking like exaggerated versions of Ku Klux Klan members to place on their front page on this Holy Weekend. It would be hard to imagine the Times editors finding  a group of worshipping Christians that would appear more ghoulish to Times readers than the image chosen.    <paragraph>   Very subtle.
My new POLITICO blog, all I ever needed | <paragraph>   Thanks so much for taking a look at my Politico blog. <paragraph>   Like Navin R. Johnson seeing his name in the phone book for the first time, I feel like this is the lucky break I've been waiting for all my life. My blog will delight you and your extended family with stories of European futbol matches that end in 0-0 ties, underground bands for whom neither you nor your friends have ever heard, and inspiring stories regaling the glories of my time in Congress 47 years ago.   <paragraph>   I will also do my best to let you know what's really happening behind the scenes in Congress, the White House and in the media world. I'll also write about the things that really matter the most to me -- like my ashtray, and these matches, and the remote control, and the paddle ball... and this lamp. That's all I need, is this lamp....and this blog.   <paragraph>   Best, Joe

Scarborough: Romney not a conservative  VIDEO  |     <paragraph>   <video>
Lawsuit filed for withheld Fast and Furious documents |  <paragraph>  A conservative watchdog group has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to force disclosure of records that President Barack Obama has ordered withheld from the Congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious.  <paragraph>  Judicial Watch filed the suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington after a Freedom of Information Act request the group submitted in June was denied by the Justice Department. The agency has not acted on an administrative appeal the group filed last month, the complaint says.  <paragraph>  The FOIA suit opens up a second legal front in the effort to obtain the records, which pertain to the federal government's response to Congressional and media inquiries into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operation that allegedly allowed about 2,000 weapons to flow from legal U.S. gun dealers to Mexican drug cartels.  <paragraph>  Last month, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee   <hyperlink> filed its own lawsuit to obtain the records.  <paragraph>  A Justice Department spokesman had no comment on the new case. However, DOJ officials have noted in the past that the records in dispute don't relate directly to the ATF operation, but rather to how the executive branch responded to some of the fallout from it.  <paragraph>  It's unclear whether the Judicial Watch suit will offer a faster or surer path to disclosure of the records than the House action. The legal footing for the House lawsuit to enforce a subpoena against the executive branch is more uncertain than the routine FOIA case Judicial Watch has filed. However, executive branch agencies' right to withhold  deliberative  records in a FOIA case is fairly broad, while the privilege to resist a Congressional investigation may well be narrower.  <paragraph>  Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said Thursday that the group's suit could have some benefit even before or without any actual records becoming public.  <paragraph>   Despite a contempt resolution being passed and the [House] litigation the administration’s refused to disclose exactly what they’re withholding and why,  Fitton said in an interview.  We think a FOIA lawsuit is a simple, direct way to get a handle on what's being withheld and why and provides a good vehicle to challenge withholdings, if they are improper, as we suspect they are. 
White House: anti-Islam film 'truly abhorrent' |  <paragraph>  A top White House official has blasted as  truly abhorrent  the anti-Islam film that appears to have triggered an outpouring of violence against U.S. diplomatic posts in Egypt and Libya.  <paragraph>  Speaking to an international religious freedom conference in Washington on Wednesday, Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough endorsed efforts to create  a world where the dignity of all people — and all faiths — is respected.   <paragraph>  According to his prepared remarks released by the White House, he then added:  This work takes on added urgency given the truly abhorrent video that has offended so many people — Muslims, and non-Muslims alike — in our country and around the world.   <paragraph>  President Barack Obama's criticism earlier Wednesday of the  Innocence of Muslims  film, or film trailer in question, was a bit more reserved.  <paragraph>  In an interview with CBS's  60 Minutes,  Obama said:  This film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that.   <paragraph>  And in a statement in the Rose Garden on Wednesday morning, Obama said in an apparent reference to the video:  We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others.   <paragraph>  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also described the video as  inflammatory.   <paragraph>  GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has not, thus far, criticized the video. He has faulted the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and the Obama administration for statements he that said sympathized with those attacking U.S. embassies because of the film. Romney charged Wednesday that the initial statements were  effectively apologizing for the right of free speech.   <paragraph>  In his remarks Wednesday, McDonough also condemned the violence that apparently led to the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and at least three other Americans in Libya.  <paragraph>  The conference where McDonough spoke was sponsored by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, an organization that has been sharply at odds with the Obama White House over its efforts to force religiously affiliated hospitals and universities to cover birth control costs for their insured employees.  <paragraph>  Later in his remarks, McDonough — an observant Catholic — referred to Obama as a  brother in Christ  and said  faith has been a guiding force in [Obama's] own life. 
Fast and Furious report hearing slips |  <paragraph>  A House hearing about a forthcoming Justice Department report on the Fast and Furious scandal has slipped to next week, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced Monday.  <paragraph>  Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa  R-Calif.  had scheduled the hearing on the yet-to-be-released Office of Inspector General report for Tuesday, Sept. 11. However, the panel delayed the hearing to Wednesday, Sept. 19.  <paragraph>  No reason was given for the delay. However, Inspector Michael Horowitz is expected to testify at the session about his report on the so-called gunwalking tactic and its use by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  <paragraph>  Issa seems to be trying to time the hearing to the release of the report, which will conclude a year-and-a-half long inquiry into Fast and Furious, an operation that may have allowed as many as 2,000 weapons to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels.  <paragraph>  A spokesman for Horowitz declined to comment on the status of the report.  <paragraph>  The House investigation into the operation has prompted President Barack Obama to assert executive privilege to withhold some documents relating to the Justice Department's response to the imbroglio. The oversight panel's lawsuit seeking those documents is pending in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Another death at Guantanamo | <paragraph>  A detainee at the prison for terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay was found dead at the facility on Saturday, the U.S. military said in a statement Monday.  <paragraph>  The statement from the U.S. Southern Command did not say precisely where the prisoner was found, but said he was discovered by guards  conducting routine checks.   <paragraph>   Guards found the detainee unconscious and unresponsive. The guards immediately performed first aid and summoned medical personnel to the scene. The corpsmen provided emergency medical treatment and quickly transported the detainee to Naval Hospital Guantanamo. After extensive lifesaving measures had been performed, the detainee was pronounced dead by a physician,  the SOUTHCOM statement said.  <paragraph>  The statement also offered no information on the prisoner's nationality, age or name. Military officials said the prisoner's identity was  being withheld pending notification of the detainee's government and family.   <paragraph>  In accordance with standard procedures, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is looking into the cause and circumstances of the prisoner's death, the statement said.  <paragraph>  According to the last public count, there were 168 war-on-terror prisoners at Gitmo. The number of live prisoners now appears to stand at 167.
Obama: U.S. seeks 'due process' in drone strikes | <paragraph>  The U.S. Government seeks to accord  due process  to terror suspects targeted for drone strikes, President Barack Obama said in a recent interview. <paragraph>   It's very important for the president and the entire culture of our national security team to continually ask tough questions about, are we doing the right thing, are we abiding by rule of law, are we abiding by due process,  Obama said in an interview with CNN first aired on Monday.  And then set up structures and institutional checks, so that, you know, you avoid any kind of slippery slope into a place where we're not being true to who we are.  <paragraph>  Obama's comments echo   <hyperlink> Attorney General Eric Holder's remarks in a speech in Chicago in March explaining the legal basis the administration asserts for the drone strikes, part of broader programs sometimes referred to as  targeted killing.  However, Holder acknowledged in that speech that the  due process  the administration has employed does not involve an independent review by the courts.  <paragraph>   Due process and judicial process are not one and the same, particularly when it comes to national security,  Holder said then.  The Constitution guarantees due process, it does not guarantee judicial process.   <paragraph>  Critics say the kind of due process Holder and Obama are describing is pretty weak stuff: layers of internal administration review, rather than a more formal process involving a court. One oddity of the current legal situation remains that the U.S. government needs some kind of court-approved warrant to intentionally eavesdrop on the telephone or e-mail of a U.S. citizen suspected of involvement with Al Qaeda, like Anwar Al-Awlaki. However, using a drone, a missile, bomb or military raid to intentionally kill that same person requires no approval from the judicial branch. <paragraph>  Another thing absent here despite the administration's welcome steps towards explaining the scope and legal rationale of the drone programs: transparency. While the various systems for authorizing such strikes have been reported on in  <hyperlink> books like Dan Klaidman's  Kill or Capture  and news stories like   <hyperlink> this one in May in the New York Times, virtually nothing about the mechanics of the process is officially on the record. In addition, it's unclear how if at all the secret authorizing system deals with the issue of whether terrorist suspects, particularly Americans, need to be on notice that the government is seeking them before they're killed in a process that offers no opportunity for surrender on the spot. <paragraph>  The administration has also said that it only uses deadly force where capture is  not feasible,  something president described as limiting the program to  very remote areas [where] it's difficult to capture them.  However, the question of feasibility, sometime referred to as  undue risk  to the U.S. soldiers or operatives who might carry out an operation, seems highly subjective.  <paragraph>  For instance, the operation that targeted Osama bin Laden probably involved  undue risk  to the troops involved, especially when compared with dropping a huge bomb on the house he was living in. The administration seems to be saying it needn't risk an on-the-ground operation when a drone strike will do the trick.  Of course, bombing bin Laden's house would have likely caused civilian casualties, including those of children.   <paragraph>  Given all those thorny issues, one can understand why Obama, a former professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago, told CNN's Jessica Yellin that he  absolutely  struggles with the process.  <paragraph>   By the way, kudos to Yellin for putting the question to Obama in an interview for an election-related CNN documentary. In tweets earlier this week, I credited   <hyperlink> a Cincinnati TV reporter for beating the White House press corps to the punch with the drone-related questions. Turns out Yellin was first and got more out of Obama with sharper questions, though I'm still surprised that it took three years and eight months into Obama's presidency for him to be asked about the subject by a journalist.   <paragraph>  More on the CNN interview   <hyperlink> here on the 44 blog.
Judge: U.S. can't set limits on Guantanamo lawyers |  <paragraph>  Four years after a Democratic convention replete with criticism of then-President George W. Bush for illegally exceeding his executive powers in places like Guantanamo, President Barack Obama finds his administration the target of a tongue-lashing from a federal judge over its handling of lawyers' access to those same war-on-terror prisoners.  <paragraph>  On Thursday afternoon, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth handed a resounding victory to Guantanamo inmates and their attorneys, rejecting a bid by the Obama Administration to unilaterally set the rules under which those lawyers operate.  <paragraph>  In his sharply-worded decision, Lamberth was unsparing in his criticism of the government, blasting officials for  an illegitimate exercise of Executive power.  <paragraph>  A few months ago, the military asserted that it could determine the visitation and communication rules for lawyers without consulting the courts with regard to detainees whose initial challenges to their detention have already been rejected. Justice Department attorneys defended the Pentagon's stance.  <paragraph>  But lawyers for the inmates noted that prisoners have the right to make new bids for freedom. The terror suspects' attorneys also said there was no reason to abrogate the court-ordered rules that have been in place for years.  <paragraph>  In the 32-page opinion  posted  <hyperlink> here , Lamberth unambiguously sided with the prisoners and their counsel.  <paragraph>   In the case of Guantanamo detainees, access to the courts means nothing without access to counsel,  wrote Lamberth, a Reagan appointee.  And it is undisputed that petitioners here have a continuing right to seek habeas relief. It follows that petitioners have an ongoing right to access the courts and, necessarily, to consult with counsel. Therefore, the Government's attempt to supersede the Court's authority is an illegitimate exercise of Executive power.  <paragraph>   The Court, whose duty it is to secure an individual's liberty for unauthorized illegal Executive confinement, cannot now tell a prisoner that he must beg leave of the Executive's grace before the Court will involve itself. This very notion offends the separation of powers principles and our constitutional scheme,  added Lamberth, who is serving at the moment as the chief judge in the district court in Washington.  <paragraph>  A Justice Department spokesman said government lawyers are reviewing the decision and  have no further comment at this time.   <paragraph>  Lamberth's initial ruling said that no prisoner at Guantanamo had ever been  fully tried or convicted of a crime.  That's actually not true. In fact several have pled guilty before military commissions and one, Ahmed Ghailani, was flown to New York and convicted there after a trial. The judge later updated his opinion to say  only a handful have been tried or convicted.   <paragraph>  UPDATE  Friday, 3:45 A.M. : This post has been updated with the change to the judge's opinion.
Appeals court sets arguments on Bradley Manning trial access |  <paragraph>  The military's highest appeals court has announced that it will hear oral arguments next month on a bid to allow the press and public direct access to records relating to the pending court martial of Pvt. Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military reports to WikiLeaks.  <paragraph>  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces will hear the case on October 10, a court clerk said Thursday.  <paragraph>  The appeal is styled as Center for Constitutional Rights v. United States of America and Col. Denise Lind. CCR, a civil liberties group, filed the case on behalf of journalists including WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange. On Tuesday, 32 media outlets and organizations, including POLITICO and its parent company,  <hyperlink> filed an amicus brief urging the appeals court to make public the briefs, motions, orders, and docket in the Manning court martial.  <paragraph>  Manning has been in custody since May 2010. He faces 22 charges including aiding the enemy, unauthorized disclosure of national security information and violating orders. He could be sentenced to as much as life in prison. His court martial is currently slated to get underway in January at Ft. Meade, Md.
Ex-Senate aide Doug Hampton gets probation |  <paragraph>  A former aide to ex-Sen. John Ensign  R-Nev. , Doug Hampton, was sentenced Wednesday to one year probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of federal ethics statute, court records show.  <paragraph>  Hampton, who left his job as Ensign's administrative assistant after learning of an affair between his wife and the senator, admitted earlier this year that he broke the law when he lobbied a former colleague within a year of leaving the Senate.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell's sentence of one year probation was in line with the defense recommendation. Prosecutors had asked for two years probation.  <paragraph>  In court papers, Hampton's attorney  <hyperlink> painted his client's mistake as part of a messy personal and professional situation that resulted from Ensign's affair. Ensign resigned from the Senate last year after being sharply criticized in a Senate ethics committee report.  <paragraph>  Howell noted that Hampton appeared to be the only person ever sentenced under that legal provision,  <hyperlink> Reuters reported.  You are unique,  the wire service quoted Howell as saying.  <paragraph>  Hampton said Wednesday he was  very relieved  about the sentence,  <hyperlink> according to the Associated Press.
Judge to allow Arizona to enforce key part of anti-illegal immigration law | <paragraph>  A federal judge in Arizona has rejected a last-ditch effort by civil liberties and immigrants' rights groups to block enforcement of a hotly-contested provision of Arizona's anti-illegal immigration law, S.B. 1070.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton said in an order Wednesday that she would not stand in the way of a provision in the law requiring police to determination the immigration status of people they encounter and suspect of being in the country illegally.  <paragraph>  The immigrants' rights groups argued that Bolton could block the law because it coud infringe on individuals' constitutional rights, but Bolton noted that in June the Supreme Court indicated that provision could take effect.  <paragraph>   This Court will not ignore the clear direction in the Arizona opinion that Subsection 2 B  cannot be challenged further on its face before the law takes effect. As the Supreme Court stated, Plaintiffs and the United States may be able to challenge the provision on other preemption and constitutional grounds 'as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect,  Bolton wrote in her order  posted   <hyperlink> here.  She did order that a provision on harboring aliens be blocked.  <paragraph>  Bolton issued a separate order Wednesday asking the State of Arizona and the Justice Department to propose a joint order that would put the Supreme Court's June ruling into effect. She said they could propose a joint order within ten days, or the state could propose an order and the feds could lodge any objections to it. Justice Department officials have declined to comment to POLITICO on their preferred timing for allowing that part of the law to take effect. <paragraph>   Arizona is one big step closer to implementing the core provision of SB 1070. I applaud the federal court for siding with the U.S. Supreme Court in refusing to block the most critical section of this law,  Gov. Jan Brewer  R-Ariz.  said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.  After more than two years of legal challenges, it is time that Section 2 B  of SB 1070 take effect. Given today’s ruling, along with the federal court’s suggestion that it intends in the very near future to formally lift the existing injunction, it is clear the day of implementation is fast approaching.   <paragraph>  Opponents, however, said they will keep up the battle against the law.  <paragraph>   The ACLU of Arizona will act on the court’s message and document racial profiling abuses throughout the state as the first step to guaranteeing equal treatment under the law,” Alessandra Soler, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, said in a statement. “Latino members of our community should not be subjected to unlawful stops based on their race or perceived immigration status. Once this ‘show me your papers’ provision goes into effect, racial profiling will become rampant statewide, as it has been in Maricopa County, and we intend to ramp up our reporting and litigation efforts to seek justice on behalf of the victims of police abuse.”  <paragraph>  Whenever the key stop-check-and-possibly-hold provision takes effect, there could be concerted protests from Latinos in Arizona and perhaps elsewhere. If that date is before the November election, it could impact Hispanic voter turnout not just in Arizona but across the country.  <paragraph>  UPDATE: This post has been updated with comment from Brewer.
Press outlets protest Manning trial secrecy |  <paragraph>  More than 30 news outlets and media organizations lodged an official protest Tuesday against secrecy in the court-martial of Pvt Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst accusing of leaking hundreds of thousands of military reports and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.  <paragraph>  The amicus brief filed with the military's highest court, the Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces, supports a request from the Center for Constitutional Rights to allow public access to motions, briefs, written rulings and the docket in Manning's court-martial.  <paragraph>  While hearings in Manning's case have been in large part public, the motions and briefs the prosecution and defense are arguing about are not available from the court. So, those watching the arguments often have trouble understanding precisely what the lawyers are arguing about.  <paragraph>   This Court should find that such an arrangement is unconstitutional,  lawyers Gregg Leslie and Kristen Rasmussen wrote in the brief, which was joined by POLITICO and parent company Allbritton Communications Co.  The inability to view court documents filed in connection with a particular judicial proceeding burdens the news media’s constitutionally protected right to collect and disseminate the news and severely curtails journalists’ ability to do their jobs effectively.   <paragraph>  The brief  posted   <hyperlink> here  also notes that in a tough economic environment, documents may be essential to journalists' ability to report on the case, particularly one as drawn out as that of Manning, who was arrested in May 2010 and currently has a trial date in next January.  <paragraph>   Public court records, namely the various legal arguments and requests by parties and their counsel contained in the documents, enable journalists to tell the full story, despite the fact that deadline pressures or shrinking news staffs may drastically limit their ability to attend a lengthy judicial proceeding in its entirety,  the media brief says.  <paragraph>  Others signing onto the brief included The Associated Press, Atlantic Media, Dow Jones, Gannett, Hearst, CNN, McClatchy, The New York Times, The New York Daily News, Reuters, the Washington Post, The Tribune Co. and The Washington Post.  <paragraph>  Military prosecutors have urged the court to reject the request for direct access to the court-martial filings. Prosecutors say the public can seek to access the records through the Freedom of Information Act, although that process is almost always untimely and the military has flatly rejected past request for Manning related records. <paragraph>  Manning's defense counsel David Coombs has published some filings on his blog, but the prosecution and the judge have forced him to delete the substance of the prosecution's argument along with the names of virtually all individuals other than Manning mentioned in the documents.  <paragraph>  The brief also points out an odd irony: while legal filings in the miltiary commissions trying alleged Al Qaeda members are — after significant lobbying by the media — published on a military-run website, filings in the highly newsworthy court martial of an American soldier are unavailable to the press and public through official channels.  <paragraph>  Court filings in federal civilian court cases are almost always immediately and directly available to the public and press through an electronic docketing system. The Supreme Court has found a common-law right of access to court records and many courts have found a First Amendment right to such records in most circumstances.  <paragraph>  Military courts have recognized a defendant's constitutional right to a public court-martial since at least the 1980s, the media brief says. And the Army Court of Criminal Appeals found a  qualified  First Amendment right of access to court-martial exhibits in 1998.  <paragraph>  In March, media groups sent Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson a letter seeking access to the Manning court-martial filings. Johnson, who was instrumental in setting up online access to the Guantanamo military commission filings, has not responded to the letter.
Police and Firefighters Unions Join List of Public Employees Targeted by Chicago Mayor Emanuel | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is picking his latest fight with unions representing public workers, though the political context is markedly different than his bitter stand-offs with the Chicago Teachers Union, AFSCME and SEIU. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel has provoked the ire of the firefighter and police unions by planning significant cuts in the firefighter union's next contract and refusing to pay police officers all the overtime they say are due related to the NATO summit in late May. These unions aren't traditionally allied with the city's other public sector unions, which were among the key organizers of protests during the NATO summit, where Chicago police were accused of using excessive force. <PARAGRAPH> While protest leaders circulated videos that they say show police mistreatment of protesters, city officials and business leaders proclaimed the city's handling of the summit a success and praised law enforcement. But the Fraternal Order of Police has filed four grievances related to the summit and overtime pay, charging that the city is not honoring their union contract or its promises in regards to paying 3,100 officers for overtime—part of a bill for taxpayers that is expected to be huge. Officers had their days off and furlough days cancelled over a two-week period and were ordered to work 12-hour days in preparation for and during the summit. <PARAGRAPH> The union is disputing how overtime was calculated, including for officers who worked six or seven days within a week. A city spokesperson has said officers will get all the overtime due them, with checks arriving in mid-June. <PARAGRAPH> On the FOP's website, union president Mike Shields wrote,  We protected the mayor's residence from anarchists. You'd think he could at least pay us what we are owed.  <PARAGRAPH> On May 30, he told the Chicago Sun-Times,  The Chicago Police Department made Mayor Emanuel shine throughout the nation and the world. Yet he won't stand up for us and say, 'You guys had my back, I'm going to have yours.'  <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile the Chicago Firefighters Union contract is up June 30, and Emanuel has indicated cuts are in store for the next one as part of a move to reform the department. Emanuel's proposal reportedly calls for eliminating duty availability pay, bonuses for firefighters with cross-training as paramedics, and clothing allowances; and reducing the number of people per engine from 10 to 9. Union president Tom Ryan called the proposals  horrendous  and said Emanuel is using the word  reform  as a euphemism for  cuts.  <PARAGRAPH> City Inspector General Joe Ferguson has said the city could save more than $50 million by eliminating extra pay for police and firefighters for being on call 24 hours a day, and an additional $50 million by reducing the required number of workers staffing a piece of fire equipment from five to four, in order to allow the staff cuts per engine. Altering the minimum staffing limit is what led to a firefighter strike in 1980, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Emanuel is also proposing significant changes to police and firefighter pension plans, including increasing employee contributions and raising the retirement age by five years. <PARAGRAPH> Firefighters have long been known for having extreme political clout and enjoying generous contracts and pension plans, even as the department was accused of racism and irresponsibility, with reports of parties involving prostitutes while firemen were on the clock during former Mayor Richard M. Daley's tenure. Last year an investigation by the Chicago News Cooperative found that the number of firefighters on the public payroll is proportionally the highest of any major city and is out of step with the steadily shrinking number of fires in Chicago. <PARAGRAPH> Many Chicagoans surely agree reforms of police and fire contracts and closer scrutiny of these departments are needed and timely, especially given the cost to taxpayers and widespread complaints about many police officers' behavior. But others see Emanuel's moves as a general signal of disrespect to unions and the collective bargaining process. Chicago's local ABC affiliate  The police demands for NATO overtime pay come as many residents are still vehemently questioning the priorities behind spending so much on the summit while services are being slashed and crime is epidemic in poor neighborhoods—with 10 people killed and more than 40 shot over Memorial Day weekend alone. <PARAGRAPH> In a scathing column in the June 1 Southwest News Herald, Ray Hanania attacked Emanuel's focus on the NATO summit and what it represents at the expense of regular people: <PARAGRAPH>  He did a masterful job of taking the NATO conference, which never should have been brought to Chicago, and making it look like Chicago has somehow become a better place because didn't replicate the 'police riot' that took place in 1968. Chicago is still the city that doesn't work, its narrow shoulders getting smaller and holding up fewer and fewer. 
Austerity Debate in Ireland Heats Up as EU Treaty Vote Nears | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CORK, DUBLIN AND BELFAST—In such a lush, green, rainsoaked country, the huge color poster of cracked dry earth on a bridge in Dublin looks incongruous. But to opponents of the European Union fiscal treaty that Irish citizens are voting on May 31, it represents a bleak future committed to austerity policies limiting the size of the country's deficit and debt. Next to the cracked earth is an image of lush tropical plants, representing the  growth  the poster says is possible if citizens turn down the treaty and don't curb government spending on social services and public jobs. <PARAGRAPH> The week before the vote, the bustling streets of Dublin, Cork and other cities are plastered with posters both for and against the treaty, with polls saying the treaty is expected to gain majority approval though support for a  no  vote is growing, as is approval for the nationalist party Sinn Fein, which is leading opposition to it. <PARAGRAPH> Trade unions and other groups have recently demonstrated in Brussels, Madrid and The Hague in support of Irish citizens opposed to the treaty, and as of this writing, a demonstration is planned in Copenhagen the week of the vote. <PARAGRAPH> In Dublin and Cork, ads produced by opponents of the treaty appear much more prevalent and from a wider variety of sources than pro-treaty advertisements. Opponents frame the measure as an  austerity treaty  and include images of bread lines, a ball and chain, a large fish devouring a smaller one, a yellow sign warning  Danger: Permanent Austerity Ahead  and so on. The parties and groups producing anti-treaty materials include Sinn Fein, the Socialist Party, the United Left Alliance, the Workers Party and Libertas, whose posters say  Cut Bank Debt or No Deal.  Fliers for meetings and demonstrations against the treaty are ubiquitous. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, posters supporting the measure call it a  stability treaty,  promising it will increase investment and jobs, and feature images including a tattered Irish flag, presumably representing Ireland's future if it does not ratify. Treaty proponents threaten that Ireland will be  isolated  from the EU and unable to obtain future bailouts, loans or investment if voters reject the treaty. <PARAGRAPH> During a nationally televised address from Sinn Fein's annual party meeting in Killarney on May 26, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams called on voters to refuse the treaty, saying people  need to ask themselves if recent budget cuts led to jobs and growth...The answer is obvious. The answer is No — if you accept that, you should vote No.” <PARAGRAPH> Adams had called for Taoiseach Enda Kenny to debate him on the treaty. Kenny refused, but was given an amount of television time May 27 equal to the time Adams spent discussing the treaty to make his points. <PARAGRAPH> Instead of cutting government spending, Adams echoed the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' call for a stimulus program to create jobs—a 13-billion-Euro, three-year plan that Adams said would create 130,000 jobs. <PARAGRAPH> The Irish Times reported that Sinn Fein's popularity has climbed coinciding with its stance on the treaty, it now being the second most popular party in Ireland behind Fine Gael, and Adams being the most popular party leader. The Labour Party's support has dropped significantly since it has been supporting the treaty. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, Kenny reportedly also backed the idea of a stimulus package in EU talks over the weekend  in that case, a European stimulus package being promoted by new French president Francois Hollande . However, the Irish Independent reported that Kenny does not want a stimulus introduced into a renegotiated financial treaty, as some European leaders have proposed, in part because that would bolster opponents' claims that the treaty can be changed after the Irish vote. <PARAGRAPH> The Independent notes that Kenny is also skittish about a Financial Transaction Tax  being implemented in the Eurozone countries, as some have proposed, since such a measure  widely backed by progressives  would put the Irish financial industry at a comparative disadvantage if London's investment industry were not subject to the tax. <PARAGRAPH> In his televised speech, Adams also called for the reunification of Ireland with Northern Ireland—Sinn Fein's central platform—as a way to increase investment and create jobs, saying: <PARAGRAPH> A united Ireland makes sense, a single island economy makes sense...It does not make sense on an island this size and with a population of six million to have two states, two bureaucracies, two sets of government departments and two sets of agencies competing for inward investment. <PARAGRAPH> The Workers Party of Northern Ireland opposes the treaty. Though Northern Ireland citizens can't vote in the May 31 referendum, many unions and labor leaders see the struggles of those in Ireland and Northern Ireland as one and the same, as evidenced at the Belfast May Day parade several weeks ago. <PARAGRAPH> Irish members of Parliament have time off the week of the vote to canvas voters about the treaty, according to the Irish Independent, which humorously warned residents to  lock your doors  in anticipation of the visits. An anti-treaty Op Ed by David McWilliams in the Irish Independent said the treaty defies basic logic regarding the economic behavior of individuals versus economic systems, noting that it might be wise and valorous for any given individual to cut spending and save money, but if everyone does that at once, the economy freezes up. McWilliams wrote: <PARAGRAPH> The vast majority of employed Irish people are employed in the domestic sector. This means that we buy and sell stuff to one another. This implies a golden rule, that many business people fail to grasp: your spending is my income, and my spending is your income. <PARAGRAPH> Paul Krugman made a similar argument in The New York Times, writing that  spending cuts in a depressed economy just make the depression deeper.   Like treaty opponents, Krugman attacked Irish leaders' claims that Ireland's economy has been recovering since instituting a previous round of austerity measures. <PARAGRAPH> It seems the numbers do show Ireland is severely struggling economically. But in two weeks traveling around the country, I personally could not help but be struck by how prosperous Ireland appears compared to the U.S., where drastic cuts in public spending have also been hotly debated. In a wide variety of Irish cities, towns and rural areas, I saw few vacant buildings or signs of homelessness, extreme poverty or decaying infrastructure; by contrast, energetic and apparently effective public campaigns to eliminate litter and improve road safety were obvious everywhere. <PARAGRAPH> It was evident that many struggle to make a living in Belfast in Northern Ireland, where Protestant residents still throw bricks and bottles over the wall that separates Shankill from the Catholic neighborhoods. Paddy Campbell, who leads famous  and excellent  Black Cab tours about the Troubles, noted that Belfast is only now developing a tourist museum about the Titanic as well as other investments expected to create jobs that two decades ago would have been unthinkable given the violence and inequality. But even in the neighborhoods where Catholics have suffered extreme marginalization and repression for centuries, there were not the outward signs of economic desperation that one would find in New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago or countless other U.S. cities. <PARAGRAPH> These observations don't mean I doubt the seriousness of Ireland's economic crisis or the significance of the treaty decision. Rather the trip has driven home for me just how dire things have become in the U.S., which was once the place many thousands of immigrants from Ireland fled escaping famine, repression and poverty to pursue and often achieve the American Dream.
As Mines Develop in Michigan, a Reminder of Copper’s Complex Past | <PARAGRAPH> ALLIHIES, IRELAND—Last week, as I was catching up on U.S. news from Allihies, a small town perched on rugged cliffs on Ireland's west coast, I read reports from Michigan's Upper Peninsula of the latest developments in Rio Tinto's in-the-works copper and nickel mine. Many in the economically-struggling area hope the mine will bring badly needed jobs and investment. Others think new mining in the area will destroy the outdoor recreation and tourism that have been a major part of the economy since historic mines closed up decades ago. Among the opponents is the Huron Mountain Club, an exclusive group whose early members include East Coast and Midwest industrial titans, which recently filed a lawsuit attempting to block the mine. <PARAGRAPH> As in the Upper Peninsula, copper mining was once the lifeblood of Allihies. And when Allihies’ underground mines were tapped out and closed in the late 1800s, many of the Irish and Cornish miners left for mining jobs in the U.S., specifically in the Upper Peninsula and Butte, Mont., where they became famous for radical labor and anti-war activism. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The bravery and strength of Irish miners in Butte who went on strike opposing World War I, and U.S. support of the British, are not surprising, given the conditions they had labored under in the Irish mines. As I learned while visiting the excellent Allihies Copper Mine Museum, miners  including many children  toiled underground for 12-hour shifts and were paid no wages—only a sum for the actual copper extracted from the ore they hauled out  minus payments to the mine company for their equipment and supplies . The concentration of the copper in the ore was a matter of chance—it might bear none at all. <PARAGRAPH> Miners had a one-in-two chance of contracting deadly silicosis from breathing in the rock dust, and were also at great risk from explosions, gassing and other disasters. The museum includes logs listing those killed, including one worker who died from an infection following a fracture of the skull, and a 13-year-old who died from leg injuries after suffering for hours. It also notes that after the death of one worker in a mine, his widow received only a small pension for one year. <PARAGRAPH> The miners worked in teams, with light from candles stuck to their helmets with lumps of clay. One would hold a spike to the rock while others slammed it with massive hammers. During blasting, miners ran for their lives.  You hold your ears,  notes text from the exhibit,  but some of you don't have to because you are already deaf.  <PARAGRAPH> One display describes the innovation of the  man engine,  a crude escalator that carried men up and down the deep shafts so that they weren't exhausted by the time they reached bottom—a dangerous, hour-long descent for which they received no pay. Wealthy mine owner John Puxley had calculated how much more he could profit if miners moved in and out more efficiently, noting that the man engine would also  keep the miners quiet.  Puxley imported food for miners during the famine of 1845, but the exhibit notes that it was not for  purely humanitarian reasons,  as he knew the mine would close if miners starved to death like so many Irish did during those years. <PARAGRAPH> Miners from Cornwall often served as managers in the Irish mines, and once the Irish mines closed, they, like the Irish workers, fled to Michigan, California and Montana in search of new jobs. Many of the people hoping that a resurgence of mining in the Great Lakes region will create more jobs are descendants of these Cornish and Irish immigrants, as evidenced not only by their surnames, but also by the doughy meat-and-vegetable pasties sold in roadside shops around the U.P.  An impressive multimedia presentation at the Allihies museum depicts the lively St. Patrick's Day parades and Irish dance festivals in Butte—where Joe Hill often sang for striking miners—and notes that today, fifth-generation Irish Americans in Butte, most of whom have never been to Ireland, celebrate a culture  frozen in time  when their predecessors emigrated. The exhibit also describes the labor history of Butte, including the U.S. Army’s occupation of the town from 1917 until 1921, when it  broke the back of the labor movement and secured the interests of the Anaconda copper company.  <PARAGRAPH> Today, copper is mined in ore that has exponentially lower concentrations than in the 1800s, given modern mining, refining technology and high prices. During the 1950s, a Canadian company hired locals to explore mining again around Allihies but ultimately decided it wasn't worth it. Now, Allihies’ rich mining history is part of the town's appeal to tourists; in addition to the museum there is a heritage trail winding by old mine shafts, crumbling stone engine houses and reservoirs used to provide hydropower for the operations. There are dreams of opening the underground shafts for tours, or even holding concerts in one of the cavernous  stopes,  where sunlight filtering in from the fractured rock creates an ethereal effect. <PARAGRAPH> The photos and descriptions of the horrifying labor conditions and payment arrangements in the Allihies mines reminds one just how much things have changed since those days, thanks largely to the efforts of union immigrant miners. When those Irish mines opened two centuries ago, no one could imagine the iPads, car batteries, skyscrapers and precision machinery that are now driving demand for copper and other metals. But people are still fighting to balance the economic incentives and harmful effects of mining, struggling over where and how it is mined, by whom and for whom.
Will More Austerity Work for Ireland? | <PARAGRAPH>  ALLIHIES, IRELAND—Life appears peaceful and idyllic on the famous green hills above white-capped seas and plunging cliffs on Ireland’s west coast. Woolly sheep graze on impossibly steep slopes; people chat inside prim pubs, walk dogs along ancient stone walls or tend immaculate gardens outside cute cottages. Aside from a scattering of vacant newish McMansion-style homes, there are no obvious signs of the economic distress that has clutched the country since the  Celtic Tiger  economic boom crashed and burned several years ago.  <PARAGRAPH>  But Ireland is indeed hurting economically, and the country is now center stage in the bitter controversy over how to ease Europe’s economic woes and decide the economic future of the European Union. On May 31, citizens will vote on whether to accept the European Union austerity treaty that played a significant role in recent political upheavals in France and Greece. Proponents say the treaty is essential to Ireland’s economic future, including its ability to get international loans and bailouts and attract private investment.  <PARAGRAPH>  <PICTURE>  <PARAGRAPH>  Opponents, including the Sinn Fein party, say the treaty would curb the country’s chances for economic growth and job creation, and sacrifice Ireland’s independence.  Austerity Isn’t Working – Stand Up for Ireland,  read the  Vote No  banners along narrow country roads in coastal villages between the River Shannon and the Berea peninsula. In larger towns and cities in the region like Tralee and Ennis,  Yes  banners saying  Integrity, Stability, Recovery  and  Working for Ireland  far outnumber  No  banners.  <PARAGRAPH>  Contrary to some Irish pundits who indicate that the referendum’s results are up in the air and that Irish citizens may say  no,  people I talked with over a week along the western coast feel that the treaty’s ratification is inevitable. Opinions varied on whether or not the treaty is actually a good thing for Ireland.  <PARAGRAPH>  An innkeeper on a tiny harbor on the Berea peninsula, where sheep and mussel farming are the main economic activities, is angry and exasperated that regular citizens have to pay for the malfeasance of politicians and big banks who got Ireland into its current dilemma. She thinks people will suffer because of the austerity measures, but she says the government is dead-set on passing the treaty and she believes it will get its way. A cab driver in Ennis said,  It has to pass; we don’t have a choice.  The proprietor of a gift shop in the bustling town of Killarney plans to vote  no,  saying,  We’ve given enough away already. You don’t get out of a recession that way. Sinn Fein politicians, including party president Gerry Adams, have been holding town hall meetings around the region – advertised on hand-lettered posters saying  all welcome  – to drum up support for a  no  vote. They are framing it as part of the party’s Defend Rural Ireland Initiative, and they stress that they are not against the EU or Eurozone and that Ireland can continue its membership without ratifying the treaty. They are also framing a  no  vote as part of a larger resistance movement to  big bullies,  which includes opposition to fracking for natural gas in Ireland, ire over new household taxes and controversy over bans on cutting turf in bogs for environmental reasons  many small farmers cut their own peat to burn for heating and cooking .  <PARAGRAPH>  Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny was among the 25 European leaders who signed the treaty earlier this year, but each country still needs to ratify it through their own legislative procedures, with 12 ratifications out of 17 Eurozone countries needed for it to take effect in January 2013. The treaty limits the size of the deficit and debt a country is allowed to accrue, which opponents say will gut their potential for important government spending and hence economic growth in these tough times. So far, only Portugal, Slovenia and Greece -- under the former government -- have ratified the treaty.  <PARAGRAPH>  Newly elected French leader Francois Hollande said the country would not ratify, and the political turmoil in Greece means its ratification there is also highly in doubt. Now there is much talk of a  Grexit  – Greece's leaving the EU and the Eurozone altogether -- and Germany has canceled its own scheduled May treaty ratification vote, given the developments.  <PARAGRAPH>  At a press conference on May 15, Sinn Fein jobs spokesperson Peadar Toibin said:  <PARAGRAPH>  Only Government led investment in job creation will tackle the unemployment crisis and lead to growth and recovery….The fact is the government can’t have it both ways. You cannot have a twin track approach. The choice is austerity or investment in jobs. This Treaty would prevent the type of government led investment which is needed for economic recovery in this State.  <PARAGRAPH>  In March, Ireland's unemployment rate was at 10 percent, with its youth unemployment rate among the highest in Europe and many young people planning to emigrate.  Its unemployment rate is still notably lower than Spain and Greece, which were at 24 and 21 percent, respectively.  A recent report by the group Social Justice Ireland found that more than 700,000 citizens are living in poverty, a 13 percent increase from two years ago.  <PARAGRAPH>  The Irish parties pushing the treaty say it will mean less austerity in the long run because it will give private investors and lenders confidence in Ireland. Joining the treaty is essential to securing loans or other financing through the intergovernmental European Stability Mechanism  ESM , an in-the-works and trouble-plagued successor to similar international lending bodies.  <PARAGRAPH>  In an address Fianna Fail TD Michael Martin said:  <PARAGRAPH>  Voting Yes will ensure that Ireland has access to the cheapest and most secure funding for our public services - and it is an essential part of the agenda to restore growth and job creation to Ireland and Europe. In two years’ time Ireland will need to raise at least €18bn from somewhere. We want Ireland to be able to borrow that money at affordable rates on the open market.  <PARAGRAPH>  Ireland is the only country putting the treaty to a popular referendum, with the results playing a significant symbolic and pragmatic role in the overall outcome of the treaty. Other countries’ parliaments need a simple or super majority to ratify.  <PARAGRAPH>  A website about the treaty published by the Institute for International and European Affairs says that Ireland will not be forced to leave the Eurozone or EU if it votes  no  on the referendum, but that  a 'no' vote risks diminished influence for Ireland and potentially a second tier status for Ireland within the Eurozone.   <PARAGRAPH>  There were calls for the EU to relieve some of Ireland’s bank debt to help build support for the austerity treaty in the referendum, and a group of Irish TDs  members of Ireland’s lower house of parliament  called for the vote to be delayed until fall to see how events on the world stage shake out and to see if economic growth measures could be added to the treaty. Meanwhile, treaty proponents are calling for a second vote if the treaty is voted down on May 31.  <PARAGRAPH>  Some have argued that Ireland can survive on its own without bailouts, in part because of its attractiveness to U.S. and other high-tech companies. This is how Fintan O’Toole described the debate over the austerity treaty in an editorial in the Irish Times:  <PARAGRAPH>  One way of putting the referendum that I like is that Brussels and Germany are the mother and father of the EU and the rest of the countries are kids. And some kids spend the money wisely but some, like Ireland, spend it on crazy things.  So the mum and dad keep giving the kids more and more money. But eventually they put their foot down and say, ‘Right, you can keep borrowing our money – if you sign this form to let us know what you’ll use it for.’  This, apparently, is what we’re teaching our kids now – that we are all children, subject to our strict but benign parents in Brussels and Berlin.  <PARAGRAPH>  Like Sinn Fein, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has called for a massive government investment in creating jobs. This month, Congress general secretary David Begg called for a  New Deal  instead of the European austerity treaty. He also pushed for the delay of the ratification vote, given developments in France and Greece. A press release from the Congress quoted Begg saying:  <PARAGRAPH>  Ireland has been a poster child of globalisation and, more recently, a poster child for austerity. Let us seize the opportunity to be a beacon of something good for a change.  <PARAGRAPH>  It is of course widely believed that the best hope for  change  lie in a country’s youth, but since the economy crashed Ireland’s youth have been leaving the country in droves, with the number of young emigrants increasing three-fold since 2008, according to the April report by Social Justice Ireland.  That report also chronicled the country’s income inequality, noting that  the poorest 10 per cent of households have an average disposable income of €210 a week, compared to an average of €2,276 a week for the richest 10 per cent.    <PARAGRAPH>  The Irish Times quoted Social Justice Ireland director Father Sean Healy on the likely impact of increased austerity measures on Ireland’s youth:  <PARAGRAPH>  The austerity programme is contributing to Ireland’s loss of young people, the implications of which are stark as this loss will pose significant problems for economic recovery…The emigration ‘brain drain’ which in some quarters is being heralded perversely as a ‘safety valve’ is in fact a serious problem for Ireland and may well lead to a skills deficit in the long-term.
New Chicago Air Cargo Center: More Chinese Imports, and More Jobs? | <PARAGRAPH> Chicago is often billed as the nation’s top destination and departure point for Chinese imports and exports. The city’s capacity for trade with China is supposed to get a big boost in the coming years because of a planned new $200 million cargo handling center at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, which was announced by Mayor Rahm Emanuel last week. <PARAGRAPH> The center drew praise from both labor and business leaders, as it is projected to create “more than 11,000” jobs—actually 1,200 temporary construction jobs and 1,200 permanent jobs, while indirectly sparking the creation of 10,000 jobs regionally. While the jobs are sorely needed and the Chicago Federation of Labor endorsed the plan in a joint statement with the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, skeptics question how great the jobs will actually be and, in principle, whether facilitating more imports of Chinese goods is a positive thing for local U.S. workers. <PARAGRAPH> The plan involves $62 million of city airport funds and a $130 million investment by the private firm Aeroterm LLC. The construction jobs will likely be filled by union members, but it is unclear from media coverage and the mayor’s announcement whether the permanent jobs at the center will be union or exactly what types of jobs are expected to be created indirectly. <PARAGRAPH> According to Crain’s Chicago Business, Aeroterm will act as the property manager and lease the cargo-handling facility out to customers. The story says there are no certain clients identified yet, but Aeroterm feels confident enough about prospects to put its money on the line. To anyone familiar with the logistics industry  essentially another form of cargo handling  often explored on this blog, the arrangement should raise some concerns. <PARAGRAPH> Warehouses where goods are received and restaged for delivery to big box stores and other facilities are typically owned by one company, operated by another and staffed and run by several more layers of subcontractors. The workforce is disproportionately made up of temporary contractors with no benefits or job security, and complaints of health impacts, sexual harrassment and discrimination are rampant. On the surface—albeit without a specific understanding of how the center will operate—it seems the O’Hare cargo handling center might raise similar problems. <PARAGRAPH> Labor’s support for the cargo center is interesting given that the service employee  SEIU  and UNITE-HERE unions have been trying to organize passenger service workers and concessions workers, respectively, at Chicago airports, and they say Emanuel’s policies are directly jeopardizing airport jobs and degrading working conditions—as David Moberg wrote for In These Times in March.   <PARAGRAPH> The center will tap graduates of the Chicago City Colleges enrolled in the aviation training program, one of the new job-focused programs the Emanuel administration is instituting at the City Colleges. Crain’s said the City College connection means it is likely that cargo center workers would be paid at least in part with TIF  tax increment financing  funds for six months before the private employer takes over their payroll. <PARAGRAPH> Based on the preliminary details so far available, it seems like this could, in the best case, be a way of leveraging public funds for significant private job creation and augmenting Chicago’s central location as a transit and trade hub…or, in the worst case, be another example of taxpayer funds being used to subsidize a private venture that creates largely temporary and nonunion jobs. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile the Rockford Register Star reports that the Chicago cargo center may compete with cargo expansion plans by the airport in Rockford—a working-class town 80 miles west of Chicago. The paper reports: <PARAGRAPH> In Rockford, airport officials continue to pursue cargo airlines. The airport says air cargo operators can save thousands of dollars per flight by landing here and trucking cargo to operations near O'Hare. The airport is also working to lure a company that provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services for cargo and passenger jets. <PARAGRAPH> I also wonder whether Chicago's new cargo center will affect the small airport and job prospects in hard-scrabble Gary, Ind., where civic leaders have long talked of expanding the airport and increasing its cargo handling to spur economic development. The Gary airport currently has almost no passenger traffic, instead relying largely on cargo.
Pearls Along the Mississippi: An Unsung Labor Hero Gets Her Due | <PARAGRAPH> MUSCATINE, IOWA—Today the town of Muscatine, Iowa, which overlooks the Mississippi River, looks relatively inconspicuous—one of many working-class river towns with grassy parks abutting the flood-prone wide river, brick factories-turned-bars along the main street and ornate but peeling Victorian homes up on the hill. <PARAGRAPH> But there are hints of Muscatine’s illustrious past: a riverside sculpture of a man in a flatboat with clams surrounding his feet, raising two shellfish rakes above his head; the word “buttons” emblazoned in chipped paint on some of the old brick structures. In its heyday, this area produced an astounding one third of the buttons sold worldwide—shiny, delicate “pearl” buttons produced from shells of the wealth of clams and mussels that once filled this stretch of the Mississippi, where a bend taking it east-west  rather than north-south  calmed the current enough to allow the shellfish to proliferate. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The local button industry was started in 1891 by an enterprising German immigrant, John Fredrick Boepple, skilled in making buttons from sea shells, who brought his manual-operated button press machine to Muscatine and launched a quickly mushrooming industry. Soon thousands of men were collecting shellfish from the river and its tributaries, and thousands of women and teenagers turned them into glistening buttons sewed onto decorative small cards with names like Mermaid and Blue Bird. <PARAGRAPH> Pearl was the name for the shell interiors used to make the buttons, and it was also the name of a fiery young labor activist renowned in her time but relatively unknown in more recent decades. But she appears to be enjoying a resurgence of fame now. <PARAGRAPH> Industry spy turned crusading organizer <PARAGRAPH> Pearl McGill started working in the button factories as a teenager as a sort of spy for the industry, recruited by her uncle’s friend to see if workers were as “shiftless and lazy” as bosses suspected. More likely, many say, was that the company wanted her to report on union organizing activities. McGill was also trying to earn money to study to be a teacher. <PARAGRAPH> Though her job was to report to the button industry power brokers, young Pearl soon found herself sympathizing more with the workers. Soon she was an activist and prominent member of the Women's Trade Union League and the Industrial Workers of the World  IWW  helping to organize the button workers and also traveling around the heartland and the east coast to make speeches and play a key role in the famous textile workers strikes of 1912. <PARAGRAPH> The Muscatine button workers battled with politicians and bosses, with strikes, violence and intrigue common. All the drama ended several decades later when much-cheaper, similar-looking plastic buttons became available. The pearl button industry basically died, except for small demand for vintage buttons for designer clothing. <PARAGRAPH>  The industry's sharp decline was good news for native mussels and clams, which have been wiped out in many parts of the Mississippi River system, though efforts are underway to help restore them.  <PARAGRAPH> A free museum in Muscatine pays homage to McGill—who did end up getting a scholarship to study teaching, from fellow union activist Helen Keller—and to the role of socialism and unions in the button industry and the workplaces of that time. On my visit to the museum last week, the author of a new book about McGill—along with one of McGill’s now-elderly relatives—happened to be there. <PARAGRAPH> Jeffrey Copeland’s new book— Shell Games: The Life and Times of Pearl McGill, Industrial Spy and Pioneer Labor Activist —is a fictionalized take on McGill’s dramatic life, including her murder on the banks of the Mississippi River and the question of whether her union activities played a role in her killing, in 1924 when she was just 29. A jealous and unstable ex-husband was blamed. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile in recent years, others have published nonfiction accounts of McGill’s life, based in part on the young worker’s letters, including to her parents, who lived a simple, conservative country life on an Iowa farm. <PARAGRAPH> One of those letters, provided to the Iowa Women’s Archives by Kate Rousmaniere, said: <PARAGRAPH> The militia got out in the streets at Muscatine the other day to break the crowd away from one of the factories and some of the girls caught a solider boy up on fourth street and took his gun and cap and coat away from him and beat it. Ha! Ha! <PARAGRAPH> A play was also staged in the area in March, during Women’s History Month:  “Bread, Roses and Buttons: Pearl McGill and the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike,” written by Janet Schlapkohl at the University of Iowa Theater Arts Department. <PARAGRAPH> 100 years later, a Muscatine lockout <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile a dramatic and bitter labor conflict has played out in Muscatine in recent years, though without the prominence or massive community support of a century ago. For the past three years, about 300 union members with the United Food and Commercial Workers  UFCW  union have been locked out of a corn products plant called Grain Processing Corp  GPC  on Muscatine’s river bank, which makes corn syrup, corn oil, corn-based alcohol and other products for the global market. <PARAGRAPH> Tattered signs supporting the locked-out workers still adorn the windows and porches of some local houses, but for the most part, after a burst of solidarity, the town has moved on. <PARAGRAPH> The UFCW workers were locked out after refusing to agree to a new contract that gave the family-owned company the right to replace them with nonunion contractors. Now the plant is indeed up and running with nonunion workers. The union continues to demand members’ right to go back to work, and they say safety and productivity have suffered since the new workers were brought in. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile the plant poses a health and environmental risk to nearby residents and a swath of the Mississippi River valley, since it emits high amount s of particulate matter that is linked to respiratory and cardiac disease. The emissions also contribute to the area being out of compliance with federal standards, meaning it is much harder for new job-creating industries to open if they would release any particulate. <PARAGRAPH> A community group has for the past several years been working to draw the connections between the labor issues and the environmental issues around GPC and other area industries, including filing a lawsuit against GPC and framing the struggle as an environmental justice fight. The group is called Clean Air Muscatine, so the acronym—fittingly evoking the town’s storied shellfish past—is CLAM.
Sisyphus and Labor: Chicago Play Celebrates Workers’ Struggles, Past and Present | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> <PARAGRAPH> EVANSTON, IL.—Most people know Sisyphus as the man forever condemned to endlessly push a boulder up a hill, only to have it roll down again. Northwestern University performance studies chair D. Soyini  Madison probably isn’t the first one to use Sisyphus as a metaphor for the seemingly meaningless and soul-sucking nature of hard, repetitive manual labor—which so many people must do to survive, even as their work leaves them relatively little time and energy for really “living.” <PARAGRAPH> But in the play Labor Rites, running May 11 through May 20 at Northwestern, Madison and her crew add a new, unexpected and refreshing twist to the legend of Sisyphus. Rather than being mentally and emotionally crushed and deadened by “dreadful, purposeless repetitious labor,” he is recast as the archetypal “trickster,” in the tradition of Kokopelli, Coyote, Puck and other characters, who has the last laugh because he manages to take control of his own fate and find beauty and glory in his toils. “He turned his punishment and drudgery into possibilities and freedom!” an actor declares. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> In this way, Sisyphus becomes an apt and timeless metaphor for the labor movement, wherein people come together in inspiring acts of resistance, bravery, creativity and pure joy in the face of grueling and brutal oppression and exploitation. <PARAGRAPH> Madison’s play, performed by an impressive cast of undergraduate students, weaves together vignettes of famous and lesser-known labor struggles and labor heroes past and present, with dance, dramatic tableaus and humor from narrator “clowns” and a sort of chorus providing the glue. The mesmerizing physical numbers include a recurring ballet wherein the cast mimics the repetitive motions of sewing in a sweatshop, simultaneously expressing both grace and pain. <PARAGRAPH> The first half of the two-hour production invokes historical sagas: the hell-raising of Mother Jones, the martyrdom of Joe Hill, the deadly Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, the Haymarket Affair, the Memphis sanitation workers strike, the Bread and Roses garment workers movement of a century ago… Being reminded of the boldness, sheer courage and inspiring successes of the labor movement in these decades past, I had the sinking feeling that the movement is in a sorry state today by comparison. <PARAGRAPH> But the second half of the play does much to dispel this feeling, celebrating recent struggles including the Republic Windows and Doors occupation, the battle over public workers union rights in Wisconsin and the UNITE-HERE cafeteria workers campaign.  Disclosure: the Republic Windows segment is adapted from my book Revolt on Goose Island: The Chicago Factory Takeover and What it Says About the Economic Crisis.  <PARAGRAPH> The play invokes the struggles of everyday workers, like those who push wheelchairs at O’Hare and Midway airports or the maid who knows all her employers’ secrets because “half the time they don’t even know you are there.” The waitress “busting your butt for people who don’t know jack about good manners.” The secretary paying more taxes than her boss; the West Virginia coal miner worried about black lung disease. In one of various pointed current references, an actor says emphatically, “Labor is the United States Postal Service!” <PARAGRAPH> Throughout the play Madison stresses the importance of unions, including a vignette where characters square off over common popular criticisms of unions: that they were important in their time but are no longer relevant, that they are bloated and corrupt, that they kill jobs. The ending montage includes calls for a six-hour work day, for “re-imagining labor” and the “right to live, not simply to exist,” peppered with quotes from historical and contemporary leaders like Chicago organizer James Thindwa  a member of In These Times' board of directors  and Elwood Flowers, of the 1968 transit workers strike. <PARAGRAPH> Madison specializes in theater and performance integrated with ongoing social issues; her past works include staging oral histories of service workers and laborers in North Carolina  “I Have My Story to Tell”  and “Water Rites,” a multimedia piece about the privatization of water in Ghana. Her recent book Acts of Activism: Human Rights and Radical Performance explores how women in Ghana use performance in their daily struggles for dignity, economic justice and democracy. <PARAGRAPH> Labor Rites plays Friday May 18 and Saturday May 19 at 8 p.m. and Sunday May 20 at 2 p.m. at the Wallis Theater on Northwestern’s campus in Evanston, Ill., 1949 Campus Drive. Admission is free.
Exiled Mexican Union Leader Wins Standoff With Govt. After Court Decision | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Union steelworkers and miners across North America celebrated last week as the Mexican Supreme Court dropped all criminal charges against Mineros  miners  union leader Napoleon Gomez Urrutia. Urretia had been living in Canada since 2006, subsidized by the United Steelworkers  USW  union, which has a formal partnership with the Mineros. <PARAGRAPH> The government had lodged serious corruption charges against Gomez in 2006 in what labor leaders in the U.S., Canada and Mexico saw as part of the government’s war on independent unions. Labor conflicts in Mexico include the high-profile strike at the Cananea copper mine and other mines in Mexico. Cananea, owned by Grupo Mexico, was shut down for three years by the strike until police ousted strikers and re-opened the mine  illegally, the union alleges  in 2010. <PARAGRAPH> Among other things, the government charged that Gomez had embezzled $55 million from the union. Supporters have always said the allegations were trumped up for political reasons, and the funds are now accounted for. The Canadian government refused to extradite Gomez and granted him legal residency. <PARAGRAPH> In a 3-1 vote, the Mexican Supreme Court’s Second Chamber ruled that the Mexican labor ministry had acted illegally when it revoked recognition of Gomez as General Secretary of the National Union of Mine, Metal and Steelworkers  aka Los Mineros . The court decided that only the union itself can decide whether a leader’s election and tenure is legitimate. <PARAGRAPH> Gomez’s supporters had said he has had “one foot back in Mexico” since late April, when a federal court granted an injunction that prevented his arrest. Now, all charges are dropped. <PARAGRAPH> USW President Leo Gerard said in a statement: <PARAGRAPH> Today's decision should sound the death knell for the Mexican government's vicious and illegal persecution of Napoleon Gomez and Los Mineros. <PARAGRAPH> A dissident group within the union has said it will file a complaint with the Organization of American States alleging that Gomez’s election to head the union was illegal, and that he should not head the union. <PARAGRAPH> Gomez’s supporters note that the Supreme Court decision does not mean he will be safe from further persecution and intimidation by state, federal or private actors in Mexico, which of course is wracked by violence, chaos and corruption related to the drug war that many argue has also facilitated attacks on organized labor and other activists. <PARAGRAPH> The government of Vicente Fox, elected in 2000, was known for attacking the independent trade union movement—specifically, the miners union. USW called for an international tourist boycott of Mexico after Fox’s government removed Gomez from leadership of the Mineros in 2006, with Gerard calling the move “naked aggression” and a “blatant attempt to stifle the voice of workers and all progressive unions in Mexico.” <PARAGRAPH> The government’s long-simmering animosity toward the progressive, independent miners union was exacerbated by the union’s high-profile opposition to the government’s decision to seal the Pasta de Conchos mine without recovering bodies or possibly survivors after a devastating Feb. 19, 2006, explosion. That mine, like Cananea, was owned by Grupo Mexico, which has close ties to the government. <PARAGRAPH> Persecution of Los Mineros continued under current president Felipe Calderon. Mexico’s presidential election on July 1 could see the PRI party, which had ruled for 71 years until 2000, reclaim the presidency from the conservative PAN. <PARAGRAPH> Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who lost by a narrow margin and refused to accept the results in 2006—swearing himself in and declaring an “alternate government”—is the candidate of the leftist PRD party. <PARAGRAPH> AMLO, as he is often known, is casting himself as more pro-business than last time around. He has promised not to nationalize private industries, but he is still considered much more pro-labor than the other candidates: the PAN’s Josefina Vazquez Mota and the PRI’s Enrique Pena Nieto, who propose loosening labor laws and courting more foreign investment. Lopez Obrador’s chances are slight, with polls showing only about a fifth of Mexicans support him.
A Shout-Out to GlobalPost’s Labor Series ‘Worked Over’ |  <PARAGRAPH> In its special report and ongoing series  Worked Over: The Global Decline of Labor Rights,  the online news outlet GlobalPost offers up a rich and insightful diversity of stories about complicated labor struggles and situations around the world. <PARAGRAPH> A May 3 piece details the lack of opportunities and jobs for youth in South Africa, who face a 51-percent unemployment rate and see trade unions standing in the way of government programs to create more jobs for youth, since unionists fear employers will use youth to replace older workers and undercut the power of unions. <PARAGRAPH> The story notes that South African young people are as a whole highly educated, and this, combined especially with the legacy of apartheid—which relegated almost all black people to manual labor —means they are loathe to take even skilled labor jobs because of the  degrading ‘hoers and tillers’ image their parents acquired under apartheid.  <PARAGRAPH> One story in the series highlights Spain’s overworked, underpaid and under-appreciated  army of one million waiters  as a symbol of the way labor law reforms billed as making Spain more competitive and reducing unemployment have backfired and divided workers: <PARAGRAPH> With food and drink so integral to Spain’s culture and services so important to its economy, waiters play a key role in society. But, [long-time water Mario] Castellanos explains, the relative drop in the profession’s wages, its unforgiving hours and the lack of opportunities to rise up through the ranks have undermined its social cache. And in many respects, the devaluation of waiting is representative of much broader changes in the Spanish labor market. <PARAGRAPH> Another recent story—the one that GlobalPost says was the impetus for the special report—talks about Bangladeshi workers suffering deadly fires and other dangers in factories where luxury American clothing is made for Tommy Hilfiger and other retailers. The story notes that workers are unionized in just 10 or 15 of the country’s thousands of garment factories. <PARAGRAPH> Bangladeshi garment-makers got international media attention after a December 2010 fire that killed 29 workers, and the industry and government promised sweeping changes. But, in fact, little has changed in terms of safety precautions or labor rights since the fire, according to GlobalPost, and repression of unions and worker organizing continues, as shown by the April murder of a prominent worker-leader. <PARAGRAPH> While China has continued to make news for sub-par labor conditions and child labor, the GlobalPost story posits that the situation is actually far more dire in Bangladesh. That’s where some of the most heated battles over future global labor rights likely lie. The May 1 story by Maher Sattar says: <PARAGRAPH> Finding that competing countries like China, India, and Vietnam are now too expensive, foreign brands are flocking to Dhaka to take advantage of the lowest wages in the world — less than half of the new minimum wage expected to be implemented in Cambodia, its closest competitor in terms of cheap labor. The typical Chinese wage minimum wage is now four to five times that of Bangladesh. <PARAGRAPH>  Bangladesh,  said industry veteran Zia Ahad,  is the cheapest place under the sun.  And according to labor activists, local factory owners, international retailers and the country’s government want to keep it that way. <PARAGRAPH> Several pieces in the report deal with labor rights in Colombia, including the lack of implementation of labor protections passed as a side agreement to the bilateral free trade pact that takes effect May 15; the ongoing violence against Colombian unionists; and the insidious role of so-called  labor co-ops.  <PARAGRAPH> The co-ops are a major point of contention because they often serve as glorified temp agencies providing cheap labor to farms and businesses. Yet their members are considered small-business  owners  and are therefore banned from joining unions. <PARAGRAPH> The explosive growth of the palm oil industry in Colombia—driven in part by demand for clean-burning biodiesel and cooking oil without transfat—and the industry's dominance by the non-union co-ops has seriously undermined the union movement as a whole in the country, the report explains. <PARAGRAPH> Sweating in the mid-morning heat, Eusebio Rodriguez leads an oxcart between towering palm trees to gather their purple-and-orange fruit, which is used to make palm oil. Rodriguez, who earns about $15 a day for harvesting a ton and a half of palm fruit, would like to sign up with the local union. That would mean perks, like sick leave and paid vacations, as well as a helmet and gloves to protect his body from the porcupine-like spines protruding from the fruit. Instead, Rodriguez belongs to a cooperative which offers almost no benefits or job security. <PARAGRAPH> GlobalPost describes its special report Worked Over thus: <PARAGRAPH> It's been called a  race to the bottom.  The hyper-accelerated movement of capital, jobs and resources from the world's international corporations — manufacturing, agriculture, service — to the lowest bidder. GlobalPost explores the human cost of such a race in an era of diminished expectations, broken promises and sleight of hand between governments, employers, unions and their workers. <PARAGRAPH> GlobalPost was founded in 2009 with the mission of producing web-only high-quality objective international news. It is a for-profit venture where every employee and correspondent is a  shareholder,  and funds are raised through advertising, syndication and subscriptions to exclusive content. I don't know what kind of pay, support or job security GlobalPost offers its employees and correspondents;like most new experiments that have arisen since the journalism crisis, it is probably too early to tell how it will fare in the long run. <PARAGRAPH> But the Worked Over series, which mixes concise and hard-hitting analysis with colorful writing and beautiful slide shows, provides an encouraging example of how  new media  digital journalism can improve coverage of otherwise overlooked, important international and labor issues—rather than eroding the depth and quality of coverage, as often seems to be the case with the shift to instant, hyper-local and celebrity news driven by the never-ending quest for web traffic.
Chicago Lunch Ladies Push for Fresh Food for Students…and Job Security |  <PARAGRAPH> School cafeteria food is the butt of many jokes. Despite national attention and student activism aimed at making school lunches tastier and healthier, and federal regulations mandating more fruits and veggies that take effect July 1, word on the ground is that it still leaves much to be desired, to say the least. Prepackaged highly processed salty and sugary foods still make up a disproportionate part of the menu. And ironically, students, teachers and “lunch ladies” around the country have reported, many of the healthier new additions to cafeteria menus are going uneaten. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The union UNITE HERE Local 1, which represents 3,200 cafeteria workers in Chicago public schools, says this is the case in the more than 600 schools where they work. And they say school officials could have much more success with adding healthier options to the menu that students will actually eat if they consider more input from the cafeteria workers who talk with and observe the kids on a daily basis. <PARAGRAPH> Such worker input is now enshrined in a contract agreement signed between the union and the Chicago Board of Education this week, a measure the union is calling “landmark.” It also addresses the school district’s plans to increasingly replace actual cooking in many schools with “warming kitchens” where pre-made food would be warmed up. <PARAGRAPH> The union says that according to the school district’s 2008 bid solicitation for pre-made food, 178 elementary schools currently have only warming kitchens and – as of that time – that was the plan for all new elementary schools. UNITE HERE says pre-made food is bad for kids and also for cafeteria workers' job security. UNITE HERE senior research analyst Kyle Schafer said that hundreds of jobs could have been at risk if the school system went through with its previous plans for more warming kitchens. <PARAGRAPH> Schafer told me: <PARAGRAPH> We’ve lost a number of jobs in recent years – obviously it takes less folks to heat a meal than to make a meal from scratch. That’s how the history of institutional food service in schools has been going -- the move to more and more processed foods has largely been one to cut labor costs, not because anyone thought the food was better for the kids. This is both a more traditional labor issue and also a food issue in terms of how it affects the kids. <PARAGRAPH> The new five-year contract agreement stipulates that no full kitchens will be replaced by warming kitchens in existing schools, and the school board must consult with the union—giving them a chance to organize an opposition campaign—if they plan to build a new school with only a warming kitchen. <PARAGRAPH> Barbara Collins, a union member with more than 20 years working in school cafeterias, told me the provisions for worker input in the new contract are crucial to letting workers give kids food that is both healthy and that they will actually eat. She noted that recent switches for health reasons – like a shift from fried to baked potatoes – have been  nearly pointless since many kids won’t eat baked potatoes. Baked chicken has fared better among students, she noted. Such input from the workers who cook 77,000 breakfasts and 280,000 lunches for Chicago students each day will now be considered in developing new menus. <PARAGRAPH> “It’s kind of hard to feed children nowadays—it’s hard to please them,” Collins told me. “Our committee is going to come together and see if we can come up with some good ideas for the children.” <PARAGRAPH> The contract agreement capped a months-long campaign including rallies in January and April and two reports:  Feeding Chicago's Kids the Food they Deserve  in January – based on a survey of 436 school kitchen workers, and “Kitchens Without Cooks.  As Collins indicated, the “Feeding” report found that 42 percent of workers thought students were not eating the new healthier menu items. <PARAGRAPH> Half of the respondents also said principals never eat cafeteria food – a finding that is not surprising but nonetheless is a bad sign. Perhaps most disturbingly, that study found that only 39 percent of cafeteria workers felt they could report concerns about food quality or safety to parents or others without fear of discipline, meaning almost two-thirds would likely stay silent even when they observed potential problems. <PARAGRAPH> A Chicago public schools teacher and parent, Sarah Wu, blogged anonymously -- fearing for her job -- for a year about horrendous cafeteria food. The Chicago Tribune described the offerings she consumed, often feeling sick as a result: <PARAGRAPH> …the surprising parade of plastic-wrapped, processed foods that appeared on her tray each day — from bagel dogs, popcorn chicken and Salisbury steak to green gelatin, peanut butter and jelly bars, and blue raspberry ice pops… <PARAGRAPH> Kitchens Without Cooks noted that nine out of 11 new elementary schools built since 2006 under a $1 billion program for modern schools include only warming kitchens. That means, the report says, that 81 percent of new elementary schools compared to 36 percent of older elementary schools serve frozen re-heated food. <PARAGRAPH> The report also quotes workers in various schools that have switched from cooking to “warming,” saying that students used to eat the food more when it was freshly-cooked. They say kids are more likely to throw away the food that resembles “TV dinners” – even if these meals are theoretically healthier “improvements” on the old fare. <PARAGRAPH> The Kitchens Without Cooks report quotes Tiffany Guynes, who is a kitchen worker at and also has a son attending the new Langston Hughes elementary school on the city’s south side. The study  says Guynes often packs a lunch for her son instead of letting him eat the food she serves the other students. <PARAGRAPH> The first day I walked into the cafeteria two questions came to my mind. Where is the stove? And where are the cooks? We don’t have either at Langston Hughes…I wouldn’t eat a lot of this food. If it’s not good enough for me, it’s not good enough for my son. <PARAGRAPH> The reports jibed with other media reports, including a November 2011 report by The Chicago Tribune that participation in school meal programs had dropped to 70 percent since healthier options were added, even though 82 percent of students were eligible for subsidized meals. <PARAGRAPH> Collins—whose four kids and 20-plus grandkids went to or are going to Chicago Public Schools —thinks the new contract is a start in helping both cafeteria workers and kids. She said: <PARAGRAPH> My crew, we take good care of the children. If a child is hungry they really can’t learn. If we feed them properly breakfast and lunch, they’ll do better. I want to see a smile on their face.
Newspaper disciplines copy editor for adding 'allegedly' to 'Obama was born in Hawaii' | The Montana Independent Record disciplined a copy editor for changing a line in an Associated Press story to read  Obama was allegedly born in Hawaii.  <paragraph>  The change appeared in the Sunday edition of the Helena newspaper in an AP story about President Barack Obama's visit to Asia. The line in the Independent Record read: “The Asia trip underscores Obama’s efforts to establish the United states as an Asia-Pacific power, a worldview defined by 21st century geopolitics but also by Obama’s personal identity as America’s first Pacific president. Obama was allegedly born in Hawaii.” <paragraph>  Retired AP staffer Tom Laceky, who worked in the Helena bureau for 28 years, pointed out the addition of  allegedly  in a letter to the editor on Tuesday  <hyperlink> . <paragraph>   'Allegedly born in Hawaii?' As if there is any doubt? That right-wing notion has been so thoroughly discredited that only Donald Trump and assorted other loonies still cling to it. Neither the AP nor -I hope - The Independent Record belongs in their company,  Laceky wrote. <paragraph> Another reader also wrote in <hyperlink>  to share their disappointment with the edit of the AP piece. <paragraph> In an editor's note <hyperlink> , the newspaper wrote that it was a  poor attempt at humor and a poor decision  and that  those responsible have been disciplined :    
NYT CEO addresses BBC sex abuse scandal | Mark Thompson — the incoming president and CEO of The New York Times Company who is currently facing questions about what he knew of the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse investigation — gave an interview to the paper Tuesday saying that  there is nothing to suggest that I acted inappropriately in the handling of this matter.   <paragraph>  Earlier on Tuesday, The New York Times’ public editor Margaret Sullivan  <hyperlink>  called for the publication to “thoroughly” and aggressively report the story surrounding the BBC “Newsnight” program about Savile that was killed last year while Thompson served as BBC director general. “The Times might start by publishing an in-depth interview with Mr. Thompson exploring what exactly he knew, and when, about what happened at the BBC,” she wrote.  <paragraph>  Thompson, who is scheduled to start his new job on Nov. 12, sat down for an interview at the Times building Tuesday <hyperlink>  with reporters Christine Haughney and David Carr and said he was not involved in canceling the investigation. <paragraph>  “I talked to senior management in BBC News and reported the conversation I had at the party and asked was there a problem,” he told the Times, noting that he was informed the story was dropped “for journalistic reasons.” <paragraph> “There is nothing to suggest that I acted inappropriately in the handling of this matter. I did not impede or stop the ‘Newsnight’ investigation, nor have I done anything else that could be construed as untoward or unreasonable,” he added. <paragraph> In her post, Sullivan asked, “How likely is it that he knew nothing? A director general of a giant media company is something like a newspaper’s publisher. Would a publisher be very likely to know if an investigation of one of its own people on sexual abuse charges had been killed? The answer to that is not as easy as it sounds.” <paragraph> Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Reuters interviewed Thompson about the Times' support of him in the wake of the scandal.   <paragraph>  “I do not believe there is anything that I've done in relation to this matter which should in anyway impinge on my abilities to fully discharge the responsibilities I'll have at the New York Times,  he told Reuters <hyperlink> .   All of my colleagues here in the management team of the New York Times have been very supportive on this and more broadly as I prepare to take on the job,  he said.  I've been very well supported as the incoming CEO of this company.  <paragraph>  As for Thompson’s other public statements on the investigation, on Oct. 13 he told the Times <hyperlink> ,  I was not notified or briefed about the Newsnight investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation.” Thompson added in his statement that “during my time as director general of the BBC, I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile.  But, as The Guardian noted <hyperlink> , Thompson’s spokesman told the London-based Times that the first time the former BBC director general heard about the investigation was at a party in late 2011 from a journalist. The journalist said words to the effect that 'You must be worried about the Newsnight investigation,’” the spokesman said, according to the Guardian.  This was the first that Mark had heard about the investigation. The journalist did not go into what Newsnight was investigating. Mark did not respond at the party but did mention the conversation to senior colleagues in BBC News and asked if there was a problem with the investigation. He was told that Newsnight had begun an investigation into Savile but had decided to drop it for journalistic reasons.” <paragraph>   The spokesman told the Guardian there was “no contradiction” between the two statements.  Mark told the New York Times he was not briefed on the Newsnight investigation. He wasn't. As he made clear yesterday he was only made aware of the allegations relating to Jimmy Savile when ITV published pre-broadcast publicity regarding their documentary in recent weeks,  the spokesman said. <paragraph> Thompson was at the BBC from 2004 to Sept. 2012.  
McCurry: Moderators have 'done a fine job' | Commission on Presidential Debates co-chair Mike McCurry on Monday praised the debates as “just what we wanted” and defended CNN’s Candy Crowley for “trying to move the program forward” in the last presidential showdown. <paragraph>  McCurry, former press secretary to President Bill Clinton, told Fox News’s Neil Cavuto that each of the moderators has “done a fine job.” <paragraph>  “The moderators have done a fine job, but when the two candidates are really talking about the issues and the moderator backs off and says this is your debate, because it’s about you and it’s not about me, that is the ideal,” McCurry said on “Your World with Neil Cavuto.” <paragraph> Cavuto then asked McCurry to address the dust-up over Crowley’s intervention on the Libya question. <paragraph> “Someone said, ‘Well, she unnecessarily was fact checking.’ My view of it, having sat there and I’ve heard her since, is that she got to a point where both candidates were just kind of repeating the same thing and she was saying, ‘Okay, he said it, so let’s move on,’” McCurry said. “She was trying to move the program forward. That was my opinion.” <paragraph> When Cavuto asked McCurry if that was her designated role in the debate, the commission co-chair replied, “We were very elastic in how we described the role. We said it was her job to facilitate a discussion.”   
Frontiers of campaign advertising | A new campaign ad making the rounds in a New York congressional race forces Internet users to type a candidate specific phrase — “right to choose” — if they want to change their password. <paragraph> The ad from Democrat Julian Schreibman’s media consultant J.J. Balaban for the NY-19 race against Republican Rep. Chris Gibson, functions like a CAPTCHA test to ensure that it’s a real person making the request rather than a computer program or spammer. In this case, before certain New York users can move to the reset password page, they’ll see the Schreibman ad and will have to enter the phrase connected with it. <paragraph>  The ad states “Chris Gibson opposes a woman’s ‘right to choose’” and asks the user to enter the quoted text — “right to choose.” The user cannot move on to change their password until they correctly enter the phrase, Balaban said. <paragraph>  “We have never heard of anyone doing this kind of advertising before, but it seemed like an innovative way to bolster what we are doing on TV that is uniquely targeted,” Balaban told POLITICO in an email. “We all learned in school that the best way to remember something is to write it down ... again and again. “<paragraph> The Web ad is running in “ZIP codes with high persuadable voters” on sites that include aol.com, NASDAQ.com, BHG.com and AmericanGreetings.com, he said. The campaign is centered around a TV spot  <hyperlink>  about women and health care that features several women speaking about Gibson’s policies. One woman states, “Gibson opposes a woman’s right to choose  and another says, “That’s not moderate, Mr. Gibson. That’s just wrong.” <paragraph>  The Web ad is  a unique tool the requires voters to write the issue we want them to remember,” Balaban said. <paragraph>“We're always looking for new ways of trying to get our client's message across, particularly in a year like this year in which there will be a high voter turnout. Also, a majority of NY19 is in the priciest TV market in the nation — New York City — so this is a cost-efficient way to support what we are doing on other mediums,  he added.  
McMahon won't release Social Security specifics... because of the media | Connecticut GOP Senate candidate Linda McMahon on Thursday said the media is the reason she has not released any specifics about her Social Security plan, saying that reporters “bash” and demagogue any proposals,  according to a report. <paragraph>  During Thursday’s debate with Rep. Chris Murphy, McMahon said she has not discussed specifics about her Social Security plan thanks to the press, CT News Junkie reported  <hyperlink>. <paragraph>  “I’ve not talked about specifics when I’ve been on the campaign trail because they get demagogued and you have no opportunity at all when you go in and put the issues on the table to discuss them,” McMahon said. <paragraph>  After the debate ended, McMahon doubled down on the charge, pointing out to reporters that she was referring to them in that statement. <paragraph>  “Thanks to all of you folks in the media, you’re the ones who primarily do it and bash any of the suggestions that might be made to improve the Social Security, Medicare,” she said, according to CT News Junkie. <paragraph>  McMahon’s office has not yet responded to request for comment from POLITICO.  
Mitchell: Men at MSNBC make more money | <video> <paragraph> During an interview Thursday, Mitt Romney senior adviser Barbara Comstock told Andrea Mitchell <hyperlink> that “we know here at MSNBC the guys get paid more  — and the MSNBC host replied, “We certainly do.” <paragraph> Mitchell and Comstock were discussing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act <hyperlink> on “Andrea Mitchell Reports” when the Romney adviser said MSNBC has issues with fair pay for men and women. “I mean for Lilly Ledbetter, this was not just a legal issue,” Mitchell said. “This was the fact that she was not permitted to sue for equal pay because the statute had ran out and the law said if you didn't know the men you were working with were making more money, which many of us don't know, we don't have access to those confidential —“ <paragraph>   Also on POLITICO: Equal pay surfaces in debate  <hyperlink>  “We know here at MSNBC the guys get paid more,” Comstock jumped in, laughing. “We know that.” <paragraph>   “We certainly do,” Mitchell replied. <paragraph>  “So this is one of the places where you need to be a little bit more public with it,” Comstock said. <paragraph>  As the interview wrapped, Comstock again brought up the issue of fair pay at MSNBC. <paragraph>  “You get after MSNBC here, Andrea,” Comstock said. “Make sure the women make the same here.” <paragraph>  “Thank you very much,” Mitchell replied. <paragraph> UPDATE:  4:03 p.m. : Andrea Mitchell tells POLITICO, “I was referring to the industry as a whole. This remark has been taken out of context.” <paragraph>  MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski adds,  We take this issue very seriously and I can tell you that we're proud of the gender equality at MSNBC.   
Paper reports McGovern dead, apologizes | The Sioux Falls Argus Leader apologized Thursday for posting a story inaccurately announcing that former Sen. George McGovern had died. <paragraph> The paper — in McGovern’s home state of South Dakota — said the story was accidently published on the Argus Leader website due to a technical error. <paragraph>  “A software company that searches the content of websites operated by the Gannett Corporation, including the Argus Leader, detected an unpublished story in the Argus Leader content management system and created a link to the McGovern story without permission,” the paper wrote <hyperlink> . “That link was automatically placed on an unrelated story today on the Argus Leader’s website, which a reader then posted to the social media site Twitter, which was seen and distributed by other users of Twitter and other social media sites.” The paper got in touch with the reader and the posting was deleted. The Argus Leader also deleted the story and had the link broken. <paragraph>  “Argus Leader Media apologizes to the McGovern family and our readers for this error,” the paper said. <paragraph>  McGovern’s family announced this week that the 1972 Democratic presidential candidate was admitted to a hospice in Sioux Falls, and his daughter Ann issued a statement Wednesday saying that the 90-year-old is “no longer responsive” in hospice care.   
Seattle Times Co. buys full-page campaign ad | The Seattle Times Co. purchased a full-page ad in Wednesday’s newspaper supporting Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna. <paragraph>  The ad is part of an independent-expenditure campaign with no coordination between the paper and the campaign, according to a statement from The Seattle Times. The ad appears on page B6 and says McKenna is a “choice that will make us all proud” and praises the candidate’s time as Washington state’s attorney general. The advertisement states that “no candidate authorized this ad. It is paid for by The Seattle Times Company.” <paragraph>  The point of the ad, according to the company's press release? It's all part of an attempt to convince political campaigns of just how valuable advertising in The Times could be. <paragraph>  “In recent years, political consultants have not been placing many campaign ads in The Seattle Times, and we think they’re missing out on the most effective way to reach voters in the Puget Sound region,” said Alan Fisco, executive vice president, revenue and new products for The Seattle Times said in a statement.  “We decided to try to tap into this important source of advertising revenue by demonstrating how effective advertising with The Times can be.” <paragraph>  The company will also run a similar campaign supporting Referendum 74, which would legalize same-sex marriage. Fisco said that the two campaigns are a  a business decision that is completely separate from journalism functions of the newspaper. The ads will be clearly identified as ads and there is no intersection between the advertising and our editorial commentary or news reporting.  <paragraph>   Seattle Times executive editor David Boardman told The Seattle Times’ Jim Brunner in an email that “the News Department was not part of the discussion or the decision to do this,  according to Brunner's blog post. <paragraph>  The press release states that  in formulating the advertising initiative, The Times decided to feature one statewide candidate and one statewide issue for which polling showed to be fairly close races  and the races were chosen because the Times had editorialized in support of each one. <paragraph> Jay Inslee spokesperson Sterling Clifford blasted the decision to run the ad, telling POLITICO that “all Washingtonians should be disappointed that the state's largest newspaper has chosen to sacrifice its credibility as an independent news source.” <paragraph>  McKenna’s campaign has yet to return a request for comment. <paragraph> The Seattle Times editorial board endorsed McKenna <hyperlink>  and the same-sex marriage referendum.  UPDATE  4:20 p.m.  <paragraph>   The Seattle Times' spokesperson Jill Mackie told POLITICO that the paper's  editorial page editor and executive  news  editor were briefed as a heads up on the concept after the decision to proceed was made.  <paragraph>  The McKenna ad  effort is scheduled to run at a value of just over $75,000 between today and the election. A similar value in in-kind space will be donated to the R74  Marriage Equality  campaign,  Mackie wrote in an e-mail.   
Ingraham, Todd debate Libya coverage | Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and NBC’s Chuck Todd on Tuesday debated whether or not the White House press corps has pushed the Obama administration hard enough for answers to the violence in Libya. <paragraph>  Ingraham criticized the press for what she called its lack of “outcry” and “desire” to get to the bottom of the situation in Benghazi. <paragraph>  “Four Americans are dead, the president has failed to do a press conference on this,” Ingraham said on her radio show. “…You’re in that briefing room every day, and they send out Jay Carney every day, and meanwhile, the president has given interviews to ‘The Michael Yo! Show,’ has spent time with ‘The View,’ has spent time in Vegas, has spent time on the trail doing all these Hollywood events, and he does not have time to do a full-blown press conference on what happened when, and why the false narrative was sold when four Americans are dead.” <paragraph>  “And my question to you as one of the critical reporters — and we look to you, we really look to you for this — why, where is the outcry from the White House press corps and the desire to answer these questions?” Ingraham said. <paragraph>   “There is a ton of desire,” Todd replied, adding that “the fact that the president hasn’t sat down with a member of the White House press corps for any extended interview for over a year is their business. It’s certainly something that is not popular in the White House press room, if you will. But at the end of the day, media whining about access gets us, you know, it’s not so popular on either side.” <paragraph>  odd then addressed the congressional hearing on Libya, saying, “Let’s not pretend both sides aren’t playing a little politics here.” <paragraph>  “You think the intention was 100 percent to get to the bottom of this, or do you think there was some politics involved?” he asked. <paragraph>  “Well, this is what I will say to you,” Ingraham said. “Since apparently the White House press corps cannot get answers from this administration, I think the Republicans on Capitol Hill were figuring maybe they can get some answers.” <paragraph>   “Well, they have subpoena power, I don’t,” Todd jumped in. <paragraph>  You don’t have subpoena power, but you’re in that White House press briefing every day,” Ingraham said. <paragraph>   “Look, I know beating up on us is popular and it’s easy to do, but there’s only so much. We ask these questions every single day,” Todd said. <paragraph>  The idea that the press isn’t covering what happened in Libya is “unfair,” Todd told Ingraham. After all, he said, the reason the public finally has heard a play-by-play from the State Dept. is because of the press corps’  browbeating.  <paragraph>  “The fact is, the reason why we finally got a full tick-tock from the State Dept. is that every single day a bunch of us were calling to the State Dept., 'how come we don’t have a tick-tock? What happened here? What is your version? Nobody seems to understand, nobody seems to be able to explain it.' It takes a lot of browbeating,” he said. <paragraph>     
CQ Roll Call names new editorial director |  CQ Roll Call announced Monday that Susan Benkelman has officially become the publication’s editorial director. <paragraph>  Benkelman was named interim editorial director after Mike Mills left the post earlier this year, and CQ Roll Call executive vice president and managing director Keith White told staffers in an email that Benkelman starts immediately. <paragraph>  “Her deep understanding of our unique brand of congressional news and information coupled with her proven track record in transforming products will position us well as we continue to push ahead as the leader in digital news and information on Congress and public policy,” White wrote in an email obtained by POLITICO. <paragraph>  Benkelman joined CQ Roll Call in 1997 as social policy editor and later became assistant managing editor before joining The Washington Post for a year. She returned to the publication in 2001 as editor of the magazine and then was appointed executive editor for news, White wrote. <paragraph>  “Most recently, working closely with Meg Hargreaves, she has overseen the merging of our print dailies and the restructuring of the CQ Roll Call newsroom,” he noted.
