House Dems dominated by 4 states |   <paragraph>  The University of Minnesota’s  <hyperlink>  Smart Politics blog looks at the composition of the 113th Congress and reports that the House Democratic Caucus will be dominated by two big blue states:  <paragraph>  " Californians and New Yorkers will comprise a record percentage of the Democratic caucus when the 113th Congress convenes in January at nearly 30 percent.  <paragraph>  Although gains by Democrats were modest in 2012 U.S. House races — netting eight seats nationwide — the delegations from two coastal states still managed to increase their ever-growing influence on the party.  <paragraph>  For despite the State of New York losing two seats due to reapportionment after the 2010 U.S. Census, the Democratic Party saw the percentage of its caucus from the Empire State and California delegations increase to an all-time high — now just shy of 30 percent of the 201 seats it will hold across the country in January.  <paragraph>  A Smart Politics analysis of 83 general election cycles dating back to 1850 finds that the Democratic Party now composes a larger percentage of Californians and New Yorkers in the U.S. House than at any point since California joined the Union."  <paragraph>  If you add in Illinois and Massachusetts, then 40 percent of the Democratic Caucus hails from just four blue states.  <paragraph>  There’s a danger, of course, when such a high proportion of members hail from just a few states. As the GOP is learning from its overreliance on the South, it’s easy to develop a tin ear when a party is too concentrated in states where the political climate is unrepresentative of the nation as a whole.
The GOP's 2012 diversity disaster | <picture>   <paragraph>  Florida Republican Rep. Allen West’s   <hyperlink>  concession Tuesday makes it official: The 2012 election was a disaster for the GOP’s efforts to diversify the face of the party.  <paragraph>  The number of African-American Republicans in Congress, which stood to double thanks to several highly competitive candidates, was instead cut in half. In addition to West’s reelection loss, top House prospects Vernon Parker in Arizona and Mia Love in Utah also fell short, leaving Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina as the lone black GOP House member in the 113th Congress.  <paragraph>  In a year when a record number of Hispanics were elected to Congress, Republicans also ended up losing two of their already small contingent: Reps. Francisco Canseco of Texas and David Rivera of Florida, both of whom were defeated in their bids for a second term.  <paragraph>  In addition, the party failed to elect one of its most promising Hispanic candidates, former California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado, and saw GOP Gov. Luis Fortuño defeated in Puerto Rico.  <paragraph>  In the Senate, which will have a record number of women next year, the number of female Republican senators declined by one. While Republican Deb Fischer was elected to Nebraska’s open Senate seat, five other female GOP nominees lost — placing the number of GOP women in the Senate at 4.  <paragraph>  Meanwhile, Democrats elected 4 new women and re-elected 6 female Senate incumbents, giving the party 16 female senators.  <paragraph>  There was one promising sign this year for the GOP amid the lost opportunities: The election of Ted Cruz to an open Texas Senate seat. His victory means the party now boasts Hispanic senators in two of the nation’s largest states (the other is Florida’s Marco Rubio).  <paragraph>  Since the GOP can also point to two Hispanic governors (Democrats have none), Republicans are now arguably better positioned than Democrats to put a Hispanic on the presidential ticket in 2016.
The power of Calif.'s ethnic vote|   <paragraph>  Mitt Romney lost California by a landslide this year, but exit polls revealed he made big gains with one important demographic: white voters. In 2008, white Californians voted 52 to 46 percent for President Obama. In 2012, they flipped and voted 53-45 for Romney.  <paragraph>  In the end, though, it made almost no difference. Romney improved over John McCain’s weak 2008 performance by just 1 percentage point.  <paragraph>  Mark DiCamillo, director of California’s Field Poll,  <hyperlink>  explains the tectonic forces that made Romney’s gains largely irrelevant:  <paragraph> " When I first began polling at The Field Poll in the late 1970s, the influence of ethnic voters [Latinos, Asian Americans and African Americans] on California election outcomes was less, and top-of-the-ticket races were typically more competitive affairs, with each party winning their share of the elections. For example, in the 16 elections for president, U.S. Senate and governor between 1978 and 1994, Republican candidates won nine times, while Democrats won seven times.  <paragraph>  The 1994 election marked a turning point, as ethnic voter participation began its ascent…  <paragraph>  A comparison of Field Poll estimates of the composition of the state's registered voters in 1994 to what it is today illustrates the dramatic effect that the growth in ethnic voters has had on the electorate over the past 18 years.  <paragraph>  In 1994 there were 14.7 million registered voters in California. Today there are 18.2 million voters.  <paragraph>  Of the 3.5 million voter increase over this period, about 3 million — or nearly 90 percent of it — came from Latino and Asian American voters."  <paragraph>  This year’s exit polls suggest a dramatic change in the composition of the California electorate in just the past four years: The white share of the vote was 63 percent in 2008, then dropped to 55 percent in 2012.  <paragraph>  Demographic change isn’t the only story here. DiCamillo concludes that the best explanation for the growth in Latino, Asian-American and African-American support for Democratic candidates relates to their view of the role of government.  <paragraph>  While California's white non-Hispanics are evenly divided on whether the government should do more to solve the nation's problems, ethnic voters believe that government should be doing more by nearly 2 to 1.
The war on Charlie Crist |   <paragraph>   <picture>  <paragraph>  As former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist looks more and more like a Democratic prospect for governor in 2014, the Florida GOP is ramping up its efforts to damage his political brand:  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  Tthe Associated Press: “ When Crist says something nice about President Barack Obama, the state GOP immediately shoots out a press release with something not so nice Crist said about Obama when he was a Republican. If Crist endorses a Democratic candidate, the party reminds people Crist used to say he was a Ronald Reagan Republican… “I just think Charlie Crist is bad for the state of Florida,” said state GOP Chairman Lenny Curry. “He’s someone who’s trying to recreate himself. These are serious times. At any level, we don’t want to see Charlie Crist back in office, particularly in a position of leadership. It wouldn’t be good for Florida, regardless of your ideology.” The idea is this: defeat Crist before he can re-emerge as a political candidate with a D next to his name. The unusual part is Crist isn’t a candidate and the attacks began before the 2012 election was decided. It breaks traditional election strategy for a party to begin airing campaign ads for the next election cycle while in the middle of another. “I don’t recall it ever being done,” said David Johnson, a Tallahassee-based Republican political consultant. “It is unusual and it is unprecedented, but so is Charlie Crist.” ”  <paragraph>  It’s hard to overstate the level of disdain many Florida Republicans have for Crist, so in one sense, the Crist-bashing isn’t a surprise.  <paragraph>  But there’s some risk in an over-the-top approach — the more the GOP attacks Crist, who hasn’t even registered as a Democrat yet, the more he could look like a sympathetic character to his prospective party.  <paragraph>  The track record for recent high-profile party-switchers isn’t great: Former Alabama Rep. Parker Griffith lost by a wide margin in a 2010 GOP primary following his switch from the Democratic Party, and former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter was also rejected by his new party in a 2010 Democratic primary after he switched from the GOP side.  <paragraph>  There’s one big difference, though, between those party-switchers and Crist. Griffith and Specter both ran for reelection in the same election cycle that they switched parties, leaving them little time or opportunity to establish a trusting relationship with their new parties.  <paragraph>  Crist, on the other hand, will have plenty of distance from the Republican Party by 2014, and lots of time to do the necessary spadework with the Democratic grass-roots. By then, four years will have passed since he left the GOP. He’s already begun the process of generating political goodwill by supporting Democratic candidates and emerging as a prominent backer of President Obama — and by attracting the ire of the Florida GOP.
Obama's big county blowouts | <picture> Courtesy of Larry J. Sabato's Crystal Ball  <paragraph>  Here’s a stat that provides a measure of how thoroughly the GOP presidential ticket got thrashed in the “urban areas” Paul Ryan referred to: Mitt Romney lost 44 of the nation’s top 50 most populous counties on Election Day, a significant fall off from George W. Bush’s 2000 performance in those places.  <paragraph>  According to an analysis by Larry Sabato’s   <hyperlink>  Crystal Ball website, Bush won 16 big counties in his first bid, compared to just 6 for Romney. The majority of those counties weren’t close in 2012 — President Barack Obama won more than 55 percent of the vote in 34 of them.  <paragraph>  Many of the top 50 counties include big cities and have majority minority populations, so the results sketch out the full contours of the GOP’s weakness in urban America and among minority voters.  <paragraph>  The Crystal Ball research suggests the problem is getting worse in many places, not better. Consider Los Angeles County, the nation’s single largest county. In 1988, Michael Dukakis won 52-47 there. By 2000, the margin was 64-32 for Al Gore. This year, Obama won 69-29.  <paragraph>  Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County is a similar story: 59-40 Dukakis in 1988, 63-33 Gore in 2000 and 69-30 Obama in 2012.  <paragraph>  Even the big counties that once favored the GOP are drifting out of the party’s orbit as they diversify.  <paragraph>  In 1988, Charlotte’s Mecklenburg County gave George H.W. Bush 59 percent of the vote. By 2000, the GOP advantage in North Carolina’s most populous county was down to 51-48. This year, Barack Obama won 61-38.  <paragraph>  Then there’s Orange County, Calif. — the onetime conservative stronghold that Ronald Reagan called the place “where good Republicans go to die.”  <paragraph>  GOP presidential performance there declined from 68 percent in 1988 to 53 percent in 2012. The good news for Republicans? That 53 percent represents an uptick from John McCain’s 50 percent in 2008.
An early abortion rights test for Dems |   <paragraph>  The Democratic Party’s full and unyielding embrace of abortion rights in 2012 – a subtle but conspicuous repositioning – is about to be tested in a contest for the top Democratic slot on the powerful Appropriations Committee between Reps. Nita Lowey and Marcy Kaptur.  <paragraph>  From a report Sunday in  <hyperlink>  The Hill: “ A key factor in the race is abortion. Lowey’s camp argues she is more reliable in preventing anti-abortion rights legislation from being inserted into appropriations bills. Kaptur’s camp notes she has opposed riders defunding Planned Parenthood. Lowey, her office acknowledges, is emphasizing her pro-abortion rights positions. According to NARAL, Lowey has a 100 percent ranking on abortion-related issues, while Kaptur is “mixed-choice” at 70 percent. ”  <paragraph>  While support for abortion rights isn’t the only issue at play in the competition for the ranking Democratic position on the spending panel, the debate provides a window into the priorities and current thinking in the caucus.  <paragraph>  When Republicans chose a new chairman after the 2010 election, the battle lines were drawn over pork-barreling practices and appropriations reform.
Georgia GOPers fall short |  <paragraph>  The Georgia Tipsheet blog   <hyperlink>  notes that the House GOP leadership elections were a flop for Georgia, which saw two members of its delegation fall short. <paragraph>  Rep. Tom Price lost to Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers Wednesday in his bid to become conference chairman while Rep. Tom Graves lost Thursday in his attempt to head the Republican Study Committee.  <paragraph>  While it’s a blow to Georgia interests, the outcomes are probably a net plus for the House GOP in the wake of an election that underscored the party’s weakness in competing with women and in regions outside the South.  <paragraph>  Had Price and Graves won the posts they vied for, top House leadership would have consisted of 5 white males, three of them from the South. The new team will now have one woman at the table, and will have more regional balance – two from the West (McMorris Rodgers and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California), a Midwesterner in Speaker John Boehner and two Southerners, Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and Republican Study Committee Chair Steve Scalise of Louisiana.  <paragraph>  Still, the GOP's congressional wing has a ways to go in presenting a different face to voters. As POLITICO's Manu Raju and Jake Sherman   <hyperlink>  report, the House and Senate GOP chose four women lawmakers out of 14 spots for senior leadership positions.
Scott Brown's comeback tour |  <picture>  <paragraph>  He might have lost his Senate seat last week, but Scott Brown is still very much in the game.  <paragraph>  Between the 2014 Massachusetts governor’s race and the swirling rumors regarding a possible Cabinet position for Sen. John Kerry, several promising   <hyperlink>  opportunities might soon present themselves to Brown.  <paragraph>  In a media availability Tuesday in Washington, the senator dodged questions about his future.  <paragraph>  “I have a job to do right now and there is not an opening right now for governor, nor is there an opening for senator,”  <hyperlink>  Brown said. “But there is an opening for a dad and a husband and that’s the role that I want to play.”  <paragraph>  Given his track record — a giant special election upset and a respectable loss in his bid to win a full term — and the Massachusetts GOP’s thin bench, Brown has far more leverage than the typical election loser in choosing an avenue of return.  <paragraph>  If he’s interested in returning to the Senate, however, Brown is looking at a daunting scenario. If Kerry steps down, Brown would have to run next year in a 2013 Senate special election, followed by the regularly scheduled 2014 election for the full six-year term. That would make four grueling statewide campaigns in five years in a heavily Democratic state — the 2010 special, the 2012 general election against Elizabeth Warren, a 2013 special and a 2014 general.
Dem. Senate incumbents outpaced Obama | <picture> Image courtesy of PoliticsPA  <paragraph>  The website   <hyperlink>  PoliticsPA crunches the numbers and finds that Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, whose lead appeared to be narrowing late in the campaign, ended up outperforming President Barack Obama nearly everywhere in Pennsylvania — including Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Casey wasn’t alone in running ahead of the president: Every Senate Democratic incumbent on the ballot, with the exception of Maryland’s Ben Cardin, outpaced Obama this year. So did a handful of challengers, including Tim Kaine of Virginia, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.  <paragraph>  None ran quite so far ahead of the ticket as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who was 25 percentage points ahead of the president and won 160,000 more votes than Obama — a stunning number for such a small state.  <paragraph>  How weak was Obama’s performance in West Virginia? Not only did he lose all 55 counties, he even won fewer votes than Manchin’s GOP opponent, John Raese.
Romney's Oakland County blues |   <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  The Detroit Free Press captures Republican hand-wringing after another presidential loss in Michigan’s Oakland County, a one-time GOP suburban stronghold that again eluded the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  Without the county, the state’s second-most populous after Detroit’s Wayne County, Mitt Romney had no chance of carrying the state where he was born.  <paragraph>  " Locally, Oakland County voters gave Democrats four of the six countywide offices — prosecutor, treasurer, clerk and water resources commissioner — and successfully recalled Republican Troy Mayor Janice Daniels, a tea party supporter who was targeted after anti-gay comments and her promise to derail federal funding for a transit center in the city …  <paragraph>  "I think it surprised a lot of people who didn't really recognize the county they thought they knew: We're not the rock-ribbed Republican stronghold that we were 20 years ago," [former Oakland County GOP chairman Paul Welday] said. "And look, we had six white guys running for the countywide offices. We don't always look and sound as much like the voters around us as we should.  <paragraph>  "We've got to become more relevant to voters of all stripes."  <paragraph>  The numbers back up Welday's assertion. Demographics helped push Oakland blue. As Detroit and Wayne County lost population, Oakland County's population grew more diverse, with the number of minority residents growing by nearly 10percent from 2000 to 2010, literally helping to change the face of the county's electorate."  <paragraph>  Romney’s local connections make his 54-46 loss there an especially bitter pill to swallow — he grew up in Oakland County, and his father served as governor of Michigan.  <paragraph>  While he ran 4 points ahead of John McCain’s pace in 2008, the fact that a candidate as well-suited for the area as Romney couldn’t win there is a telling sign of how damaged the GOP brand is in many of the Midwestern and Northeastern suburbs.  <paragraph>  While exit polls report Romney carried the suburbs 50-48 overall, he still fell short in many of the populous suburban counties that reliably powered GOP victories for decades — places like Oakland County.
The ever more solid South |   <paragraph>  Election Day was a downer for Republicans in most states, but not Alabama. Mitt Romney won by more than 20 points there and the GOP picked off the last remaining statewide Democrat. <paragraph>  What little Democratic strength remains in Alabama is concentrated at the county courthouse level.  <paragraph>  From the   <hyperlink>  Associated Press report: “ After losing their last statewide elected office in the Nov. 6 election, Alabama Democrats still can console themselves with one statistic: At least they still hold a majority of the elected offices in county courthouses statewide. … There were contested races for 213 county offices, with 149 having been held by Democrats and 64 by Republicans. Republicans won 67 of the seats that had been held by Democrats, and Democrats won 22 of the seats held by Republicans, according to the state Republican Party. Democrats were successful in urban counties with significant African-American populations. In Montgomery County, the son of Joe Reed, the chairman of the Democratic Party's black wing, defeated a longtime Republican probate judge. Democrats swept all county races in Jefferson County and reelected a Democratic probate judge in Tuscaloosa County against tough GOP opposition. The GOP made inroads into some rural counties as well as counties in northwest Alabama that had always been Democratic strongholds. ”   <paragraph>  The South, as a whole, was largely resistant to the Democratic winds last week. The GOP now controls every legislature in the South, and every governorship except Arkansas. Republicans also managed to hold every one of its House and Senate seats in the region on Election Day – and even managed to pick up a few House seats.
A GOP call for reform in Minnesota | <paragraph>  A critical part of the GOP’s path forward is a reexamining of process — in other words, looking closely at the institutional factors that are generating unelectable nominees.  <paragraph>  In Minnesota, where first-term Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar won a landslide victory over largely unknown Republican state Rep. Kurt Bills, former state GOP Executive Director Ben Golnik   <hyperlink>  calls for an end to the complicated candidate-endorsement process that helped deliver the nomination to Bills.  <paragraph>  “ For Republicans, the endorsing convention is composed of about 2,000 delegates from around the state. To win endorsement, a candidate must receive 60 percent of the vote. Essentially, 1,200 delegates pick the Republican candidate for statewide office. How were these 1,200 delegates selected? First, Republicans had to attend precinct caucuses on a Tuesday night in the dead of winter. These caucus meetings could last for a couple hours as attendees elect delegates to local conventions. The local conventions are held a few weeks after the precinct caucuses, typically on Saturdays, and last several hours. At these conventions, delegates to the state convention are elected. Finally, a state convention (with a $75 registration fee per delegate in 2012) is held on a Saturday in the late spring. Many delegates must travel hundreds of miles and pay for a couple of nights in a hotel. The actual endorsement process can last the entire day and late into the night until a candidate reaches the 60 percent threshold. This costly, time-consuming process discourages involvement from a broader group of Republicans. For families with young children, it requires money for babysitters. For small-business owners, it requires significant time away from their jobs. With the complicated process, a well-organized minority can defeat a poorly organized majority. At the Republican caucuses in February 2012, Ron Paul received about one-quarter of the votes cast. At the Republican state convention a few months later, Paul supporters represented more than half of the delegates. Bills, a teacher and first-term state representative, was selected by the ardent Paul supporters as the U.S. Senate candidate. As Republicans look to run serious challengers to Dayton and U.S. Sen. Al Franken in 2014, strong candidates must be recruited — from both inside the existing structure and from outside. Prospective candidates should skip the endorsement process and run in a primary, rather than focusing solely on the endorsement process. Credible candidates must be able to demonstrate an ability to raise money and communicate a message to a broader audience than 2,000 Republican delegates. ”  <paragraph>  Calls to reform the nominating process in states like Minnesota aren’t new, but it’s possible they’ll take on an increased urgency in the wake of two successive national election cycles marked by unusually weak Republican general election candidates.  <paragraph>  The problem, of course, is that pure primary elections aren’t a cure-all. Primaries have produced the most notorious GOP nominees of the past two cycles — the ones who essentially handed over seats to Democratic candidates.
Rasmussen explains |   <paragraph>  Rasmussen Reports, the prolific automated pollster whose projections fell far from the mark Tuesday,  <hyperlink>  explains what went wrong: “ Our final daily presidential tracking poll showed Romney at 49% and Obama at 48%. Instead, the president got 50% of the vote and Romney 48%. We were disappointed that our final results were not as close to the final result as they had been in preceding elections. There was a similar pattern in the state polls. For example, in Ohio we projected a tie at 49% but the president reached 50% of the vote and the challenger got just 48%. Although every individual result in the battleground states was within the margin of error, the numbers we projected were consistently a bit more favorable for Romney than the actual results. A preliminary review indicates that one reason for this is that we underestimated the minority share of the electorate. In 2008, 26% of voters were non-white. We expected that to remain relatively constant. However, in 2012, 28% of voters were non-white. That was exactly the share projected by the Obama campaign. It is not clear at the moment whether minority turnout increased nationally, white turnout decreased, or if it was a combination of both. The increase in minority turnout has a significant impact on the final projections since Romney won nearly 60% of white votes while Obama won an even larger share of the minority vote. Another factor may be related to the generation gap. It is interesting to note that the share of seniors who showed up to vote was down slightly from 2008 while the number of young voters was up slightly. Pre-election data suggested that voters older than 65 were more enthusiastic about voting than they had been four years earlier so the decline bears further examination. ”  <paragraph>  As mea culpas go, this one is a little thin. While Rasmussen wasn’t alone in misreading the composition of the 2012 electorate, and it’s true that all the firm’s battleground state polls were within the 4-point margin of error, there are a few clunkers in there. In Wisconsin, for example, Rasmussen was the only public pollster reporting a 49-49 tie — in the final two weeks, the five other pollsters in the field there pegged Obama’s lead at 3 and 9 percentage points. The actual result was a 53-46 Obama win.  <paragraph>  Colorado was similarly errant. In the final round of polls, Rasmussen was the one reporting the biggest Romney lead — 50-47 — but the outcome was 51-46 Obama.  <paragraph>  Rasmussen got a few states right — placing Obama in the lead in Nevada and New Hampshire and Romney ahead in North Carolina — but simply getting the winner correct in 3 of 9 battleground states isn’t going to win over the many detractors who regularly dismiss the firm’s polls for their often overly rosy GOP predictions.
The GOP's big city problem | <picture> <paragraph>  There’s at least one ray of hope for the GOP in Mitt Romney’s loss Tuesday: Exit polls show he won back the suburbs from President Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Romney won the suburbs 50 percent to 48 percent, recapturing them after Obama won the crabgrass frontier by the same margin in 2008.  <paragraph>  It’s an important symbolic win for the GOP since, with few exceptions, the suburbs have been the province of the Republican Party in post-war presidential elections.  <paragraph>  But Romney’s victory margin in the suburbs wasn’t by nearly enough, and it underscores a problem confronting the GOP. While the suburbs powered the GOP for decades, they also created a false sense of security — and a political dependency — that threatens the party’s future in an era of when most of the older suburbs are firmly in the Democratic column and many of the newer ones are up for grabs.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  Sommer Mathis of the Atlantic Cities website puts it succinctly:  “Republicans can never again concede all of the urban vote to the Democrats…  <paragraph>  The math of assuming cities will go to Democrats and thus not bothering to craft a message aimed at the people who live there is just a losing game going forward for Republicans. And it's only going to get worse as urban populations increase and become more concentrated. ”  <paragraph>  Even if you don’t buy the recent analysis that cities are growing faster than the suburbs, the big city Democratic landslides (71% in 2000, 60% in 2004, 70% in 2008, and now 69% in 2012 in cities of over 500,000) are a serious issue for the GOP in an era when the suburbs are an unreliable constituency. <paragraph>  A case in point is Pennsylvania, where Romney ran more competitively than John McCain in the Big Four suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia — and even won one of them by a razor-close margin — but was still swamped by Philadelphia, which delivered a Democratic margin in the neighborhood of 465,000 votes.  <paragraph>  The GOP practice of ignoring the cities made political sense for decades, when the suburbs and urban America were at odds. The GOP was unquestionably the party of the suburbs — it celebrated the suburban way of life in a way that Democrats did not because of their urban base — and the party presented itself as a bulwark against the crime and dysfunction of the Democratic central cities. But as the cities came under a new generation of leadership in the 1990s and the suburbs began to mature and diversify — not to mention share some of the same problems as the central cities — the GOP’s grip began to loosen.  <paragraph>  There were other important factors in play as well — Democrats began to compete more aggressively for the suburban vote and many suburbs dislodged themselves from the GOP as the party moved to a more socially conservative posture. <paragraph>  In 2004, it looked like the exurbs might be the answer to the GOP’s declining suburban strength. But the housing market crash and recession has put a brake on exurban growth and there are signs in key swing states like Virginia that Democrats can compete — or at least not get killed there.  <paragraph>  Back in 1952, GOP Sen. Robert Taft made the prescient, though not entirely correct, prediction that “The Democratic Party will never win another national election until it solves the problem of the suburbs.”  <paragraph>  The same can’t be said of the GOP and its big city problem — big cities still only constitute 11 percent of the electorate, according to exit polls. But the combination of a fickle suburban vote and a Democratic urban hammerlock is a formula for defeat in many states, as Romney learned Tuesday.
A nation of partisans |   <paragraph>  More signs of deep political polarization, this time from the National Conference of State Legislatures, which reports a notable drop in the number of states with a governor of one party and at least one chamber of the legislature of the opposite party.  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  The Thicket blog: “ The 2012 election saw a significant decline in the number of states with divided government. It's the lowest number of states with divided government since 1952, when there were eight. This rivals our previously reported factoid that we have the lowest number of legislatures with split control (three) since 1944… The number of states with divided government peaked at 31 in 1988 and 1996. It has declined precipitously since 2004. ”  <paragraph>  Those results track with a September   <hyperlink>  Gallup survey that reported a record-high 38% of Americans prefer that the same party control the presidency and Congress, while a record-low 23% said it would be better if the president and Congress were from different parties.  <paragraph>  One way to read the Gallup numbers is to consider them an expression of frustration with divided government in Washington. But when viewed in combination with what's happening in the states, you could also look at it as a sign of growing intolerance among voters for the opposing party.
The GOP's Asian erosion |   <paragraph>  Latinos and African-Americans weren’t the only groups to deliver landslide margins to President Barack Obama on Tuesday.  <paragraph>  According to national exit polls, Obama won 73 percent of the Asian-American vote.  <paragraph>  While Asians only constituted 2 percent of the national electorate, in some states they made up a considerably higher proportion. In California, for example, they represented 11 percent of the vote.  <paragraph>  “With 73 percent of AAPIs [Asian-American and Pacific Islanders] voting for Obama, we are clearly an undeniable and unshakable political power,” said California Democratic Rep. Mike Honda, chairman emeritus of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, in an email. “As the fastest growing ethnic community in the country, we are the margin of victory.”  <paragraph>  Asian voters weren't always so far out of reach for Republicans.  <paragraph>  In 1992, exit polls showed President George H.W. Bush captured the Asian vote 55 percent to 31 percent.  But the end of the Cold War loosened the GOP ties of some Asian subgroups, marking the beginning of a two-decade-long free fall that landed 3 of every 4 Asian voters in the Democratic camp Tuesday.
2010 losers get their revenge | <picture> <paragraph>  Tuesday was a banner day for Democrats seeking a return to the House after losing their seats in the 2010 GOP wave — and for ex-members of Congress in general.  <paragraph>  Nine former House members, consisting of seven Democrats and two Republicans, are returning for the 113th Congress.  <paragraph>  Six are Democrats who lost in 2010 — Bill Foster, Alan Grayson, Ann Kirkpatrick, Dan Maffei, Carol Shea-Porter and Dina Titus.  <paragraph>  In their case, it wasn’t a clear-cut case of voter remorse. Only Maffei and Shea-Porter knocked off the Republicans who defeated them in 2010.  <paragraph>  Foster, Grayson, Kirkpatrick and Titus all ran against different opponents and in seats altered by redistricting. Now they’ll have the awkward prospect of serving in the same delegation as the members who beat them two years ago.  <paragraph>  Grayson celebrated his victory with typical flair: He sent an email to supporters Wednesday calling his win the "biggest comeback in the history of the US House of Representatives," a nod to his blowout 18-percentage-point loss in 2010, and even more lopsided 25-point victory Tuesday.  <paragraph>  Three other ex-members — Republicans Steve Stockman and Matt Salmon and Democrat Rick Nolan — have been out of Congress for more than a decade.  <paragraph>  Those three, who arrived in Congress as part of famed classes of congressional rookies, will return to an institution that will be close to unrecognizable. Nolan was part of the class of Watergate babies in 1974; he’ll take office as a 69-year-old freshman. Stockman and Salmon were part of the GOP class of 1994.  <paragraph>  Not everyone seeking a second tour of duty made it: Ohio Democrat Charlie Wilson, a 2010 loser, fell short in his rematch against GOP Rep.

What color is Pennsylvania? | <paragraph>  With President Barack Obama’s victory Tuesday, Pennsylvania has voted Democratic for president in six consecutive elections. It’s become something of a presidential year mirage for Republicans, always within sight, but never in the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  It’s not that Pennsylvania is unwinnable for the GOP: As Marcel Groen, Democratic chairman of suburban behemoth Montgomery County, reminds the   <hyperlink>  Philadelphia Inquirer, “We still have a Republican governor, a Republican legislature, and a congressional delegation that is overwhelmingly Republican.”  <paragraph>  It’s also true that Obama’s 2008 statewide margin was cut in half and that Mitt Romney was competitive in three of the big four suburban counties that ring Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Still, in the wake of Tuesday’s results, it seems highly unlikely that Pennsylvania will emerge as a key battleground state in 2016 – and even a blowout GOP win in the 2014 midterm election is unlikely to change that. After all, that’s exactly what happened in Pennsylvania in 2010, and it proved to be a harbinger of nothing.
GOP fortunes: From bad to worse in Calif. |   <paragraph>  After a rough election night for Republicans in the nation’s most populous state,  <hyperlink>   the Los Angeles Times sets the scene in California for the next two years:  “ Gov. Jerry Brown and his fellow Democrats are on the cusp of a coveted supermajority in both the Assembly and Senate, giving them the rare power to raise taxes without any Republican support. No single party has held such a supermajority in Sacramento since 1933. To cement the dual two-thirds majorities when the Legislature gets down to business next year, Democrats must hold onto one of two Senate seats to be vacated and a few Assembly seats won in tight races. The Senate seats will be filled in special elections expected in March. The supermajorities would mark a dramatic shift in Sacramento's balance of power, where GOP legislators have aggressively used their ability to block state budget plans and prevent revenue increases to scale back the scope of state government. Coupled with the approval of Brown's tax plan, Proposition 30, the Democrats now have not only the power but also the money to break free of the deficit that has paralyzed state government for years. ”   <paragraph>  Just when it looked like things couldn’t get any worse for Republicans in California, it appears they did. And at the congressional level, there are still three uncalled House races where GOP incumbents are trailing their Democratic challengers with 100 percent of the votes in.  <paragraph>  California Republican Party Chairman Tom Del Beccaro issued this statement Wednesday in response to the election results, which included a big win for labor on a payroll deduction ballot measure.  <paragraph>  “ Yesterday, California moved farther to the Left with a big push from public employee unions. There can be little doubt now that California public employee unions are, by far, the most powerful political force in this state. However, that comes at a heavy price for struggling Californians...  <paragraph>  In a nutshell, "the state is run for the very rich, the very poor and the public employees.' "In my view, Californians will now get to see the plain results of the Democrat-controlled policies both nationally and here at home as the California economy undoubtedly continues to struggle if not get worse under those policies.  <paragraph>  In the meantime, it will be up to Republicans to continue to reach out to more voters and make the case that we need to bring balance to our policies in California. This task has been made more daunting but ever more necessary. ”  <paragraph>  The presidential exit polls paint an especially grim picture that suggests the state won't be competitive in any way for a long time. Obama won every income group, every education group, big and small cities, suburbs and independents.  <paragraph>  While Mitt Romney carried the white vote with 53 percent, Obama won other race and ethnicity groups by an even wider margin than nationally: 96 percent among black voters, 72 percent among Hispanics, 79 percent among Asians.
PPP nailed it |  <paragraph>  The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling, which took flak all year long from Republicans complaining about its partisan bias, had a very, very good Election Day.  <paragraph>  In every swing state, its final presidential polls were validated Tuesday night as PPP reported the correct winner in all 9 battlegrounds and in the 3 other states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania) that the Romney campaign feinted toward.  <paragraph>  In its final state polls before the election, PPP had President Obama ahead in every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reported a statistical tie with Romney at 49.4 and Obama at 49.2. And that’s very close to how it all played out.  <paragraph>  While more than a few firms picked the right winners, PPP also nailed the exact result — at the moment, at least — in Florida, 50-49. And in most cases it was never more than a point or two off each candidate’s performance.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  A Fordham University report released Wednesday ranked the firm first among 28 organizations for the accuracy of its final, national preelection estimates.  <paragraph>  The story in the Senate was much the same for PPP. It correctly picked every winner and, in most cases, slightly understated Democratic support and overstated GOP support.  <paragraph>  The uniformity of its final, pre-election surveys — for Obama, nearly up-and-down the line — left PPP  <hyperlink>  highly exposed in the event of a Romney victory.  <paragraph>  Now, however, the firm can always point to the 2012 scoreboard when confronted with the invariable criticism directed its way.
A GOP wipeout in New England |  <paragraph>  The New England wing of the House GOP, after showing brief signs of life, is extinct again.  <paragraph>  Democrats cleaned out the region on Tuesday, knocking off New Hampshire GOP Reps Charlie Bass and Frank Giunta and fending off stiff challenges to Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney and Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline. Republicans also lost a toss-up open seat race in Connecticut.  <paragraph>  The GOP didn’t fare much better in New England’s Senate races either. Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown lost his seat, Independent Angus King captured retiring Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe’s seat, and Linda McMahon spent more than $40 million in a losing bid for Connecticut’s open Senate seat. In Vermont, meanwhile, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders demolished his GOP foe in a 71-25 landslide while Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse won 65-35.  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink>  Also on POLITICO: Republicans keep control of House)  <paragraph>  New England was without Republican representation in the House for two years after the 2008 defeat of Connecticut Rep. Chris Shays but the election of Bass and Giunta in 2010, along with GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, suggested the GOP still had a pulse.
An Illinois bloodbath |   <paragraph>  After picking up four House seats in 2010, Illinois Republicans gave most of them back Tuesday as Democrats knocked off four GOP incumbents.  <paragraph>  Veteran Rep. Judy Biggert and freshmen Reps. Joe Walsh, Bobby Schilling and Bob Dold fell short in their re-election bids, victims of   <hyperlink>  new congressional lines that made it tougher to hold their seats. Between that and home state President Barack Obama's top-of-the-ticket presence -- he won 57 percent of the statewide vote -- it was too much to overcome.  <paragraph>  The battle for the state's two competitive open seats was a wash, with each party holding the one they controlled.  <paragraph>  National Republicans had long been concerned about their Illinois exposure and the result ends up being something close to a worst case scenario.
25 key counties to watch tonight |   <paragraph>  <picture> AP Photo  <paragraph>  Forget about a national election. Forget about the swing states.  <paragraph>  The presidential election will be won and lost in a relatively narrow band of key counties within the swing states – some competitive, some partisan strongholds. That’s why Jefferson County, Colo., (pop. 540,000) matters more than the most populous county in the nation, Los Angeles County, Calif. (pop. 9.9 million). And why two Wisconsin counties — Dane (pop. 496,000) and Waukesha (pop. 391,000) — are more relevant to the presidential outcome this year than the behemoth to their south, Illinois' Cook County (pop. 5.2 million).  <paragraph>  (  <hyperlink>  Also on POLITICO: Latest polls from across the U.S.)  <paragraph>  Here’s a list of 25 of the most important counties tonight across the swing state map.  Colorado  <paragraph>  Jefferson County Republicans have a registration advantage over Democrats in this Denver suburb, but there are almost as many unaffiliated voters as Republicans. It’s a reflection of a swing county that was once a GOP stronghold but in recent years has drifted leftward. While Jefferson went for George W. Bush in 2004, since then a stream of Democratic statewide candidates have carried the county, including Barack Obama, who won by 9 points there.  <paragraph>  Arapahoe County Another suburban Denver locale, Arapahoe often moves in tandem with Jefferson County — both were once solidly Republican, moved toward the center, voted narrowly for George W. Bush in 2004 and then gave Barack Obama even bigger margins in 2008.  <paragraph>  El Paso County Home to Colorado Springs, with its politically engaged evangelical community and heavy military influence, El Paso County is a conservative stronghold where Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 2-to-1. Romney will need to turn in a big number out of El Paso — now the state’s most populous county — to capture Colorado, and must outperform John McCain, who ran well below the county’s typical landslide GOP presidential margins.  Florida  <paragraph>  Duval County A reliable GOP performer over the years, Jacksonville’s Duval County nearly went for Obama in 2008 — in large part due to high African-American turnout. Republicans need a Romney result in the mid-to-high 50s to help balance out Democratic votes elsewhere in the state.  <paragraph>  Hillsborough County Tampa’s Hillsborough County is one of the nation’s top bellwethers: Since 1960, no presidential candidate has won Florida without carrying it.  <paragraph>  That’s why few places have gotten as much care and attention as Hillsborough this year. Not only have the candidates made several appearances, the GOP held its national convention in Tampa this summer. In 2008, both the McCain and Obama campaigns paid close attention to the county, but Obama won by 53 percent to 46 percent — the exact same margin that Bush won by in 2004.  <paragraph>  Miami-Dade County Obama needs to roll up the score in South Florida but particularly in Democratic Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county. Romney’s performance with Hispanic voters will be important in heavily Cuban-American Miami-Dade, where there are more than a quarter-million Hispanic Republicans.  <paragraph>  Orange County At the other end of the I-4 corridor from Tampa, Romney must improve on McCain’s dismal performance in Orlando’s Orange County, which wasn’t even close in 2008 after being decided by razor-thin margins in 2000 and 2004. But the growth of the non-Cuban Hispanic population in Orange County and neighboring Osceola County — most notably, the Democratic-voting Puerto Rican population — has altered the political equation over the past decade.  <paragraph>  South Florida — namely populous Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties — turned in big margins for Obama in 2008, which makes the I-4 corridor between Tampa and Orlando all the more important.  Iowa  <paragraph>  Dallas County A suburb of Des Moines, Dallas County is Iowa’s fastest-growing county. If Romney’s not winning in a place McCain won in 2008, he’s not going to win Iowa.  <paragraph>  Dubuque County Northeastern Iowa is the most heavily Roman Catholic part of the state. Obama won Democratic Dubuque County 60-39 in 2008, but Republicans expect Romney and running mate Paul Ryan to cut into Obama’s margins among Catholics as a result of tensions surrounding the federal mandate to cover contraceptive services in health plans.  <paragraph>  Johnson County A Democratic stronghold that’s home to Iowa City and the University of Iowa, the Obama campaign needs a big turnout in Johnson County to win roughly two-thirds of the vote.  <paragraph>  Polk County Polk County (Des Moines) is Iowa’s most populous by a wide margin; Democrats have a 39-31 percent registration advantage. Romney doesn’t have to win the county, but keeping Obama to the low 50s is imperative.  Nevada  <paragraph>  Clark County Democratic Clark County (Las Vegas), the state’s population hub, is where two-thirds of the Nevada vote was cast in 2008. There’s a significant Mormon population there, which should boost Romney, but the key for Republicans is holding down Obama’s victory margin.  <paragraph>  Washoe County The second-most populous county in the state and home to Reno, once-reliably Republican Washoe voted narrowly for Bush in 2004. Four years later, however, Obama carried it by 12 points. For Romney to win the state, he must win Washoe and Nevada’s rural counties to overcome Obama’s expected Clark County advantage.  New Hampshire  <paragraph>  Hillsborough County  If Mitt Romney is going to carry New Hampshire, he’s going to need Hillsborough, where more than a quarter of the state vote was cast in 2008. Its biggest cities are familiar datelines in presidential election years — Manchester and Nashua. This was a Bush county in 2000 and 2004 — narrowly — but Obama pulled out a 4-point win here in 2008. North Carolina  <paragraph>  Mecklenberg County Democrats held their national convention in Charlotte for a reason — this county, which has more voters than any other in the state, is critical to victory. In 2008, powered by strong African-American turnout, Obama crushed McCain in Mecklenberg by a stunning 62-37 margin — a full 10 percentage points above John Kerry’s 2004 performance.   <paragraph>  Wake County Though Bush carried it twice, Obama blew out the doors in 2008 in Democratic-trending Wake County: He won 57 percent among the affluent and educated Research Triangle electorate. It’s the state's second-most populous county after Charlotte's Mecklenburg County, so Romney must take a bit out of Obama’s 2008 margin to be competitive. Ohio  <paragraph>  Cuyahoga County If you could know the results of just one Ohio county on election night, Cuyahoga would be your choice. Home to Cleveland, the county is a Democratic stronghold where heavy turnout is essential to Democratic statewide hopes. Four years ago, Obama obliterated McCain there, 69-30, an impressive result even by the county’s standards.  <paragraph>  Franklin County Increasingly Democratic, Columbus’s Franklin County is Ohio’s second-largest population hub after Cuyahoga County. It voted narrowly for Al Gore (49-48), comfortably for Kerry (54-45) and then strongly for Obama (60-39).  <paragraph>  Hamilton County An explosion in African-American turnout in 2008 helped deliver Cincinnati’s Hamilton County to Obama, making him the first Democratic presidential nominee since LBJ to carry the population hub of southwest Ohio.  <paragraph>  Romney needs to win here to offset Democratic margins coming out of Cuyahoga County, a goal that’s within reach since both GOP Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rob Portman, a Cincinnati native and a key Romney surrogate, carried the county in 2010. Virginia  <paragraph>  Henrico County Like many other suburbs of the Eastern Seaboard, Henrico County is a one-time GOP stronghold that evolved over the years into a battleground.  <paragraph>  Over the past 12 years, it voted for George W. Bush twice, for former GOP Sen. George Allen in his unsuccessful 2006 reelection bid and for Republican Bob McDonnell for governor in 2009. But Henrico also voted for Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine for governor and for Barack Obama in 2008.  <paragraph>  African-American turnout here and in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News area is essential for an Obama victory.  <paragraph>  Prince William County Once reliably and strongly Republican, fast-growing, exurban Prince William County in Northern Virginia has become more competitive over the past decade as it’s grown more diverse.  Both 2008 presidential campaigns paid close attention to the county, but on Election Day, Obama won by a surprisingly strong 58-42 score. A Romney victory in Virginia likely begins with a solid showing here; since the Virginia polls close at 7 p.m., it will offer an early indicator of Romney’s suburban and exurban strength. Wisconsin  <paragraph>  Dane County Reliably liberal and the second most populous county after Milwaukee County, Madison’s Dane County is Wisconsin’s partisan counterbalance to GOP stronghold Waukesha County.  <paragraph>  Dane regularly delivers huge Democratic margins, so turnout here is important to the president’s chances of carrying the state for a second time — in 2008, Obama won Dane with 72 percent of the vote.  <paragraph>  Waukesha County If Romney isn’t winning two-thirds of the vote in this GOP bastion, he’s not winning Wisconsin. Like Gov. Scott Walker, who’s twice won more than 70 percent here, Romney needs to roll up big margins here in Wisconsin’s third-largest county, just west of Milwaukee. Without a strong Waukesha performance, it will be almost impossible to offset the Democratic margins coming out of Milwaukee and Dane counties. Michigan  <paragraph>  Oakland County Michigan is a longshot for Romney, to be sure. To have any chance of winning, he’ll need a strong performance in this historically Republican suburb of Detroit. Romney begins with at least one advantage: He grew up there, and his father served as the state’s governor.  <paragraph>  The state’s second-most populous county after Detroit’s Wayne County, Oakland has trended Democratic, but Romney is the kind of GOP nominee who could get traction in the white-collar suburbs here. Some recent polls have Romney winning Oakland and performing well in neighboring Macomb County, both of which are necessary elements of a Romney victory. Pennsylvania   <paragraph>  Bucks County If Obama’s winning here, chances are he’s also running well across the Philadelphia suburbs. With the big four suburban counties — Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery — in his pocket and an expected big Democratic margin out of Philadelphia, there’s almost no chance the president will lose the state.  <paragraph>  But Republicans are convinced they have an opportunity in the historically GOP-oriented Philly suburbs, which is why Romney appeared in Bucks County on Sunday, just two days before Election Day.
N.J. grapples with Sandy confusion |     <paragraph>      <picture>     <paragraph>  The Star Ledger  <hyperlink> reports Saturday that there’s widespread confusion across New Jersey “about polling locations, the logistics of Election Day under a state of emergency, and when the state will give voters more information.”  <paragraph> Conventional wisdom has held that, since New Jersey is a strongly Democratic state and Democratic strongholds in north Jersey took a beating from Hurricane Sandy, President Obama’s popular vote totals stands to be diminished by the prospect of decreased turnout.  <paragraph>   While that may be true, it’s often overlooked that the GOP vote could be significantly affected – the superstorm devastated some of the few Republican strongholds in the state, from Cape May north to Monmouth County. Ocean County, which delivered a 50,000-vote GOP margin in 2008, was especially hard hit.  <paragraph>   In any case, there's little evidence to suggest that the ultimate outcome is going be affected -- the state's 14 electoral votes appear firmly ensconced in the Democratic column.  <paragraph>   (h/t Ginger Gibson)
Obama leads among Asian Americans |  <paragraph>   A new California poll shows why President Barack Obama is again expected to capture the Asian American vote.  <paragraph>   In the state with by far the largest Asian population in the nation, the Field Poll reports Obama holds a 58 percent to 25 percent lead over Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>   In 2008, national exit polls gave Obama a 62 percent to 35 percent advantage over John McCain among Asians, who made up two percent of the electorate.  <paragraph>   According to a  <hyperlink>  Field Poll released Saturday, Obama runs best among California’s Chinese Americans, a group he wins by 63-21. The margin with Vietnamese Americans – a demographic that tends to be more Republican-friendly – is 47-27. Among Korean Americans, Obama leads 41-20 with 39 percent undecided -- the reported percentage of undecided voters among all Asian subgroups is unusually high for this late point in the campaign.  <paragraph>   Among other Asian groups, Obama leads 62-28.  <paragraph>   There’s no data for the Filipino American vote, a constituency where Republicans have had a toehold in the past.  <paragraph>   While the poll notes that the Asian subgroup samples are small, the numbers don’t seem dramatically at odds with a national poll conducted in April by the Democratic firm Lake Research Partners. Back then, nearly six in 10 Asian voters also favored Obama.
Final PPP poll: Warren leads Brown by 6 |   <paragraph>     <picture>    <paragraph>   In Public Policy Polling’s   <hyperlink> final Massachusetts poll, the Democratic firm reports Elizabeth Warren holds a 52 percent to 46 percent advantage over GOP Sen. Scott Brown.  <paragraph>   PPP is in line with 4 other pollsters – including Rasmussen – who have shown Warren with a 5 to 7 point edge since late October.  <paragraph>   If Brown falls short on Tuesday, he’ll rate as one of the most popular incumbents ever to lose a re-election bid. Many of his Senate colleagues would die for his approval ratings: according to PPP, 52 percent approve of his job performance, compared to just 36 percent who disapprove.  <paragraph>   Independents love him: He’s winning 59-38 among independents/others and his approval ratings are 62-25.  <paragraph>   The hurdle Brown faces, of course, is the state’s lopsided Democratic registration advantage – 36 percent of voters are Democrats, compared to just 11 percent Republicans. Fifty-three percent are designated as unenrolled.  <paragraph>   If this latest PPP poll is correct, Warren is winning a higher percentage of Democrats than Martha Coakley, Brown’s Democratic opponent in 2010, and Brown is winning independents by a smaller margin.  <paragraph>   Simply put, given the political make-up of Massachusetts, Brown needs to be winning a greater share of Democratic and independent votes if he hopes to hold his seat on Election Day.
GOP ahead of 2008 early vote pace |  <paragraph>   Until Election Day, there’s no way to know for certain whether or not the GOP’s ground game is better this year than in 2008.  <paragraph>   But by one important yardstick – early voting – the GOP is showing notable improvement in key battleground states.  <paragraph>   According to data compiled by the   <hyperlink> United States Election Project and POLITICO, in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina, Republicans are running several points ahead of their 2008 pace, while Democrats are running several points behind, in percentage of early votes cast.  <paragraph>   Those five are the only swing states that have party registration or offer the statistical breakdowns that enable the comparison.  <paragraph>   In Colorado, Republicans have cast 38 percent of the early vote to 35 percent for Democrats and 27 percent for unaffiliated voters. Four years ago, the numbers were reversed: Democrats cast 38 percent, Republicans 36 percent and independents 26 percent.  <paragraph>   In Iowa, 43 percent of the early vote this year has been cast by Democrats, 32 percent by Republicans and 24 percent by no party or other. In 2008, the numbers were 47 (D) 29 (R) 24 (NP).  <paragraph>   While Nevada doesn’t provide comparative statewide early vote data between 2008 and 2012, a similar pattern emerges in the two counties where the bulk of the state vote will be cast – the Democratic percentage of early votes is down slightly and there’s an uptick in the GOP percentage.  <paragraph>   In both Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno), Democrats continue to outpace Republicans, but by a diminished margin over 2008.  <paragraph>   Back then, Democrats held a 52 percent to 31 percent early vote advantage in Clark County. This year, the margin is 48-33. In Washoe, it was 47-35 in 2008 and it’s 41-40 this year.  <paragraph>   It’s a mistake to draw too many conclusions from the swing state early vote numbers – early voting isn’t over yet and there are too many state-specific variables to make broad conclusions about what it all means.  <paragraph>   But, if nothing else, the early vote suggests that in the states where it matters most, GOP turnout efforts are better organized and operating at a higher level than four years ago. And that matters a great deal in an election that figures to be exceptionally close.
Van Hollen's mixed message |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   It's not uncommon to tailor campaign mailers to specific audiences, but when the messages are this contradictory they tend to stand out — particularly when the Maryland Democratic Party sends them to the same household.  <paragraph>   In this case, the Rep. Chris Van Hollen-as-Paul Ryan's-worst-nightmare piece was sent to the registered Democrat in the house while the more conciliatory 'what divides us' piece was directed to the registered independent.  <paragraph>   It would have been hard to overlook the difference between the red meat mailer and the kinder, gentler piece in any congressional district, but it's especially glaring in Van Hollen's suburban Maryland district, where a high percentage of his constituents work in government or the business of politics.  <paragraph>   In any case, Van Hollen is expected to cruise to an easy victory in his solidly Democratic district.
Jerry Brown's last stand |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   When it comes to   <hyperlink> Proposition 30, the bold tax initiative pushed by California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, the stakes are high — and not just because of the policy implications.  <paragraph>   Dan Walters, a widely respected Sacramento Bee columnist,  <hyperlink> writes that the 74-year-old governor’s legacy hangs in the balance: “   [H]e's now facing the possibility of defeat in what he hoped would be the signal accomplishment of his second governorship — persuading voters to raise taxes and close, albeit temporarily, a chronic state budget deficit.  Fixing California's budget was Brown's major campaign theme in 2010, 28 years after leaving the governorship. He could succeed where other governors — such as predecessor Arnold Schwarzenegger — had failed, he told voters, while promising that he wouldn't raise taxes without their approval. ”  <paragraph>   The polls report that the outcome is very much up in the air, with support just shy of 50 percent, leading Walters to ask, in the event of a loss, “would [Brown] figuratively shrug his shoulders and decide he might find more interesting and positive things to do in the remaining years of his life and forgo another reelection campaign in 2014?”  <paragraph>   There would be no shortage of Democratic talent if Brown declined to run again — Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has already said he will run if Brown doesn’t, and other prospective heavyweights include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Attorney General Kamala Harris.  <paragraph>   A serious primary challenge is also in the realm of possibility. The state’s new top-two primary system — where the top two finishers, regardless of party, move on to the general election — has reordered the state’s political calculus, and it’s not hard to envision scenarios in which it would make sense for an ambitious Democrat to take on a governor whose career in public office began more than four decades ago.
How Pennsylvania will be won |   <paragraph>   Maybe Pennsylvania is a GOP mirage, maybe it’s not.  <paragraph>   But if Mitt Romney is going to win the state, the victory will be powered by his performance in the Philadelphia suburbs, which is why he’ll appear at a suburban Bucks County event Sunday.  <paragraph>   For decades, the big four suburban counties -- Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery – were the engine of GOP statewide victories. But all of them began to drift out of the GOP orbit in the 1990s and they’ve been a big reason why a Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won the state since 1988.  <paragraph>   Without them, it’s nearly impossible for Republicans to counterbalance the big Democratic margins coming out of the city of Philadelphia.  <paragraph>   In 2008, when the suburbs cast 22 percent of the statewide vote, Obama won 57 percent in the four counties. For much of this year, he seemed poised to win them again: A late September Franklin & Marshall College poll had Obama leading 54-36 in the four counties, a lead that he had held for months.  <paragraph>   When Franklin & Marshall polled the state again in late October, however Romney had pulled ahead, 47-45. Whether or not Obama truly cratered in the Philly burbs as the F&M poll suggested, other polls – Susquehanna, internal polling for House candidates – also found that Romney was closing in the collar counties.  <paragraph>   Still, a narrow win in the suburbs of southeastern Pennsylvania probably won’t be enough to put Romney over the top.  <paragraph>   There's every sign he'll perform well in western Pennsylvania outside of Pittsburgh, but he’ll also need to run up the score in the section known as the Republican “T” -- the central part of the state and its northern tier of counties. And Romney will need to be far more competitive than John McCain was in the Lehigh Valley.  <paragraph>   Pennsylvania is an uphill climb for the GOP ticket, but it’s possible. Not without a foothold in the Philadelphia suburbs, though.
The United States of Irrelevance |  <paragraph>   The award for the best campaign story of the day goes to a reporter who isn’t even on the election beat.  <paragraph>   Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for the New York Times, has a must-read about America’s shrinking electoral battleground, and the toxic effects of a system where the vast majority of states are ignored during presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink> Liptak writes: “  In the razor-thin 1960 presidential election, John F. Kennedy campaigned in 49 states. Richard M. Nixon visited all 50. The current contest is just as close and intense, but the candidates have campaigned in only 10 states since the political conventions. There are towns in Ohio that have received more attention than the entire West Coast. The shrinking electoral battleground has altered the nature of American self-governance. There is evidence that the current system is depressing turnout, distorting policy, weakening accountability and effectively disenfranchising the vast majority of Americans. “It’s a new way to run a country,” says Bill Bishop, co-author of “The Big Sort,” a 2008 book that examined the most important cause of the trend: the recent tendency of like-minded people to live near one another. That demographic shift means the country is now dominated by solidly Democratic states on the coasts and solidly Republican ones in the interior and in much of the South. In a close election, all of those states are completely out of reach for one candidate or the other. ”   <paragraph>   The phenomenon Liptak writes about is well-known, but the figures he marshals – and the past landscape he chronicles -- are nevertheless eye-opening.  <paragraph>   In 1960 and 1976, for example, there were 30 contested states including California, Illinois, New York and Texas – in 1976, both California and Texas were decided by three percentage points or less. Today, all have been largely reduced to ATM machine status in presidential elections because the results are a foregone conclusion.  <paragraph>   The scene Liptak leads the story with, Nixon campaigning in all 50 states, is all but unthinkable today.  <paragraph>   One reason, of course, is that many believe Nixon’s pledge to visit every state might have cost him the 1960 election since he refused to forego an Alaska trip in the final days – it was time that would have been better spent in a state offering a bigger electoral vote haul.  <paragraph>   But, as Theodore White wrote in his groundbreaking work, The Making of the President 1960, Nixon’s rigorous and far-reaching schedule was a source of pride. “His press agents had already released the extent of his campaign in a statement: he had flown 65,500 miles, appeared in 188 cities at least once, made over 150 major speeches, and, they estimated, had been seen by 10,000,000 people in the flesh.”
Barone: Romney wins, handily |   <paragraph>   Michael Barone, a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner and co-author of the Almanac of American Politics,  <hyperlink> goes out on a limb and predicts victory for Mitt Romney – by a margin of nearly 100 electoral votes.  <paragraph>  “  Fundamentals usually prevail in American elections. That's bad news for Barack Obama. True, Americans want to think well of their presidents and many think it would be bad if Americans were perceived as rejecting the first black president. But it's also true that most voters oppose Obama's major policies and consider unsatisfactory the very sluggish economic recovery -- Friday's jobs report showed an unemployment uptick. Also, both national and target state polls show that independents, voters who don't identify themselves as Democrats or Republicans, break for Romney. That might not matter if Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 39 to 32 percent, as they did in the 2008 exit poll. But just about every indicator suggests that Republicans are more enthusiastic about voting -- and about their candidate -- than they were in 2008, and Democrats are less so… Bottom line: Romney 315, Obama 223. That sounds high for Romney. But he could drop Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and still win the election. Fundamentals. ”  <paragraph>   In Barone’s estimation, Romney essentially sweeps the swing states, with the exception of Nevada, and even picks up Pennsylvania.  <paragraph>   Michael’s views have drifted rightward over the years and he's become a prominent conservative voice, so there will be a tendency among Democrats to dismiss his prediction. But having worked closely with him in the past — we worked together to produce three Almanacs – I'd argue that no one in the business has a greater command of the American political landscape than Barone.  <paragraph>   Even so, I don’t see his sweep scenario playing out.  <paragraph>   It’s not as implausible as it seems given the tightness of the battleground state map, but it’s contingent on the notion that most pollsters are fundamentally misreading the composition of the electorate -- I'm not there yet. His Ohio and New Hampshire arguments also feel a little unconvincing to me. And my sense is that Pennsylvania and Michigan will move in tandem – probably for Obama, but together in any case.
PPP: Obama leads everywhere |   <paragraph>   The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling has come in for a great deal of criticism this year, mainly from Republicans questioning its motives and methodology.  <paragraph>   The prolific pollster regularly produces quality work, but its Democratic affiliations and occasionally suspect practices [  <hyperlink> here and   <hyperlink> here] have led Republicans to dismiss its findings in the same manner that Democrats dismiss Rasmussen polls as biased toward the GOP.  <paragraph>   Now, almost on cue, PPP has delivered a final series of state polls that puts President Barack Obama in the lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reports a 49-49 tie.  <paragraph>   Against the backdrop of a highly competitive election, the uniformity of those results — and the fact that PPP shows 5- to 6-point spreads in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — puts the firm out on a ledge. So when the final state outcomes are known, PPP figures to be one of the election’s biggest winners or losers, poised either to spike the football — or to explain what went wrong.
Swing state nailbiters |  <paragraph>   President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are within 2 percentage points of each other in 6 swing states, according to Friday’s RealClearPolitics state polling averages.  <paragraph>   In three of those battleground states – Colorado, Florida and Virginia -- the race is within a single percentage point. The spread in Iowa, New Hampshire and Ohio is between 2.0 and 2.4 points.  <paragraph>   The biggest swing state gap is in Wisconsin, where Obama has a 5 point edge.  <paragraph>   Michigan and Pennsylvania, two states where the level of competitiveness is disputed by Democrats, both host tighter races than Wisconsin, according to RCP.  <paragraph>   In Pennsylvania, where Romney will campaign Sunday and his running mate Paul Ryan will stump on Saturday, the difference is 4.6 points. In Michigan, the spread is 3.5 points.
W.Va. GOP: Stop Obama, vote straight ticket |  <paragraph>   In a state where President Obama is deeply unpopular and unlikely even to crack 40 percent on Election Day, the West Virginia Republican Party is urging voters to punish Democrats up and down the ballot, not just the president, by voting a straight Republican ticket. <paragraph>   From a West Virginia GOP email today: “ Saving West Virginia's future begins with marking just one box on your electronic voting machine or paper ballot. A straight Republican ticket ensures you won't vote for anyone who has ever supported Barack Obama. Period. That's the message from the West Virginia Republican Party…   Many elected Democrats claim not to agree with Obama on all issues, but they never stepped in to stop him. Most every Democrat in the State Legislature voted for versions of the ObamaCare bill  or local Cap & Trade. Governor Tomblin and his cronies on the state Board of Public Works have proven to be loyal allies or endorsers of the Obama administration. Senator Manchin and Rep. Rahall take their marching orders directly from the Obama White House. Mitt Romney can't help West Virginia coal unless we help ourselves by electing local leaders like Bill Maloney as Governor and sending John Raese and Rick Snuffer to fortify our team in Washington. ”  <paragraph>   West Virginia is one of a declining number of states — 15 in all — that enables straight ticket voting, which allows voters to select a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single punch or mark on the ballot.  <paragraph>   There’s no real pattern to the list of states that still permit the practice — they’re red and blue, big and small, and spread across the map. The beneficiaries of the practice aren’t entirely obvious either — it depends on the state.  <paragraph>   There’s some irony in the West Virginia GOP’s call for a straight ticket vote — for years, it’s worked to the benefit of local Democrats.  <paragraph>   Still, it’s probably safe to assume that if straight ticket voting is going to have a significant impact this year it’s going to be in states like West Virginia or Utah, where the presidential vote is likely to be lopsided.
Club to GOP: Define 'electable' | <paragraph>   In response to signals that the GOP establishment is prepared to play a more aggressive role in 2014 Senate primaries, Club for Growth President Chris Chocola fires a shot across the bow in    <hyperlink>    an op-ed published Wednesday.    <paragraph>   “ In the wake of some missed opportunities to pick up seats in the U.S. Senate over the last few cycles, one tactical change floated by the GOP establishment is that the party apparatus and its affiliated Super PACs should play a more influential role in primaries to make sure that more “electable” candidates are nominated.  It is hard to imagine a bigger mistake… Everyone wants to avoid the next Todd Akin or Christine O’Donnell, neither of whom received any support from the Club for Growth PAC. But the Republican establishment has a horrendous track record of accurately identifying which candidates are truly unelectable and which are not. Too often, party insiders mistakenly substitute the word “unelectable” for the word “conservative.” ”     <paragraph>   Chocola, a former GOP congressman from Indiana, points to a litany of top, establishment-favored candidates who lost in 2012 and also to a rogue’s gallery of so-called ‘electable’ GOP House and Senate candidates who backfired in spectacular fashion in recent years: Dede Scozzafava, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist.     <paragraph>   The venue for the op-ed is notable – the Kansas City Star, a Missouri-based paper with a big circulation in the backyards of Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, the incoming National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, and Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt.     <paragraph>   Blunt, a member of Senate leadership, and Moran both     <hyperlink>    expressed support – however gingerly -- for the notion of greater national involvement in interviews with POLITICO’s Manu Raju last week.     <paragraph>   Chocola’s message is a reminder that even the sweeping 2012 Senate losses haven’t resolved the intra-party conflicts that cost the GOP a handful of seats in the last two election cycles.     <paragraph>   With the possibility of several primary challenges to GOP incumbents in 2014, as well as a handful of other attractive Democratic-held seats that could generate contentious GOP primaries, the balance struck between the national party and groups like CFG will likely determine whether or not the GOP has a shot at winning back the majority.
Allen West's cautionary tale |  <paragraph>   If you’re wondering how a member of Congress could raise more than $17 million for his reelection bid and still lose, read Alex Isenstadt’s     <hyperlink>    excellent post-mortem on GOP Rep. Allen West’s defeat.    <paragraph>   Alex reports that West had sky-high name ID, a Republican-leaning district, an inexperienced 29-year-old Democratic foe and an election eve lead in his internal polling but still fell short in the end.    <paragraph>   It’s a cautionary tale, not for the average House member but for political provocateurs like West. In his case, he learned the hard way that the iron laws of politics apply even to congressmen with a national base of support.    <paragraph>   His outspoken and over-the-top style, it seems, was out of sync with the locals in his highly competitive district — and he didn’t dial it down in the face of a tough reelection race. Top of the ticket performance was also a problem since President Obama goosed Democratic turnout in his south Florida seat.    <paragraph>   West’s Republican colleagues in Tallahassee didn’t exactly have his back, either. As a relative newcomer to politics, and with his eye fixed on Washington, West lacked relationships in the GOP-controlled state capital that might have resulted in a safer district from redistricting.    <paragraph>   It’s unlikely that we’ve heard the last of West, however. As Alex notes, cable news will still find him an attractive guest. And with his national following and proven fundraising talent — he raised at least $23 million in his two congressional races, a stunning amount for a House candidate — he would be a competitive candidate for any office he sought.    <paragraph>   There’s even a comeback model for lightning-rod pols like West.    <paragraph>   Just a few hours up the road, Democrat Alan Grayson returned to Congress this year after suffering a fate similar to West in 2010. Like West, Grayson’s brand of combative and outspoken liberalism was a mismatch for his more temperate Orlando district.    <paragraph>   But with his prolific fundraising and base of support he was able to jump on his first opportunity to return to Congress, when a new, heavily Democratic seat opened after redistricting. No one bothered to challenge him in the Democratic primary and Grayson won in a November cakewalk.
Richard Mourdock, party buzzkill |         <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   In what’s shaping up to a good Republican year in Indiana — Mitt Romney is likely to carry the state, Mike Pence is likely to win the governorship and both legislative chambers figure to remain in GOP control — GOP Senate nominee Richard Mourdock’s candidacy has turned out to be a discordant note.  <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    The Evansville Courier & Press reports on a marked difference in the reactions to the top of the ticket nominees at the Indiana GOP fall dinner Monday.  <paragraph>   “ However, at the Indiana Republican Party's fall dinner at the Ritz Charles in Carmel on Monday night, enthusiasm for Mourdock's candidacy was measured compared to the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Mike Pence. Some of the hundreds in attendance — mostly women — remained sitting during an ovation for Mourdock and then stood eagerly for Pence. Several Republicans who attended said the reaction was the same at a reception before the dinner.    <paragraph>   Mike McDaniel, the former Indiana Republican Party chairman, said he believes the candidacies of Pence and Mitt Romney will buoy Mourdock — but that the comments on rape and abortion did some damage.    <paragraph>   "Those are comments that he knows he wishes he had back, and yeah, they made it closer," McDaniel said. "I think all the momentum was going in his direction, and that put a screech on that." ”    <paragraph>   Fortunately for Mourdock, top Indiana Republicans haven’t abandoned his candidacy — in part because of what they see as the over-the-top ferocity of the ensuing Democratic attacks against him.    <paragraph>   If he manages to pull out a victory, he’ll still have some serious fence-mending to do if he hopes to be effective in the Senate. Even if Mourdock had never made his comments about pregnancies caused by rape, it would have taken some time for him to win over Republicans who still nurse grievances left from his primary victory over veteran Sen. Dick Lugar. On top of that, he would arrive in Washington far more politically radioactive than the typical freshman senator.
Hurricane Sandy: The political fallout |       <paragraph>     <picture>  <paragraph>   The widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy is going to have an effect on Election Day. The only question is how far-reaching it’s going to be. While some states escaped with far less damage than they feared, as many as 8.5 million residents across the Northeast were without power Tuesday — and a portion of them faced the prospect of an extended period of time without electricity.    <paragraph>   Here are six things to watch in assessing the storm’s political fallout:    <paragraph>   The popular vote The storm’s path along the Eastern Seaboard ripped across a wide swath of blue state America. The list of hardest hit states includes many of the states expected to deliver the biggest victory margins for the president this year — among them New York, which delivered a 2 million vote winning margin to President Obama in 2008.    <paragraph>   While the extent to which elections will be disrupted next week is unclear, the extensive power outages, flooding and wreckage from North Carolina to Maine are certain to have an impact on campaign ground games and could work to depress voter turnout in some places.    <paragraph>   That shouldn’t affect the electoral vote — New York, for example, will still deliver its 29 electoral votes to Barack Obama regardless of the damage to lower Manhattan — but in an exceptionally tight election, lower turnout in the most Democratic states increases the odds of a scenario where Obama wins the Electoral College but loses the popular vote.    <paragraph>   The Senate map The storm’s path cut through a handful of states with some of this year’s closest Senate races — among them Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia.    <paragraph>   While the Connecticut and Virginia races are open seat contests, Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown and Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey are running for reelection. As their home states begin the process of recovery, both incumbents have unique opportunities for free media and to connect with constituents — in an official capacity — at a time when many will be in need of local and federal assistance.    <paragraph>   The House map New York, which has suffered the highest death toll and where 2.3 million households were without power Tuesday, is one the prime House battlegrounds this year. There are as many as eight competitive races, most of them located south of Albany, where the bulk of the power outages have occurred.    <paragraph>   In New Hampshire, where the state’s two Republican incumbents are in danger of losing their seats, the state remains under a flood watch. But the Union Leader reported that “state utility regulators expect power companies to have all electricity restored by the end of the week, well before Tuesday’s general election.”    <paragraph>   The 2016ers Any number of the nation’s governors (or mayors) can attest to the leadership challenges of natural disasters and the powerful effect they can have on approval ratings — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is among those who experienced a post-hurricane spike in popularity after Hurricane Irene.    <paragraph>   The path of Hurricane Sandy means it will test a handful of governors with prospects beyond their home states — Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.    <paragraph>   With the nation watching, how they respond will go a long way toward establishing their home state narrative. But it will also provide a first impression to many voters outside their states whose introduction to them comes solely through glimpses of interviews and press conferences on cable and broadcast news.    <paragraph>   Maine’s electoral vote Maine is one of two states (the other is Nebraska) that allocates its electoral votes by congressional district. While the statewide vote is firmly in the Obama camp, local Republicans believe one of its two congressional districts is within Mitt Romney’s reach — raising the possibility that the GOP nominee could capture one of the state’s four electoral votes.     <paragraph>   It’s a longshot, for sure. But it’s worth noting that the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future recently reserved a significant amount of airtime in Maine television markets. While much of that was in the Portland market — and thus designed to bleed into New Hampshire — the buy also covered the northern-based 2nd District, which is where the GOP sees its opportunity.     <paragraph>   As a whole, the state was largely spared the worst of the storm’s damage. But the aftereffects of the storm were not evenly distributed — at least 60,000 customers were without power Tuesday afternoon, the bulk of them in the Portland area, not in the expansive 2nd District. It could very well mean nothing. But anything that could alter the equation in Maine in the final week of the campaign is worth keeping an eye on.     <paragraph>   A leadership test for incumbents If we’ve learned anything about the politics of natural disasters, it’s that careers can be made and unmade in the preparations and aftermath.    <paragraph>   Snowstorms, hurricanes, flooding, wildfires — they offer rare, unfiltered opportunities for elected officials to prove their mettle under pressure, and at a time of great need.    <paragraph>   The experiences of the Bush family alone sketch out the range of political consequences.    <paragraph>   In August 1992, FEMA’s disjointed response to the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew took its toll on President George H.W. Bush’s standing in Florida, which he managed to carry narrowly that fall but by a dramatically reduced margin over 1988. After three consecutive blowout GOP presidential wins there, Bush scraped to victory by just 2 percentage points, 41 percent to 39 percent — a 20-point GOP drop since 1988.    <paragraph>   His son Jeb Bush, the former two-term Florida governor, learned from the experience. His own hurricane preparation and relief efforts — 8 major storms hit the state in 2004 and 2005 — helped burnish his own reputation as a chief executive and bolster his popularity.    <paragraph>   Jeb Bush’s brother, President George W. Bush, failed to hit the same high mark as president. While his own Florida hurricane response efforts in 2004 were well received, his presidency never recovered from the administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
Register endorsement arrives late |  <paragraph>   As one of the great papers in presidential politics — and one of     <hyperlink>    four major Iowa newspapers to endorse Mitt Romney on Sunday — it's understandable that the Des Moines Register's endorsement would cause a     <hyperlink>    stir this weekend.   <paragraph>   But the impact of the paper’s decision, in terms of persuading voters, is likely limited. <paragraph>   It's not that the Register's endorsement doesn't matter. Rather, roughly a quarter of the state’s vote has already been cast.    <paragraph>   According to figures     <hyperlink>    released Friday by the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, 423,586 absentee votes have already been received. That represents 27 percent of the total votes cast in 2008.   <paragraph>   The late-in-the-campaign endorsements in Iowa and elsewhere suggest that many newspapers haven’t yet accounted for the dramatic growth in the percentage of early voting across the nation. In some states, for example, more than one-third of the vote has already been cast.  <paragraph>   The United States Election Project     <hyperlink>    estimates that, through Sunday, 13.8 million ballots have been cast in all reporting jurisdiction — roughly 10 percent of the total votes cast in the 2008 presidential election.
Obama hopes fade in Nebraska |     <paragraph>   A new Omaha World-Herald poll suggests that President Barack Obama’s chances of a repeat win in Nebraska are fading.    <paragraph>       <hyperlink>    According to the survey, conducted Oct. 23-25, Mitt Romney leads Obama 49 percent to 44 percent in the Omaha-based 2nd District, and a comfortable 52 percent to 38 percent margin statewide. The last time the poll was in the field, in late September, the race was deadlocked at 44 percent in the 2nd District. <paragraph>   The Omaha-based district has been     <hyperlink>    closely watched this year after it produced one of the biggest surprises of 2008 by voting narrowly for Obama. Back then, the Obama campaign captured one of the conservative state’s five electoral votes by taking advantage of Nebraska’s unusual electoral vote allocation — it’s one of just two states (the other is Maine) that awards its electoral votes by congressional district, rather than to the overall state winner.    <paragraph>   In his post-election book, campaign manager David Plouffe labeled the Nebraska district “my personal favorite target.”
Calif. props price tag: $351 million | <paragraph>   <picture>    <paragraph>   While there’s no action at the presidential level in California, where President Barack Obama is poised to win by a comfortable margin, the nation’s largest state is still weathering an avalanche of campaign spending.    <paragraph>   The main driver? The 11 statewide ballot propositions.    <paragraph>   A new     <hyperlink>    MapLight analysis of campaign finance data through Oct. 25 reports that $351 million has been raised by the campaigns for and against the ballot measures.    <paragraph>   The bulk of that staggering total is in just three propositions: two measures that raise taxes (Propositions 30 and 38) and Proposition 32, which would ban unions and corporations from using automatic paycheck deductions to raise money for political purposes.    <paragraph>   At least $128 million has been raised for Prop 32, powered by $68.8 million in pro-labor money.    <paragraph>   The MapLight research reveals some fascinating nuggets, including the extent to which just a few mega-donors and special interests are     <hyperlink>    bankrolling the measures. But what’s equally interesting about the totals is that they serve as a reminder of the exorbitant costs of campaigning in California.    <paragraph>   The state hasn’t been competitive at the presidential level for a quarter-century but if it was, given the price tag of competing there, it would have a dramatic effect on the business of running for president, forcing a wholesale rethinking of strategy, tactics and fundraising practices.
Fla. insiders: Romney will win state  |    <paragraph>   Florida’s top politicos believe by an overwhelming margin that Mitt Romney will carry the state on Election Day.    <paragraph>   According to the latest     <hyperlink>    Tampa Bay Times survey of 120 of Florida’s top political insiders, 73 percent expect Romney will win Florida, compared to just 27 percent who think President Barack Obama will win the state a second time.    <paragraph>   The list of 120 insiders – consultants, lobbyists, fundraisers, political scientists, etc. -- is a little top heavy with Republicans: it’s made up of 65 Republicans, 48 Democrats and 7 independents or minor party types.    <paragraph>   But even among Democrats, 60 percent think Romney will carry Florida. Republicans are more certain: 95 percent believe Romney will win the state’s 29 electoral votes.    <paragraph>   While much of the October polling validates the notion that Romney has the edge in the nation’s largest swing state, all signs point to a very tight finish. At the moment, the RealClearPolitics polling average spread between the candidates is 1.8 percentage points.
NRCC still spending in Rhode Island. Really. |     <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Here’s a headline you don’t expect to see in heavily Democratic Rhode Island, 11 days out from Election Day: “National GOP to spend $280K on final TV push to oust Cicilline.”   <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    Ted Nesi’s report for WPRI: “Republicans have said for weeks they don’t believe the hype that Democratic Congressman David Cicilline is pulling away from GOP challenger Brendan Doherty. Now they’re putting their money where their mouths are. <paragraph>   The National Republican Congressional Committee confirmed Friday it will spend $280,000 on a final round of television commercials to air during the closing week of Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District race, enough to buy 1,000 gross rating points. The ads will air Oct. 30 to Nov. 6.”    <paragraph>   Given the state and the district’s Democratic orientation, the national GOP has typically checked out of Little Rhody by this time of year — if they paid attention at all. But the NRCC’s financial commitment at this late stage is a sign that Cicilline is an incumbent who remains in the danger zone.    <paragraph>   Cicilline, a freshman whose first term has been dogged by controversy surrounding statements he made about the fiscal health of Providence before he left the mayor’s office for Washington, is one of two New England Democrats facing uphill reelection challenges this year — the other is Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney.    <paragraph>   Suffice it to say, if Democrats aren’t able to hold House seats in Rhode Island and Massachusetts in a presidential election year, then there isn’t much hope of capturing a majority.    <paragraph>   UPDATE: Not to be outdone, the DCCC is     <hyperlink>    countering with a $315,000 ad buy for Cicilline, "placed just hours after the National Republican Congressional Committee revealed it will spend $280,000 on a final round of commercials to help Doherty."
Reid: A one-man Romney wrecking crew |  <paragraph>   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid returned to his highly stylized Mitt Romney-bashing Monday in Nevada.  <paragraph>   While Reid’s attacks on Romney have been an ongoing pursuit, the stinging, personal nature of the criticism continues to stand out. Much of it is specific to Romney’s character — among other things, Reid has questioned the GOP nominee’s faith and insinuated he’s a tax cheat. It’s a level of disparagement that reaches beyond standard partisan character attacks, marked by especially blunt rhetoric for a Senate majority leader.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    the Las Vegas Sun report: “ Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called himself a “one-man wrecking crew” on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s refusal to release his tax returns and warned of “17 angry old white men” spending vast sums on political advertising as he tried to rouse Carson City to vote for Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley and President Barack Obama.    <paragraph>   Reid told a packed room in Carson City on Monday that Romney was a “plastic man running for president who changes his position every chance he gets. He isn’t someone who should represent this country.” ”    <paragraph>   Reid and Romney’s shared Mormon faith makes the Nevada senator's scorched-earth approach all the more fascinating. At a time that’s being called "the Mormon moment" because of the historic nature of Romney’s candidacy — he’s the first Mormon major party nominee — and at a time when the former Massachusetts governor has overwhelming support among fellow members of the LDS Church, the nation’s other top Mormon in public life ranks as one of Romney’s harshest detractors.    <paragraph>   One byproduct of the strained relationship is that it expresses the spectrum of LDS political thinking to a nation that’s unfamiliar with it. But it also raises questions about     <hyperlink>    what kind of relationship the two could ever hope to have if Romney were to be elected president.
Linda McMahon's presidential play |  <paragraph>   <video>    <paragraph>   Back in 2010, President Obama dismissed Republican Linda McMahon’s wealth and her background as a pro wrestling executive. The choice between McMahon and Democrat Richard Blumenthal in the open Connecticut Senate race that year, he said, was a “no-brainer.”    <paragraph>   Nevertheless, McMahon, who is running again for Senate this year, is up with a spot urging voters to split their tickets and cast votes for her and the president.    <paragraph>   It’s a matter of political necessity. While Obama isn’t likely to win Connecticut by the same margin as in 2008, when he won 61 percent to John McCain’s 38 percent, he still leads Mitt Romney there by double digits in the polls. That’s a considerable top-of-the-ticket drag for a candidate like McMahon who’s locked in a tight race with Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy.    <paragraph>   And for blue state Obama voters who simply can’t envision themselves casting a GOP vote, McMahon’s ad (titled “Independent”) notes they can support on her on the Independent line — the other ballot line she qualified for.    <paragraph>   The second ballot line could end up making the difference in a razor-thin race. In 2010, the votes Gov. Dannel Malloy won on the Working Families party line put him over the top against Republican Tom Foley.
Dems hold smaller Nevada edge than '08 |    <paragraph>       <picture>    <paragraph>   Democrats will go into Election Day with a 90,000 voter registration advantage in Nevada, a smaller edge than in 2008 when Barack Obama carried the state.    <paragraph>   At the     <hyperlink>    close of voter registration this week in the Mountain West swing state, there were 526,986 Democrats and 436,799 Republicans — a difference of 90,187 active voters.    <paragraph>   In 2008, at the close of registration, Democrats held a statewide advantage of 100,723 voters.    <paragraph>   While the statewide gap between the parties has closed slightly since 2008 — a year when Democratic registration surged in Nevada and Obama carried the state by 121,000 votes — the real growth was among independents. The number of nonpartisan registrations across the state grew by 36,000 since 2008.    <paragraph>   That spike in independents is a prominent feature of the 2012 swing state map.    <paragraph>   According to     <hyperlink>    an August report from the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina posted double-digit percentage gains in the number of independent voters since the last presidential election.
Gay marriage polling uncertain | <paragraph>   A new poll in Washington state shows a comfortable lead for R-74, a referendum that would approve same-sex marriage.    <paragraph>   Fifty-four percent of voters support the ballot measure, according to a     <hyperlink>    KCTS 9 Washington Poll released Thursday, compared with 38 percent who oppose it.    <paragraph>   Washington is one of four Democratic-oriented states that will be voting on same-sex marriage measures on Election Day — Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota are the others — and in each of them, polling suggests that November could provide a breakthrough victory on an issue that has never passed on a statewide ballot.    <paragraph>   In Maryland, for example,    <hyperlink>    a Washington Post poll released Thursday reported voters favor upholding the state’s gay marriage law, 52 percent to 43 percent.    <paragraph>   There’s just one problem. In the past, polling surrounding same-sex marriage measures has been highly unreliable — voters have not always been truthful with pollsters about their true voting preference.    <paragraph>   As a result, the University of Washington, which conducted the KCTS 9 poll, also offered adjusted data to account for “social desirability bias” — the tendency of voters to misrepresent their true feelings on sensitive issues in an attempt to present themselves in a way that will seem favorable to others.    <paragraph>   With the adjusted vote estimate, the results were a lot closer — 53 percent in support of the measure and 47 percent in opposition.    <paragraph>   That’s a 9-point swing in opposition, a dramatically higher percentage than in the unadjusted results and one that should worry marriage equality advocates since the polling spread in Maine, Maryland and Minnesota is under 10 points.
Rendell: Casey hasn't run a campaign |   <paragraph>   <picture>   <paragraph>   As Democrats nervously eye the narrowing polls in Pennsylvania’s Senate race, reliably off-message former Gov. Ed Rendell offers a frank assessment of why Republican Tom Smith has closed the gap with Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr.    <paragraph>   From the     <hyperlink>    Times-Tribune in Scranton: “ “Casey? He hasn’t run a campaign. He’s run one ad, a stupid tea party ad,” Mr. Rendell said. “The tea party ad isn’t bad, but that’s all they’ve run. They’ve run a non-campaign up until now, and Smith has put a lot of money into the campaign. … You start spending money, that’ll change.” ”    <paragraph>   The race, which hasn’t been viewed as a top-tier contest, has undoubtedly gotten closer in the homestretch as Smith has poured millions into TV spots hammering the first-term incumbent. While Casey has led in every public poll taken this year — and at least two recent polls give him a double-digit edge — a handful of other surveys over the past two weeks put his advantage at 4 points or less.    <paragraph>   The Casey camp surely won’t appreciate Rendell’s analysis — delivered to the senator’s hometown paper — but it’s not surprising, given the long history the two pols share.    <paragraph>   Casey’s father defeated Rendell in the 1986 Democratic primary for governor; in 2002, Rendell returned to defeat the junior Casey in a bitter Democratic gubernatorial primary.    <paragraph>   By 2006, the two Democrats had established a working relationship: Rendell backed Casey in the 2006 Senate race. But two years later, they were on opposite sides again as Casey backed Barack Obama in the presidential primary and Rendell emerged as one of Hillary Clinton’s strongest supporters. <paragraph>   UPDATE: It's worth noting that, despite the criticism, Rendell still thinks Casey will win — and run ahead of the president. "If Obama ends up winning the state by 6 or 7 (points)," it's almost impossible for Smith to win. Without question," Rendell said in the same interview. "I think, in the end, Casey is going to run ahead of Obama. If Obama wins by 5, Casey wins by 7 or 8."
The final days of Laura Richardson |     <paragraph>       <picture>  <paragraph>   The House election homestretch always seems to feature one member of Congress who essentially gives up before Election Day, and this cycle that member appears to be California Democratic Rep. Laura Richardson.    <paragraph>   From     <hyperlink>    POLITICO’s Jessica Meyers: “ Richardson raised $7,000 from July through September — a figure smaller than the $9,000 she loaned her own campaign and the roughly $8,000 she was credited for in refunds and canceled checks to her lawyers.    <paragraph>   If the Democratic Transportation and Infrastructure Committee member beats fellow Democratic incumbent Janice Hahn in November, Richardson will have lifted more political baggage across the finish line than any other candidate this election cycle.   <paragraph>   Her campaign did not respond to requests for comment.”    <paragraph>   By raising just $7,000 in the latest quarter — a paltry sum for a member of Congress, let alone one who is engaged in a tough  incumbent vs. incumbent matchup — Richardson appears to have concluded some time ago that there’s no viable path to reelection.    <paragraph>   The congresswoman finished 20 percentage points behind Hahn in California's June "top-two" primary, a disheartening sign since they were the only two candidates running. The result offered little hope that Richardson could close the gap by November.    <paragraph>   Redistricting-related changes to her seat and the congresswoman’s ethics issues were hard enough to overcome, but without any cash — Richardson had just $68,000 cash on hand at the end of September — it’s nearly impossible.
