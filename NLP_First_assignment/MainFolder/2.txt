The ever more solid South |   <paragraph>  Election Day was a downer for Republicans in most states, but not Alabama. Mitt Romney won by more than 20 points there and the GOP picked off the last remaining statewide Democrat. <paragraph>  What little Democratic strength remains in Alabama is concentrated at the county courthouse level.  <paragraph>  From the   <hyperlink>  Associated Press report: “ After losing their last statewide elected office in the Nov. 6 election, Alabama Democrats still can console themselves with one statistic: At least they still hold a majority of the elected offices in county courthouses statewide. … There were contested races for 213 county offices, with 149 having been held by Democrats and 64 by Republicans. Republicans won 67 of the seats that had been held by Democrats, and Democrats won 22 of the seats held by Republicans, according to the state Republican Party. Democrats were successful in urban counties with significant African-American populations. In Montgomery County, the son of Joe Reed, the chairman of the Democratic Party's black wing, defeated a longtime Republican probate judge. Democrats swept all county races in Jefferson County and reelected a Democratic probate judge in Tuscaloosa County against tough GOP opposition. The GOP made inroads into some rural counties as well as counties in northwest Alabama that had always been Democratic strongholds. ”   <paragraph>  The South, as a whole, was largely resistant to the Democratic winds last week. The GOP now controls every legislature in the South, and every governorship except Arkansas. Republicans also managed to hold every one of its House and Senate seats in the region on Election Day – and even managed to pick up a few House seats.
A GOP call for reform in Minnesota | <paragraph>  A critical part of the GOP’s path forward is a reexamining of process — in other words, looking closely at the institutional factors that are generating unelectable nominees.  <paragraph>  In Minnesota, where first-term Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar won a landslide victory over largely unknown Republican state Rep. Kurt Bills, former state GOP Executive Director Ben Golnik   <hyperlink>  calls for an end to the complicated candidate-endorsement process that helped deliver the nomination to Bills.  <paragraph>  “ For Republicans, the endorsing convention is composed of about 2,000 delegates from around the state. To win endorsement, a candidate must receive 60 percent of the vote. Essentially, 1,200 delegates pick the Republican candidate for statewide office. How were these 1,200 delegates selected? First, Republicans had to attend precinct caucuses on a Tuesday night in the dead of winter. These caucus meetings could last for a couple hours as attendees elect delegates to local conventions. The local conventions are held a few weeks after the precinct caucuses, typically on Saturdays, and last several hours. At these conventions, delegates to the state convention are elected. Finally, a state convention  with a $75 registration fee per delegate in 2012  is held on a Saturday in the late spring. Many delegates must travel hundreds of miles and pay for a couple of nights in a hotel. The actual endorsement process can last the entire day and late into the night until a candidate reaches the 60 percent threshold. This costly, time-consuming process discourages involvement from a broader group of Republicans. For families with young children, it requires money for babysitters. For small-business owners, it requires significant time away from their jobs. With the complicated process, a well-organized minority can defeat a poorly organized majority. At the Republican caucuses in February 2012, Ron Paul received about one-quarter of the votes cast. At the Republican state convention a few months later, Paul supporters represented more than half of the delegates. Bills, a teacher and first-term state representative, was selected by the ardent Paul supporters as the U.S. Senate candidate. As Republicans look to run serious challengers to Dayton and U.S. Sen. Al Franken in 2014, strong candidates must be recruited — from both inside the existing structure and from outside. Prospective candidates should skip the endorsement process and run in a primary, rather than focusing solely on the endorsement process. Credible candidates must be able to demonstrate an ability to raise money and communicate a message to a broader audience than 2,000 Republican delegates. ”  <paragraph>  Calls to reform the nominating process in states like Minnesota aren’t new, but it’s possible they’ll take on an increased urgency in the wake of two successive national election cycles marked by unusually weak Republican general election candidates.  <paragraph>  The problem, of course, is that pure primary elections aren’t a cure-all. Primaries have produced the most notorious GOP nominees of the past two cycles — the ones who essentially handed over seats to Democratic candidates.
Rasmussen explains |   <paragraph>  Rasmussen Reports, the prolific automated pollster whose projections fell far from the mark Tuesday,  <hyperlink>  explains what went wrong: “ Our final daily presidential tracking poll showed Romney at 49% and Obama at 48%. Instead, the president got 50% of the vote and Romney 48%. We were disappointed that our final results were not as close to the final result as they had been in preceding elections. There was a similar pattern in the state polls. For example, in Ohio we projected a tie at 49% but the president reached 50% of the vote and the challenger got just 48%. Although every individual result in the battleground states was within the margin of error, the numbers we projected were consistently a bit more favorable for Romney than the actual results. A preliminary review indicates that one reason for this is that we underestimated the minority share of the electorate. In 2008, 26% of voters were non-white. We expected that to remain relatively constant. However, in 2012, 28% of voters were non-white. That was exactly the share projected by the Obama campaign. It is not clear at the moment whether minority turnout increased nationally, white turnout decreased, or if it was a combination of both. The increase in minority turnout has a significant impact on the final projections since Romney won nearly 60% of white votes while Obama won an even larger share of the minority vote. Another factor may be related to the generation gap. It is interesting to note that the share of seniors who showed up to vote was down slightly from 2008 while the number of young voters was up slightly. Pre-election data suggested that voters older than 65 were more enthusiastic about voting than they had been four years earlier so the decline bears further examination. ”  <paragraph>  As mea culpas go, this one is a little thin. While Rasmussen wasn’t alone in misreading the composition of the 2012 electorate, and it’s true that all the firm’s battleground state polls were within the 4-point margin of error, there are a few clunkers in there. In Wisconsin, for example, Rasmussen was the only public pollster reporting a 49-49 tie — in the final two weeks, the five other pollsters in the field there pegged Obama’s lead at 3 and 9 percentage points. The actual result was a 53-46 Obama win.  <paragraph>  Colorado was similarly errant. In the final round of polls, Rasmussen was the one reporting the biggest Romney lead — 50-47 — but the outcome was 51-46 Obama.  <paragraph>  Rasmussen got a few states right — placing Obama in the lead in Nevada and New Hampshire and Romney ahead in North Carolina — but simply getting the winner correct in 3 of 9 battleground states isn’t going to win over the many detractors who regularly dismiss the firm’s polls for their often overly rosy GOP predictions.
The GOP's big city problem | <picture> <paragraph>  There’s at least one ray of hope for the GOP in Mitt Romney’s loss Tuesday: Exit polls show he won back the suburbs from President Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  Romney won the suburbs 50 percent to 48 percent, recapturing them after Obama won the crabgrass frontier by the same margin in 2008.  <paragraph>  It’s an important symbolic win for the GOP since, with few exceptions, the suburbs have been the province of the Republican Party in post-war presidential elections.  <paragraph>  But Romney’s victory margin in the suburbs wasn’t by nearly enough, and it underscores a problem confronting the GOP. While the suburbs powered the GOP for decades, they also created a false sense of security — and a political dependency — that threatens the party’s future in an era of when most of the older suburbs are firmly in the Democratic column and many of the newer ones are up for grabs.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  Sommer Mathis of the Atlantic Cities website puts it succinctly:  “Republicans can never again concede all of the urban vote to the Democrats…  <paragraph>  The math of assuming cities will go to Democrats and thus not bothering to craft a message aimed at the people who live there is just a losing game going forward for Republicans. And it's only going to get worse as urban populations increase and become more concentrated. ”  <paragraph>  Even if you don’t buy the recent analysis that cities are growing faster than the suburbs, the big city Democratic landslides  71% in 2000, 60% in 2004, 70% in 2008, and now 69% in 2012 in cities of over 500,000  are a serious issue for the GOP in an era when the suburbs are an unreliable constituency. <paragraph>  A case in point is Pennsylvania, where Romney ran more competitively than John McCain in the Big Four suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia — and even won one of them by a razor-close margin — but was still swamped by Philadelphia, which delivered a Democratic margin in the neighborhood of 465,000 votes.  <paragraph>  The GOP practice of ignoring the cities made political sense for decades, when the suburbs and urban America were at odds. The GOP was unquestionably the party of the suburbs — it celebrated the suburban way of life in a way that Democrats did not because of their urban base — and the party presented itself as a bulwark against the crime and dysfunction of the Democratic central cities. But as the cities came under a new generation of leadership in the 1990s and the suburbs began to mature and diversify — not to mention share some of the same problems as the central cities — the GOP’s grip began to loosen.  <paragraph>  There were other important factors in play as well — Democrats began to compete more aggressively for the suburban vote and many suburbs dislodged themselves from the GOP as the party moved to a more socially conservative posture. <paragraph>  In 2004, it looked like the exurbs might be the answer to the GOP’s declining suburban strength. But the housing market crash and recession has put a brake on exurban growth and there are signs in key swing states like Virginia that Democrats can compete — or at least not get killed there.  <paragraph>  Back in 1952, GOP Sen. Robert Taft made the prescient, though not entirely correct, prediction that “The Democratic Party will never win another national election until it solves the problem of the suburbs.”  <paragraph>  The same can’t be said of the GOP and its big city problem — big cities still only constitute 11 percent of the electorate, according to exit polls. But the combination of a fickle suburban vote and a Democratic urban hammerlock is a formula for defeat in many states, as Romney learned Tuesday.
A nation of partisans |   <paragraph>  More signs of deep political polarization, this time from the National Conference of State Legislatures, which reports a notable drop in the number of states with a governor of one party and at least one chamber of the legislature of the opposite party.  <paragraph>  From   <hyperlink>  The Thicket blog: “ The 2012 election saw a significant decline in the number of states with divided government. It's the lowest number of states with divided government since 1952, when there were eight. This rivals our previously reported factoid that we have the lowest number of legislatures with split control  three  since 1944… The number of states with divided government peaked at 31 in 1988 and 1996. It has declined precipitously since 2004. ”  <paragraph>  Those results track with a September   <hyperlink>  Gallup survey that reported a record-high 38% of Americans prefer that the same party control the presidency and Congress, while a record-low 23% said it would be better if the president and Congress were from different parties.  <paragraph>  One way to read the Gallup numbers is to consider them an expression of frustration with divided government in Washington. But when viewed in combination with what's happening in the states, you could also look at it as a sign of growing intolerance among voters for the opposing party.
The GOP's Asian erosion |   <paragraph>  Latinos and African-Americans weren’t the only groups to deliver landslide margins to President Barack Obama on Tuesday.  <paragraph>  According to national exit polls, Obama won 73 percent of the Asian-American vote.  <paragraph>  While Asians only constituted 2 percent of the national electorate, in some states they made up a considerably higher proportion. In California, for example, they represented 11 percent of the vote.  <paragraph>  “With 73 percent of AAPIs [Asian-American and Pacific Islanders] voting for Obama, we are clearly an undeniable and unshakable political power,” said California Democratic Rep. Mike Honda, chairman emeritus of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, in an email. “As the fastest growing ethnic community in the country, we are the margin of victory.”  <paragraph>  Asian voters weren't always so far out of reach for Republicans.  <paragraph>  In 1992, exit polls showed President George H.W. Bush captured the Asian vote 55 percent to 31 percent.  But the end of the Cold War loosened the GOP ties of some Asian subgroups, marking the beginning of a two-decade-long free fall that landed 3 of every 4 Asian voters in the Democratic camp Tuesday.
2010 losers get their revenge | <picture> <paragraph>  Tuesday was a banner day for Democrats seeking a return to the House after losing their seats in the 2010 GOP wave — and for ex-members of Congress in general.  <paragraph>  Nine former House members, consisting of seven Democrats and two Republicans, are returning for the 113th Congress.  <paragraph>  Six are Democrats who lost in 2010 — Bill Foster, Alan Grayson, Ann Kirkpatrick, Dan Maffei, Carol Shea-Porter and Dina Titus.  <paragraph>  In their case, it wasn’t a clear-cut case of voter remorse. Only Maffei and Shea-Porter knocked off the Republicans who defeated them in 2010.  <paragraph>  Foster, Grayson, Kirkpatrick and Titus all ran against different opponents and in seats altered by redistricting. Now they’ll have the awkward prospect of serving in the same delegation as the members who beat them two years ago.  <paragraph>  Grayson celebrated his victory with typical flair: He sent an email to supporters Wednesday calling his win the  biggest comeback in the history of the US House of Representatives,  a nod to his blowout 18-percentage-point loss in 2010, and even more lopsided 25-point victory Tuesday.  <paragraph>  Three other ex-members — Republicans Steve Stockman and Matt Salmon and Democrat Rick Nolan — have been out of Congress for more than a decade.  <paragraph>  Those three, who arrived in Congress as part of famed classes of congressional rookies, will return to an institution that will be close to unrecognizable. Nolan was part of the class of Watergate babies in 1974; he’ll take office as a 69-year-old freshman. Stockman and Salmon were part of the GOP class of 1994.  <paragraph>  Not everyone seeking a second tour of duty made it: Ohio Democrat Charlie Wilson, a 2010 loser, fell short in his rematch against GOP Rep. Bill Johnson.
What color is Pennsylvania? | <paragraph>  With President Barack Obama’s victory Tuesday, Pennsylvania has voted Democratic for president in six consecutive elections. It’s become something of a presidential year mirage for Republicans, always within sight, but never in the party’s grasp.  <paragraph>  It’s not that Pennsylvania is unwinnable for the GOP: As Marcel Groen, Democratic chairman of suburban behemoth Montgomery County, reminds the   <hyperlink>  Philadelphia Inquirer, “We still have a Republican governor, a Republican legislature, and a congressional delegation that is overwhelmingly Republican.”  <paragraph>  It’s also true that Obama’s 2008 statewide margin was cut in half and that Mitt Romney was competitive in three of the big four suburban counties that ring Philadelphia.  <paragraph>  Still, in the wake of Tuesday’s results, it seems highly unlikely that Pennsylvania will emerge as a key battleground state in 2016 – and even a blowout GOP win in the 2014 midterm election is unlikely to change that. After all, that’s exactly what happened in Pennsylvania in 2010, and it proved to be a harbinger of nothing.
GOP fortunes: From bad to worse in Calif. |   <paragraph>  After a rough election night for Republicans in the nation’s most populous state,  <hyperlink>   the Los Angeles Times sets the scene in California for the next two years:  “ Gov. Jerry Brown and his fellow Democrats are on the cusp of a coveted supermajority in both the Assembly and Senate, giving them the rare power to raise taxes without any Republican support. No single party has held such a supermajority in Sacramento since 1933. To cement the dual two-thirds majorities when the Legislature gets down to business next year, Democrats must hold onto one of two Senate seats to be vacated and a few Assembly seats won in tight races. The Senate seats will be filled in special elections expected in March. The supermajorities would mark a dramatic shift in Sacramento's balance of power, where GOP legislators have aggressively used their ability to block state budget plans and prevent revenue increases to scale back the scope of state government. Coupled with the approval of Brown's tax plan, Proposition 30, the Democrats now have not only the power but also the money to break free of the deficit that has paralyzed state government for years. ”   <paragraph>  Just when it looked like things couldn’t get any worse for Republicans in California, it appears they did. And at the congressional level, there are still three uncalled House races where GOP incumbents are trailing their Democratic challengers with 100 percent of the votes in.  <paragraph>  California Republican Party Chairman Tom Del Beccaro issued this statement Wednesday in response to the election results, which included a big win for labor on a payroll deduction ballot measure.  <paragraph>  “ Yesterday, California moved farther to the Left with a big push from public employee unions. There can be little doubt now that California public employee unions are, by far, the most powerful political force in this state. However, that comes at a heavy price for struggling Californians...  <paragraph>  In a nutshell,  the state is run for the very rich, the very poor and the public employees.'  In my view, Californians will now get to see the plain results of the Democrat-controlled policies both nationally and here at home as the California economy undoubtedly continues to struggle if not get worse under those policies.  <paragraph>  In the meantime, it will be up to Republicans to continue to reach out to more voters and make the case that we need to bring balance to our policies in California. This task has been made more daunting but ever more necessary. ”  <paragraph>  The presidential exit polls paint an especially grim picture that suggests the state won't be competitive in any way for a long time. Obama won every income group, every education group, big and small cities, suburbs and independents.  <paragraph>  While Mitt Romney carried the white vote with 53 percent, Obama won other race and ethnicity groups by an even wider margin than nationally: 96 percent among black voters, 72 percent among Hispanics, 79 percent among Asians.
PPP nailed it |  <paragraph>  The Democratic automated polling firm Public Policy Polling, which took flak all year long from Republicans complaining about its partisan bias, had a very, very good Election Day.  <paragraph>  In every swing state, its final presidential polls were validated Tuesday night as PPP reported the correct winner in all 9 battlegrounds and in the 3 other states  Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania  that the Romney campaign feinted toward.  <paragraph>  In its final state polls before the election, PPP had President Obama ahead in every battleground state except North Carolina — where it reported a statistical tie with Romney at 49.4 and Obama at 49.2. And that’s very close to how it all played out.  <paragraph>  While more than a few firms picked the right winners, PPP also nailed the exact result — at the moment, at least — in Florida, 50-49. And in most cases it was never more than a point or two off each candidate’s performance.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink>  A Fordham University report released Wednesday ranked the firm first among 28 organizations for the accuracy of its final, national preelection estimates.  <paragraph>  The story in the Senate was much the same for PPP. It correctly picked every winner and, in most cases, slightly understated Democratic support and overstated GOP support.  <paragraph>  The uniformity of its final, pre-election surveys — for Obama, nearly up-and-down the line — left PPP  <hyperlink>  highly exposed in the event of a Romney victory.  <paragraph>  Now, however, the firm can always point to the 2012 scoreboard when confronted with the invariable criticism directed its way.
Mitt Romney's post-election gaffe |   <paragraph>  Mitt Romney proved again that in Washington, a gaffe is when you accidentally say something that you mean. He also showed why he was ideologically unfit to be the Republican nominee for president.  <paragraph>  For Mr. Romney, the gaffe caught on camera and made public in September was that 47 percent of Americans are victims, grifters and thieves. And in a conference call with supporters on Wednesday, the former Massachusetts governor further exposed just how sheltered his life has been by explaining that these grifters were mostly minorities bought off with  gifts  from Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  The conference call underlined what I have been saying for well over a year: that Mr. Romney has no idea what conservatism offers 100 percent of Americans who believe that freedom leads to prosperity and centralized planning is a road to serfdom. That message led Margaret Thatcher to an unlikely victory in 1979 and Ronald Reagan to a historical landslide a year later. And if Mr. Romney believes that message is no longer relevant to Hispanics and African-Americans, he should've stayed in La Jolla to oversee the building of his car elevator.  <paragraph>  The future belongs to conservatism. It's time Republicans start electing leaders who actually believe it
An enduring sacrifice few can understand |   <paragraph> I remember moving past the generals and politicians to greet grief-stricken family members who lost a loved one at Khobar Towers. The 1996 terrorist attack killed 19 U.S. servicemen stationed in Saudi Arabia and several of those killed in the attack were stationed at Eglin Air Force Base in the heart of my congressional district.  <paragraph>  I quietly shook hands with the parents who lost their sons, the wives who lost their husbands and the sisters who lost their brothers. And as is usually the case when military tragedies curse families, one can do little more in their presence than pray for the fallen and offer assistance for those family members left behind.  <paragraph>  I slowly made my way down the receiving line until I was stopped by the sight of a young boy who was staring ahead vacantly across the room, past the generals and politicians who were walking by to pay their last respects to his dad. My eyes began to well up at his sight and I moved quickly to hug the boy. All I could whisper was that I was so sorry for his loss. I moved away just as quickly to hide my eyes from him and go outside for the ceremony.  <paragraph>  The fact that the boy was the same age as my oldest son in 1996 is why I still remember that jarring encounter on this Memorial Day 16 years later. This morning I recall all I shared with my sons over those 16 years: the Little League games I got to coach, the birthday parties I got to attend, the Christmas Eve candlelight services I enjoyed with my family, the prom pictures I forced Joey and Andrew to endure while their dates smiled and they just stood there squirming in their misfitting tuxes.  <paragraph>  All these years later, I still pray to God every night that I will be around to see them graduate, get married, have children and move safely into middle age -- all the things this young boy would endure without his dad. I also pray that children of the fallen have loved ones to pick up the pieces and move them forward toward a fulfilled life, but I know that is not always the case.  <paragraph>  When we talk about the American heroes who give their all for their country, I wonder how many people realize that their sacrifice continues being paid every day. Then I wonder why Washington refuses to treat those heroes who come home with the respect they deserve.  <paragraph>  On this Memorial Day, let us hope that one day soon they will. May God bless our fallen heroes and their family members today and far into the future.
Time again for Obama to lead from behind |   <paragraph>  Today, Sunday morning newspapers around the world screamed with headlines announcing yet another tragedy out of Syria. Journalists inside the war-torn country report that forces aligned with Bashar al-Assad massacred at least 90 Syrians with indiscriminate mortar attacks on civilian targets; more than 30 children were among the dead.  <paragraph>  The massacre in Houla is another example of how deadly Kofi Annan's Syrian cease-fire has been for civilians who still believe the international community will actually do something to prevent further slaughter. After yesterday's attacks, Syrians have reason to become increasingly bitter at the United States for sitting back over the past year and doing very little while Assad murdered 10,000 of his own citizens.    <paragraph>  Imagine how difficult it must be for the mother of a Syrian child killed by Assad's bloodied hands to grasp the geopolitical complexities that compelled the United States to launch air attacks against Muammar Gadhafi's Libya  in the name of protecting civilians  while the same superpower has sat idly by while its enemy indiscriminately kills his fellow countrymen. The reality is that the Administration's Libya and Syria policies cannot be squared in a way that makes sense to even the most gifted foreign-policy analyst.   <paragraph>  It would be depressing to believe that the greatest sin 10,000 dead Syrians had on their heads before being killed was to have the bad luck of not being born in an oil-rich country like Libya. And yet I am not cynical enough to believe that such crude calculations enter the minds of American presidents.   <paragraph>  But with every unanswered massacre that Assad launches, Americans and members of the international community can be forgiven for possessing a healthy dose of skepticism.  <paragraph>  That's why it is time once again for Barack Obama to lead from behind. His patience toward Libya last year angered neoconservative hawks who would've preferred the president launch attacks first and ask questions later. But he wisely chose instead to give the Arab League and our European allies enough time and space to take the lead against Gadhafi's ruthless regime. It was then left, of course, to American men and women in uniform to help drive the Libyan dictator from power. They did just that, and the president was rightly praised for his shrewd handling of the crisis.   <paragraph>  The growing crisis in Syria calls for a similar approach. Fortunately, the president has already declared that Mr. Assad must go. His administration has also wisely continued to ramp up pressure on Russia.   <paragraph>  But the president must do more, by focusing intense pressure on allies and unbearable pressure on enemies to drive Bashar al-Assad from power. That outcome is not only a moral imperative. It is also in the United States long-term strategic interest.  <paragraph>  That is why it is time for a repeat performance from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
Are we all big government conservatives now? |   <paragraph>  Every year, liberal bloggers and talk show hosts become unhinged when polls are released that suggest conservatives outnumber liberals by a 2-to-1 margin. This past year left-wing bloggers became particularly unhinged when a fact-checking organization declared it  mostly true  that the majority of Americans were conservative. Apparently, Politifact's opinion on the semantic difference between   plurality  and  majority  was of such great import to American liberals that this fake controversy warranted weeks of ideological screeching.  <paragraph>  Hold on to your Cheetos sports fans, because Gallup just <hyperlink> released its annual poll on voters' ideological bent, and once again self-described conservatives outnumbered liberals by a 2-to-1 margin. In fact, 46% of Americans now call themselves  economic conservatives  while only 20% describe themselves as  liberal .  <paragraph>  Predictably, fewer voters labeled themselves  conservative  on social issues.  <paragraph>  So let the screaming match begin between ideological camps. But for those interested in how voters' attitudes will impact the 2012 presidential election, the Gallup poll's trend line suggest that voters are becoming more economically conservative as a reaction to George W. Bush and Barack Obama's big bailouts in 2008 and 2009, and the never-ending debate over health care.  <paragraph>  The obvious irony is that while Americans like to think of themselves as rugged individualists who are perfectly capable of pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, these same cowboys would tar and feather any leader who tried to curb spending on Medicare, Social Security, farm subsidies, defense contracts, student loans or any other part of America's $4 trillion budget.   <paragraph>  So perhaps we are dealing with the self-delusion of citizens who are every bit as addicted to massive government spending as their European cousins. Still, delusional voters are allowed into voting booths on election day. That means Barack Obama had better learn to channel Bill Clinton sooner rather than later-- and praise the glories of small government individualism while running a federal government whose debt is racing toward $20 trillion.
Gay marriage, abortion and the independent voter |   <paragraph>  With apologies to ideologues of all parties, the latest Gallup poll on abortion shows just how pragmatic American voters can be when it comes to social issues.  <paragraph>  That may come as news to extreme special interest groups on both sides of the aisle. After all, these organizations have made a good living through the years by pushing their own brand of morality on American voters. These advocacy groups have also contributed to the toxic environment in Washington by simplifying every issue and demonizing every opponent.  <paragraph>  Few issues have divided Washington and America more than abortion and gay marriage. And yet Americans are now declaring independence from rigid agendas by heading in opposite ideological directions in these two heated debates.  <paragraph>  According to recent surveys, voters are becoming more progressive on gay marriage. The divide-and-conquer strategy that worked for Republicans in 2004 will never again be as effective as it was during George W. Bush's reelection campaign.  <paragraph>  At the same time, voters are becoming more conservative on abortion. The latest Gallup poll shows that 50 percent of Americans identify themselves as pro-life. That's a 17 point jump from when the same question was asked by Gallup in 1996. A record low 41 percent of Americans surveyed now identify themselves as pro-choice. That is a 15 point drop since 1996.  <paragraph>  Despite large swings in the way voters identify themselves on this issue, politicians should also take note that the majority of Americans tell pollsters they still believe abortion should be legal in some cases.  <paragraph>  So what does it mean? Perhaps that attitudes on abortion are changing, but not overnight. The same is true of gay marriage, as Team Obama learned earlier this month. Chicago privately concedes that President Obama is now more likely to lose the swing state of North Carolina because of his recent statement on gay marriage.  <paragraph>  Republicans are just as likely to lose suburban women and other swing voters if they dart too far right on abortion over the next six months. The GOP presidential primary campaign underlined that fact in bright red ink earlier this year.  <paragraph>  Still, attitudes are changing on both issues. And any politician who believes he can blindly follow a tired party line will soon find himself out of touch and out of office.
 270 to win |   <paragraph>  Mark Halperin and I looked over the electoral map this morning during a commercial break and were surprised by how quickly our view of the political landscape has changed over the past few weeks. With the economy flatlining and the president's declaration on gay marriage sparking controversy across the South, much has changed politically since the beginning of May.  <paragraph>  According to both campaigns, the swing states most impacted by gay marriage will be Florida, North Carolina, Iowa and Ohio. Most insiders believe that Florida and North Carolina are swinging Mitt Romney's way and now seem to be uphill climbs for the president. Ohio will be impacted by gay marriage on election day, but to a lesser degree than Southern states. Still, that issue  along with the possible selection of Ohio Senator Rob Portman as Romney's running mate  could tip the Buckeye State state back into the Republican column once again.  <paragraph>  Which leads to Mr. Halperin's and my surprising takeaway this morning.  <paragraph>  If Mitt Romney is able to steal Florida, Ohio and North Carolina from Team Obama, the two key swing states this November will turn out to be the unlikely pair of Virginia and Colorado. Even though the last two cycles have made it seem like Florida and Ohio would be the swing states that mattered most for years to come, it now looks like we will all be focused on  Virginia, Virginia, Virginia  late into the night on November 6th.  <paragraph>  This could, of course, all change if it is a Romney surrogate who goes on a Sunday morning show and veers wildly off message by calling everyone who ever worked for Bain Capital  a bunch of greedy bastards.  But don't expect that to happen. But do expect a campaign that may focus less on Florida and Ohio than states like Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire and Nevada. These states that were second-tier swing states not so long ago now seem poised to help decide who sits in the Oval Office over the next four years.
Chicago books mayor for telling truth |  <paragraph>  Only Nixon could go to China, only Clinton could pass welfare reform and only Cory Booker could draw blood by  <hyperlink>  calling out Barack Obama. <paragraph>  That's because Republicans have called President Obama every name in the book over the past four years --from Marxist to fascist to racist. During that time, the right-wing noise machine spewed out such a steady stream of insults toward Mr. Obama that most swing voters simply don't pay attention to those howlers who keep crying wolf.  <paragraph>  Enter <hyperlink> Cory Booker.  <paragraph>  The formerly fast-rising Democratic star and Obama surrogate went on  Meet the Press  Sunday morning to blast his candidate's populist attacks on venture capitalism. In so doing, the Newark mayor committed a terrible gaffe by Washington standards.  <paragraph>  He told the truth.  <paragraph>  Now he will surely pay a steep political price for his honesty. Never mind the fact that many of the big money contributors who made Barack Obama's historic election possible four years ago continue to practice the same brand of capitalism that made Mitt Romney rich. And many of those contributors are being asked once again to support Barack Obama's campaign.  <paragraph>  Cory Booker may have been forced to  <hyperlink> produce a hostage video last night, but it is Barack Obama who remains handcuffed today to the same big money capitalists that he still blames for ruining America.
These are not the Times to be biased | <paragraph>  Maybe I shouldn't be so tough on those I love. God knows I would have more friends in my own political party if I had kept my mouth shut while George W. Bush was running up trillions in debt and aping Woodrow Wilson on the world stage. But I can't help myself. Maybe I just expect more from those I love.  <paragraph>  Which brings me to the New York Times. I often criticize the Old Gray Lady despite the fact it's the one newspaper I must read daily.  <paragraph>  I expect its editorial page to reflect the liberal community it serves. And I endure its left-leaning story selection because it also brings the best writing and reporting in the world to my doorstep. But it tends to embarrass itself occasionally during heated presidential campaigns.  <paragraph>  The Times' public editor recently scolded his paper's past cheerleading for Barack Obama, and for good reason. The paper published separate profiles of John and Cindy McCain during the peak of the 2008 campaign that smeared the GOP nominee and his wife. When this kind of slanted reporting wins the day, I am as distressed at the Times' failings as I am when Republican politicians stop being conservative and start being radical. <paragraph>  This past week the Newspaper of Record ran a story above the fold on page one reporting that Republicans were preparing a new round of attacks on Barack Obama's relationship with Jeremiah Wright. They followed that Thursday story with a follow up article the next day. And then today, the Times'  Political Memo  stirred the pot again by writing this:  <paragraph>  A report in The New York Times on Thursday exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama’s onetime pastor, and his angry black-power sermons.  <paragraph>  Perhaps this news story might justify a three day roll out if, in fact, that narrative were accurate. Sadly, for the New York Times and Barack Obama's campaign, it is not.  <paragraph>  Despite what the Times claims, the undisputed facts are these: 1. There was no  secret plan  by  strategists  or  financiers  to push the Wright story, 2. The super pac in question asked advertisers to bring them ad ideas focused on the federal debt, 3. The ad man who pitched the idea to the super pac conceded that the group did not want proposals that dealt with anything other than fiscal issues, 4. Mitt Romney and his campaign had nothing to do with anything involving this ad. 5. The Republican Party had nothing to do with anything involving this pitch.   <paragraph>  Anyone who has spent any time working on a political campaign knows that terrible ideas bubble up and are popped by smart managers every five minutes or so. The fact that the New York Times decided to seize on a stupid idea by a guy not connected to  a  the super pac,  b  the RNC or  c  the Romney campaign shows just how much of a stretch it was to put Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg's story on the top of page one.  <paragraph>  Zeleny and Rutenberg are great reporters. And their story calling out a single strategist for pushing this self-destructive idea should find its way into the news stream. But until the New York Times begins publishing the moronic ideas of Democratic ad men making pitches to George Soros or Ted Turner, they should limit their breathless attacks against a political party they clearly oppose.  <paragraph>  This responsibility falls on the shoulders of editors who need to show a bit more partisan restraint on page one during election years. Such restraint will help them avoid the perception that they are shamelessly cheerleading for Democrats while maintaining the loyalty of many readers who do not share the editors' political views.
The widening partisan divide |   <paragraph>  There they go again.  <paragraph>  The White House and Congress are starting to circle each other in another mindless default dawdle while Greece teeters, Italy shakes, Spain splinters and France frets. The Eurozone's southern states are staggering toward insolvency while millions of Europeans cope with Depression-style suffering.  <paragraph>  The Greek political system is suffering a nervous breakdown, with spoiled voters almost certainly assuring an economic meltdown and Greece's exit from the EU.  <paragraph>  Spain's economy is strapped with a 25 percent unemployment rate that tops out at 50 percent for that nation's young workers. The situation has gotten so bad that its prime minister is now fretting that his country may soon be shut out of world markets. Italy's debt now equals a staggering 120 percent of its nation's GDP while the country suffers through three straight quarters of economic decline.  <paragraph>  Now the rest of Europe waits nervously to see how the dominoes falling in Athens will affect Rome, Paris and Berlin.  <paragraph>  Meanwhile, U.S. politicians continue playing the same insipid Washington games that have led our country to a record $16 trillion debt. Over the past 24 hours, GOP House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid exchanged barbs about yet another default showdown, while President Obama called both sides into the White House so he could quickly leak details of his scolding lecture to lawmakers.  <paragraph>  That's sure to seal the deal, Mr. President.  <paragraph>  Taken together, the events of the past 24 hours prove that our national leaders remain locked in trench warfare where neither side dares to cross the ever widening partisan divide.  <paragraph>  Politically, some House members will probably benefit from such reckless, ideological behavior. But the president will not. It will be incumbent upon him to show independent voters just how aggressively he will fight over the next four years to bring deficit spending under control. Leave it to Bill Clinton to understand the moment at hand and figure out how to capitalize politically. Tuesday night, while mere politicians were lobbing spit balls at each other, the former president addressed the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and declared that facing down the budget crisis should be  front and center  in the 2012 campaign.  <paragraph>  Before left wing bloggers attack Mr. Clinton, they should remember that this is the same Democratic president who bloodied his Republican enemies by declaring that  the era of big government is over.   <paragraph>  Of course it wasn't by a long shot but then-President Clinton knew that the best way to win independent voters away from the GOP was by avoiding the label of  big government liberal.  He signed a Republican welfare reform bill, promised to balance the budget and then got easily reelected in 1996.  <paragraph>  Barack Obama needs to perform a similar magic trick 16 years later.  <paragraph>  Despite the Republican Party's gallant efforts over the last six months to destroy their brand and help reelect their enemy, President Obama still trails a listless opponent in many polls. He is scoring poorly with voters on the economy. And too many independent voters dismiss him  for good reason  as a big spending liberal. To turn things around, the White House needs to follow Clinton's example and set up its GOP opponents.  <paragraph>  That will require a bold strategy and a new kind of thinking at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It will demand a big idea on long-term debt reduction and short term growth. And that bold strategy will include President Obama's strong endorsement of the Simpson-Bowles plan to save America from economic insolvency. Liberals will protest, Democratic candidates will squeal, but it is the White House's best chance to put Mitt Romney in a corner and win over independent voters.  <paragraph>  It really shouldn't be that hard considering that Mr. Obama would only be endorsing the conclusions of his own debt commission.
Chris Christie defies gravity | <paragraph>  Once upon a time, the Northeast was ruled by Republicans.  <paragraph>  Yankee politicians like New York's Teddy Roosevelt, Massachusetts' Henry Cabot Lodge, Connecticut's Prescott Bush, New Hampshire's Warren Rudman, Rhode Island's John Chafee, Maine's William Cohen and Vermont's James Jeffords represented more than a century of GOP dominance in the North that began with the presidency of Abraham Lincoln and ended with George W. Bush's election.  <paragraph>  So overwhelming was GOP dominance in New England that the Democratic Party failed to win a single presidential contest in Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine throughout the 1970s and 1980s. That reality shifted dramatically in 1992. In fact, Republicans in presidential contests have lost all states north of Virginia since 1988, other than Bush's single victory in New Hampshire in 2000.  <paragraph>  These bitter realities that face all Northeast Republicans makes New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's latest poll numbers all the more remarkable.  <paragraph>  As noted by Chris Cillizza's  The Fix , Christie’s 56 percent approval rating in a recent Fairleigh Dickinson University poll tops President Obama's standing in that state as well as the approval ratings of New Jersey's two Democratic U.S. senators. In fact, neither Bob Menendez nor Frank Lautenberg have ever registered an approval rating as high the one Christie currently enjoys.  <paragraph>  How terrifying it must be to Democratic activists in the Garden State that Republican Chris Christie is one of the most popular politicians in the recent history of their very blue state. The New Jersey governor just brokered a tough collective bargaining deal with his state's largest unions so you can expect those high approval ratings to continue for a while.  <paragraph>  There are many lessons for Republicans to take away from Christie's success:  <paragraph>  1. FOCUS ON MATH, NOT IDEOLOGY When you focus on fixing deficits by showing voters raw numbers, independents and editorial boards will follow you. When you follow your base blindly into ideological fights  like abolishing collective bargaining before your state is ready for that , you take unnecessary risks.  <paragraph>  2. THINK BIG Friends of Chris Christie never expected him to be a transformative governor. But candidate Christie knew that New Jersey's finances were so screwed up that if he got elected, his only option would be to throw all he had at knocking down the state's debt. Going to war was a risk, but his greater risk would have been to do nothing at all. As the Templar Knight at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade said,  He chose wisely.  And as I always said to politicians who came to my office seeking advice,  Nobody ever stops you when you're going 90 miles per hour.    <paragraph>  3. BE YOURSELF Chris Christie is a Jersey guy. He ain't going to be invited to the Newport Debutante Ball anytime soon. And even if he were, he'd probably decline the invitation. That's because Chris Christie is an unapologetic street fighter who doesn't bother playing nice for the cameras.  <paragraph>  Sometimes he comes across as a bully. Sometimes he talks when he should be quiet. Sometimes he might even embarrass himself. But know this: Chris Christie is always himself. And for New Jersey voters, that's good enough.
Judge unseals Liddy Watergate trial records | <paragraph>  A federal judge has ordered the release of long-sealed records relating to the 1973 trial of Watergate conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and James McCord, both of whom served as officials of President Richard Nixon's re-election bid.  <paragraph>  Chief Judge Royce Lamberth, acting on a petition from Texas A&M history professor Luke Nichter, issued an order Friday setting in motion the unsealing.  <paragraph>  Lamberth's order  posted   <hyperlink> here  unseals all records in the case apart from grand jury records, sentencing reports relating to living individuals, and  documents reflecting the contents of illegally obtained wiretaps.  The Justice Department had agreed with unsealing of the Liddy case records, aside from those three categories.  <paragraph>  In an interview Friday, Nichter hailed the judge's decision.  The National Archives has told me they have an enormous quantity of Watergate records still sealed,  the professor said.  They've told me they hope to bring these documents out of legal limbo, but you can't get them under [the Freedom of Information Act.] It takes extraordinary action by a judge to bring them out.   <paragraph>  Nichter said he believes at least some of the sealed records relate to Alfred Baldwin, a potential witness in the Libby case who was involved in wiretapping the Democratic National Committee's Watergate office that was broken into. Prosecutors sought to put Baldwin on the stand, but third-parties—apparently those overheard in the wiretaps—managed to block his testimony.  <paragraph>  Nichter said he sees little reason to keep the records sealed at this juncture.  A lot of folks involved in these events four decades ago are deceased. And, in light of later scandals, is it really necessary to keep all this secret?  he asked.  <paragraph>  Lamberth also gave the Justice Department 30 days to inventory all other sealed materials in the case and to explain why those records must remain sealed.So, more disclosures seem possible, even within the categories the Justice Department wants kept sealed.  <paragraph>  However, the judge rejected Nichter's request for a court-supervised investigation into what the professor termed breaches of grand jury secrecy by reporters for the Washington Post.  <paragraph>  Five other men were charged in the same case as Libby and McCord, but pled guilty before the trial. They included former CIA officer and White House aide E. Howard Hunt Jr. After the 16-day trial, a jury quickly convicted McCord and Liddy of conspiracy, burglary and electronic eavesdropping.  <paragraph>  Liddy was sentenced to 20-years in prison, but served a little over four years before he was paroled after receiving a commutation from President Jimmy Carter. McCord was sentenced to one to five years in that case and served about two months.
Lawsuit: Border checkpoint photo limits unconstitutional |  <paragraph>  A newly-filed lawsuit claims that a federal government policy limiting photography at border checkpoints and other points of entry to the United States violates the First Amendment.  <paragraph>  The suit was filed Wednesday in federal court in San Diego on behalf of two human rights activists who claim they were briefly detained and had their photos erased after taking pictures of border crossings in California. The four local ACLU affiliates along the U.S.-Mexico border filed the case along with  attorneys from the law firm of Morrison & Foerster.  <paragraph>  A policy of the Customs and Border Protection branch of the Department of Homeland Security prohibits photography of ports of entry without  prior approval  from a senior CBP official.  <paragraph>   This CBP policy and or practice continues to be an impermissible prior restraint on speech and to chill, deter, and infringe [plaintiffs'] First Amendment right to freedom of speech,  according to the lawsuit  posted   <hyperlink> here . <paragraph>  Lawyers pressing the suit are attempting a kind of jujitsu against the Justice Department. The suit notes that in May the Justice Department issued a letter arguing that state laws limiting photography or recording of police are unconstitutional.  Recording governmental officers engaged in public duties is a form ofspeech through which private individuals may gather and disseminate information of public concern, including the conduct of law enforcement officers,  the letter said.  <paragraph>  The issue of the right to photograph, and make audio and video recordings of police, has been a matter of contention in recent months in various parts of the country. A trend seems to be developing towards   <hyperlink> recognizing such activity as constitutionally-protected, though the local cases tend to revolve around traffic stops or arrests. <paragraph>  In response to a POLITICO query about the suit, a CBP spokesperson said Saturday:  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  CBP  cannot comment on ongoing litigation. CBP recognizes that travelers awaiting inspection at a port of entry will use electronic devices to communicate their status to family members, friends, or professional contacts. Due to security concerns, once a traveler begins the inspection process in the federal inspection station, CBP prohibits the use of these devices in order to ensure the safety of the CBP officer and the traveling public, and to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of information and the advancement of criminal activity.”  <paragraph>  However, the new lawsuit stresses that the plaintiffs, Ray Askins and Christian Ramirez, were not in the process of crossing the border when they ran into trouble with CBP. People actually crossing the border have been held to have fewer rights because of the need to search people and goods entering the U.S.  <paragraph>  Despite that distinction, if the suit is successful, it could also overturn the ban on use of cameras at customs and immigration facilities in U.S. airports. One powerful senator and avid photographer, Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, has   <hyperlink> insisted on the rights of the public to take photos at security checkpoints. Those checkpoints are controlled by another division of the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Administration.  <paragraph>  The new case has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Whelan, a Clinton appointee.  <paragraph>  UPDATE  Saturday, 4:56 P.M. : This post has been updated with a statement from Customs and Border Protection.
In pitches to troops, presidential candidates dodge and weave |  <paragraph>  In lobbying U.S. military personnel for their votes, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney sounds quite different than he did in the most recent debate, while President Barack Obama doesn't seem to want to square up with a key critique of his policy in Afghanistan.  <paragraph>  The Obama and Romney campaigns recently answered questions submitted in writing by Stars and Stripes about issues the independent, partially-federally-funded newspaper considered most of concern to soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, as well as veterans.  <paragraph>  The   <hyperlink> Romney camp's answer to Stars and Stripes on Afghanistan is striking for its contrast with what the GOP hopeful said at the foreign policy debate on Monday and in a foreign policy speech earlier this month. In the statement released to the military audience, Romney branded Obama's decision to announce a withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014 as  an enormous mistake.   <paragraph>   Gov. Romney believes it was an enormous mistake to communicate a withdrawal to our enemies as it makes our transition mission more difficult,  the statement sent to Stars and Stripes said. <paragraph>  If Romney believes that was an  enormous  error, it's odd he didn't mention it during the debate or during his speech at the Virginia Military Institute, where he alluded in vague terms to Obama decisions some people disagree with and warned against a politically-timed retreat, all while endorsing the 2014 timetable.  <paragraph>  In the debate, Romney seemed to drop his earlier talk of a 2014 withdrawal being dependent on conditions on the ground.  We'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014....We're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point,  Romney said, sounding as certain of an on-time withdrawal as Vice President Joe Biden did in his debate and more certain than Obama does, aside from this weekend off the reservation.  <paragraph>  The   <hyperlink> Obama camp's answers to Stars and Stripes also included their share of sophistry, dodging a key question about the public pull-out timetable:  Does the plan give enemy fighters an incentive to lie in wait until the U.S. leaves?  None of the sentences the Obama team provided responds directly to that point. There's also no direct response to whether the president is concerned that attacks on U.S. soldiers by Afghan personnel could so disrupt training that a successful transition could be jeopardized.
Judge speeds Fast and Furious contempt lawsuit |  <paragraph>  A House committee's lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder over his refusal to turn over some documents related to the fallout from Operation Fast and Furious will move forward at a faster pace than the parties requested, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.  <paragraph>  The Justice Department   <hyperlink> moved on Oct. 15 to throw out the lawsuit brought by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and agreed with the House panel that it's lawyers could have two months to respond to that motion. However, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected that proposal on Wednesday, saying that the House committee should file its response by Nov. 16.  <paragraph>   The Court is usually quite receptive to requests to extend the time limits imposed by the local rules, but the parties have not set forth grounds that would support the establishment of a schedule that is as expansive as this one. Moreover, the Court has determined that it is appropriate to resolve the pending motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction before establishing a schedule for the briefing and consideration of motions on the merits,  Jackson wrote. <paragraph>  Jackson said the Justice Department could reply to the House panel by Dec. 10. She also set a status hearing for Nov. 27.  <paragraph>  The lawsuit tests the authority and the willingness of the courts to intercede in a dispute between Congress and the Executive Branch over access to documents Congress says it needs to carry out its oversight responsibilities. President Barack Obama exercised executive privilege to block disclosure of the records, which detail part of the Justice Department's response to Congress and the media in the wake of the controversy over Fast and Furious, a gunrunning investigation which may have allowed as many as 2000 weapons to flow from U.S. gun dealers to Mexican drug cartels.  <paragraph>  Despite Obama's invocation of executive privilege,  <hyperlink> the House voted in June to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress and to authorize the filing of a lawsuit to compel production of the materials.
Family Research Council shooting suspect charged with terrorism |  <paragraph>  The man charged with shooting a security guard at the Washington office of the Family Research Council in August now faces a terrorism charge, federal officials announced Wednesday.  <paragraph>  Floyd Lee Corkins, II,  28, of Herndon, Va. was indicted Wednesday on ten charges, including violating District of Columbia law by committing an act of terrorism while armed. A Justice Department statement said it was the first time anyone has been charged under the District's 2002 anti-terrorism law, which defines terrorism as illegal acts undertaken to “intimidate or coerce a significant portion of the civilian population of the District of Columbia or the United States.” The offense carries a possible sentence of 30 years in prison.  <paragraph>  On Aug. 15, Corkins allegedly walked into the FRC's building at 801G Street NW, took a handgun out of a backpack and fired at an unarmed security guard, striking him in the arm. The guard subdued Corkins and was not critically injured, according to court filings.  <paragraph>  An FBI affidavit filed earlier in the case said that before opening fire Corkins said words to the effect of:  I don't like your politics.  In addition, his parents indicated he  has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner.  The Family Research Council is a prominent socially conservative organization that has opposed a variety of gay-rights measures, including same-sex marriage.  <paragraph>  Corkins's backpack contained 50 rounds of ammunition and fifteen Chick-fil-A sandwiches. The incident took place amidst publicity over Chick-fil-A executives' support for anti-same-sex marriage legislation.  <paragraph>  Corkins previously faced a federal firearms charge and two D.C. charges. Now, he faces a total of ten charges, including assault with intent to kill and attempted murder.  <paragraph>  CORRECTION: The initial version of this post indicate at one point that the victim of the shooting was killed in the attack. He was wounded but not killed.
Guilty plea in works over CIA leak | <paragraph>  Former Central Intelligence Agency officer John Kiriakou, who's accused of disclosing the identities of colleagues who interrogated suspected terrorists, may be on the verge of offering a guilty plea in the case.  <paragraph>  On Monday afternoon, an entry was added to the electronic docket of the federal court in Alexandria, Va. for a  change of plea  hearing at 11 A.M. Tuesday before U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema.  <paragraph>  Defense attorney Robert Trout declined to comment on the proposed plea, beyond confirming the docket entry.  That’s about all I’m going to say at this point,  Trout said in a brief interview Monday afternoon.  <paragraph>  Kiriakou was indicted in April on three counts of violating the Espionage Act by disclosing classified information, one count of violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act by exposing a covert officer, and one count of attempting to defraud the CIA's Publication Review Board.  <paragraph>  A source close to the case told POLITICO Monday that Kiriakou was offered a deal under which he'd plead guilty to one IIPA count and receive a sentence of two years, six months in custody. However, Kiriakou has been wavering about whether to accept it over the past week, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  <paragraph>  Last week,  <hyperlink> Brinkema canceled without explanation two important hearings scheduled in the case. Such an action often signals that a guilty plea is imminent. However, no guilty plea is final until accepted by a judge, who conducts an in-court exchange with the defendant to make sure he is certain about his wishes and fully informed of the consequences of the decision.  <paragraph>  Kiriakou's supporters say he's being persecuted because of the role he played in disclosing the CIA's use of controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding. The Justice Department has denied any such retribution is behind the charges.
George McGovern, contrarian |  <paragraph>  While some of the obituaries published Sunday for the late Sen. George McGovern  D-S.D.  claim he was an unwavering, unabashed champion of the liberal left, he sometimes strayed from liberal orthodoxy, particularly after he left politics.  <paragraph>  In 1992, McGovern, who had purchased a small inn and restaurant in Connecticut, came out for tort reform.  <paragraph>   Despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone else. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is frightening,  McGovern wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed  non-paywalled text   <hyperlink> here.   <paragraph>  And in 2008, McGovern denounced so-called card-check legislation pushed by large labor unions and endorsed by almost everyone in the Democratic Party establishment.  <paragraph>   Workers in developing countries such as Mexico insist on the secret ballot when voting as to whether or not their workplaces should have a union,  McGovern wrote, again on the Wall Street Journal's op-ed page  excerpts   <hyperlink> here .  We should have no less for employees in our country.   <paragraph>  That fall, McGovern went so far as to tape a 60-second TV ad for opponents of the labor-backed card check measure, known as the Employee Free Choice Act.  <paragraph>   It's hard to believe that any politician would agree to a law denying millions of employees the right to a private vote,  McGovern said in   <hyperlink> the TV spot.  This proposed law cannot be justified. Working families deserve a voice and a private vote. I'm Sen. George McGovern and I approved this message because democracy is something that should never be sacrificed. 
Judge: Prisoners of U.S. in Afghanistan can't sue |  <paragraph>  Non-Afghan prisoners held by the U.S. military in Afghanistan cannot seek their freedom in U.S. courts, a federal judge reaffirmed in a ruling Friday.  <paragraph>  U.S. District Judge John Bates rejected arguments by lawyers for so-called third-country nationals that new circumstances and evidence about their detention at the Bagram Air Base near Kabul merited allowing them to pursue habeas corpus petitions in American courts.  <paragraph>   Petitioners must resort to the argument that the transfer of some detainees to the Afghan government makes it less likely that other detainees will someday be transferred, even though the United States continues to reaffirm its goal of transferring custody of all detainees. But as a matter of logic, petitioners' argument makes little sense. Indeed, one could convincingly argue that the opposite is true,  Bates wrote in his 24-page decision  posted   <hyperlink> here .  <paragraph>  In April 2009, Bates issued a landmark ruling that non-Afghan prisoners captured outside the country and taken to Bagram had the right to pursue habeas cases in U.S. courts. In May 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned his decision, but left open the door to further proceedings if circumstances changed.  <paragraph>  In his ruling Friday, Bates also labeled as  largely cumulative of evidence previously submitted  declarations from former government officials arguing that the foreign prisoners were likely moved to Afghanistan to evade judicial review.  <paragraph>  The Obama administration has fought hard against allowing prisoners at Bagram to pursue the same kind of habeas cases Guantanamo prisoners can, despite President Barack Obama's statements during the 2008 campaign decrying the Bush administration for using Guantanamo as a  legal black hole.  The Obama administration has set up Detainee Review Boards in Afghanistan which the administration insists are more robust than the administrative procedures the Bush administration used for Guantanamo before the Supreme Court ruled that prisoners there have habeas rights. <paragraph>  Afghans held by the U.S. at Bagram also cannot sue in U.S. courts, but that issue has been less disputed because of legal precedent saying the courts should stay out of that issue, at least as long as U.S. forces are in combat in Afghanistan against the Taliban. Control of the Parwan detention facility at Bagram was partially transferred to the Afghan government in September, but both   <hyperlink> Afghan and third-country prisoners have remained under U.S. control.  <paragraph>  A deal to handover the prison that was key to Obama'a May visit to Afghanistan, but has since been thrown into doubt by a series of disagreements between the U.S. and Afghan authorities.
Parsing Obama on Guantanamo | <paragraph>  What exactly did President Barack Obama mean when he suggested Thursday that Congress needs to do more to establish a  legal architecture  to govern aspects of the war on terror?  <paragraph>   One thing we have got to do is put a legal architecture in place and we need congressional help do that to make sure that not only am I reined in, but any president's reigned in, in terms of some of the decisions that we’re making,  Obama told Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's  Daily Show.   <paragraph>  Obama made the comment just after he mentioned Guantanamo, so it seemed he may have been referring to some type of legislation to regulate the detention of war on terror prisoners. The remark echoed something the president said more than three years ago, in   <hyperlink> his only speech he devoted to the issue as president.  <paragraph>   If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.  And so, going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution,  Obama said in May 2009.  <paragraph>  If that's what the president was talking about Thursday, it's a bit perplexing because the Obama administration  <hyperlink> decided later in 2009 not to pursue such legislation, even though   <hyperlink> officials determined that 48 of the men at Gitmo needed to be held indefinitely without trial.  <paragraph>  In August 2010,  <hyperlink> Sen. Lindsey Graham  R-S.C.  filed a bill that would have had Congress set some rules for the process of long-term detention of alleged terrorists. The administration, which had been   <hyperlink> negotiating intensely with Graham months earlier, didn't take a position on the measure, which essentially went nowhere.  <paragraph>  Last year, Congress passed a bill that appeared to give its general endorsement to the procedures the courts have worked out to review the detention of Guantanamo prisoners. Obama initially   <hyperlink> threatened to veto that measure, but   <hyperlink> relented after it was watered down. He also signed that and several other measures that effectively made it impossible for him to carry through on his plan to close Guantanamo.  <paragraph>  Throughout the discussions last year, administration officials signaled that they would have preferred Congress not dig into the issue. However, Obama may have been alluding to hopes some in the administration had early in their talks with Graham that a  grand bargain  might have been possible that would have combined closing Guantanamo with passing detention-related legislation. Those hopes were well dashed by last year and officials seemed uninterested in engaging on detailed detention-related legislation with Congress so stridently opposed to closing Guantanamo and bringing some of its prisoners to the U.S.  <paragraph>  It's conceivable Obama's comment to Stewart was about legislation to give a legal imprimatur to surveillance President George W. Bush untilaterally authorized. But that doesn't make a great deal of sense. Congress passed such legislation in 2008, while Obama was still a senator. Obama's Thursday comments were clearly directed at some kind of unfinished business with Congress.  <paragraph>  It's also possible the president was referring to legislation to regulate the process by which the U.S. authorizes the use of lethal force against individual terrorists abroad, particularly Americans. But the administration has insisted that the internal, secret process the White House, Defense Department and Central Intelligence Agency use to make those kinds of decisions is adequate to the task and has resisted efforts to involve the courts. In fact, Obama suggested later in the interview that a  legal structure and safeguards  were in place on that front. <paragraph>  The White House didn't immediately respond to a query late Thursday seeking more detail about what kind of  legal architecture  Obama wants Congress to put in place relating to terrorism.  <paragraph>  Here's an extended excerpt of the 'Daily Show  exchange: “Obama: There are some things that we haven't gotten done. I still want to close Guantanamo. We haven’t been able to get that through Congress. one thing we have got to do is put a legal architecture in place and we need congressional help do that to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in in terms of some of the decisions that we’re making. There are tough tradeoffs. Sometimes there's bad folks on the other side of the world and you have to make a call and it's not optimal but when you look at our track record what we've been able to do is to say we ended the war in Iraq, we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, we've gone after Al Qaeda and its leadership. it's true Al Qaeda's still active, at least sort of remnants of it, are staging in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Sometimes you have to make tough calls but you can do so in a way that's consistent with international and American law. Stewart: Within that as it ratchets down, i think people have been surprised to see the strength of the Bush-era warrantless wire-tapping laws and those types of things not also be lessened. The strictures that he put in place tthat people might have thought were government overreach and that maybe they had the mind you would perhaps tone down, you haven't. Obama: Well, the truth is we actually have modified them and built a legal structure and safeguards that are in place. That weren't there before on a whole range of issues Now, they're not real sexy issues... Stewart: You don’t know what I find sexy.”
Feds win round in CIA leak case |  <paragraph>  Prosecutors pursuing former CIA officer John Kiriakou for allegedly leaking the identities of two other CIA officers involved in interrogating terror suspects need not prove that Kiriakou intended to harm the United States or help a foreign nation, a federal judge ruled in an opinion made public Wednesday.  <paragraph>  The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema is a defeat for Kiriakou's defense, which asked the judge to insist on the stronger level of proof — which most likely would have been very difficult for the government to muster. <paragraph>  In 2006, another federal judge in the same Northern Virginia courthouse, T.S. Ellis, imposed the higher requirement in a criminal case against two former lobbyists for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.  <paragraph>  However, Brinkema said that situation was not parallel to that of Kiriakou, since he is accused of relaying information he learned as a CIA officer and the AIPAC staffers were not in the government at the time they were alleged to have received and passed on classified information.  <paragraph>   Kiriakou was a government employee trained in the classification system who could appreciate the significance of the information he allegedly disclosed. Accordingly, there can be no question that Kiriakou was on clear notice of the illegality of his alleged communications. The facts thus clearly differentiate his case  from that of the ex-AIPAC officials, the judge wrote in her 13-page ruling  posted   <hyperlink> here .  <paragraph>  Brinkema also noted that a federal appeals court suggested the rule Ellis established in the AIPAC case, which was dropped in 2009 before trial, may have been erroneous.  One district court judge's ruling is not binding upon another, even in the same district.   <paragraph>  The gist of Brinkema's ruling was indicated in footnotes to   <hyperlink> a defense filing made public last week and   <hyperlink> reported Monday by Secrecy News. However, the text of her ruling was not released until Wednesday.  <paragraph>  Brinkema's ruling focused on the Epsionage Act counts Kiriakou is facing for allegedly disclosing classified information. He is also charged with revealing the identity of a covert officer and with defrauding the CIA's Publications Review Board by giving it inaccurate information.  <paragraph>  On Tuesday, Brinkema abruptly postponed a major motions hearing in the case set for Wednesday and a hearing set for Thursday on journalists' motions to quash subpoenas from the defense. She gave no reason for canceling the hearings.  <paragraph>  The Washington Post's Julie Tate and freelancer Matt Cole are both fighting subpoenas served on them. A third subpoena, served on The New York Times's Scott Shane, was dropped, a New York Times spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.  <paragraph>  UPDATE  Thursday, 12:32 A.M. : This post has been updated with information from the Times and to clarify a reference to the timing of events in the case.
The Original Coal Country | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Kari Lydersen recently spent a week in England reporting on coal mining and coalfield communities through a Climate Media Fellowship from the Heinrich Boll Foundation North America. Three profiles to come will feature coalfield figures bridging the past and present of this once-mighty industry. <PARAGRAPH> WAKEFIELD, YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND—Years after the closures of the coal mines where he once worked, Andy Smith still dons his mining gear nearly every day and heads underground. During breaks he hangs out with other miners, covered in coal dust and grime, in a grungy small locker room where they make bawdy jokes in thick Scottish and Yorkshire accents almost unintelligible to an outsiders. <PARAGRAPH> Smith and his colleagues are guides at the National Coal Mining Museum in Wakefield, one of the many “coalfield communities” in Yorkshire in central England. Nearly all of the underground coalmines in these parts, which used to employ tens of thousands of miners, have closed—the victim of competition from cheaper imported coal and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s concerted attack on the once-powerful National Union of Mineworkers. <PARAGRAPH> The brutal yearlong strike of 1984-1985 turned coalfield communities into virtual war zones. The union opposed a systematic mine-closure plan and the government’s attempts to gut their labor rights. Former miners and their families describe the stand-off even now as if it was yesterday: police roadblocks where people were pulled out of vehicles and beaten; scores of picketing miners severely injured by nightsticks and kicks to the head; miners’ families barely scraping by with no heat in their homes and little food; and bitter conflict between the majority of striking miners and those who continued working. <PARAGRAPH> Though the strike was ultimately a failure—many of the mines closed for good over the following decade -- it was also a time of ecstatic solidarity and revolt. Miners and their wives traveled the country and even internationally, speaking about their struggle. Support poured in from around England and abroad. And women who previously saw their most important duty as having dinner on the table for their husbands were suddenly organizing and protesting autonomously. The group Women Against Pit Closures played a crucial role in the labor movement. <PARAGRAPH> In Yorkshire today there are few visual reminders of the strike or the legendary coal mining industry that once powered much of the country and formed the bedrock for thriving, rough-but-close-knit “pit towns.” They were known for their vibrant, distinct cultures, including raising pigeons and ferrets, playing rugby and football, and throwing annual galas and local “welfare societies” that made sure families’ needs were met. <PARAGRAPH> “My father raised greyhounds; people raised pigeons and had gardens; on holidays as a kid you could go around and the retired miners would give you tea and a sandwich,” recalls Willy McGranahan, a former miner, originally from Scotland, who serves as deputy director at the mining museum.  “The pit was more than just a job, it was a way of life. That’s gone now, people are more isolated.” <PARAGRAPH> “It’s sad,” adds miner-turned-museum guide David Halsted, nicknamed “Chewbacca” for his striking resemblance to the Star Wars character. “It’s very much like being in the army, you look after your friends and colleagues and they look after you. That time spent in village working men’s clubs, in pubs—that social togetherness is all gone.” <PARAGRAPH> Most of the mine infrastructure was dismantled shortly after pits  as underground mines in England are called  were closed, and now most of the spoil heaps—composed of waste rock and detritus—are covered in grass and blend into the landscape. <PARAGRAPH>  A full generation has passed since the mine closures, and another generation is growing up. As intrinsic as mining has been to the area’s identity, collective memories fade. A major goal of the National Coal Mining Museum and smaller museums in individual coalfield communities is to keep alive the history of mining and what it meant to people and communities in places like Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Durham. <PARAGRAPH> Smith and the other miners who now work as tour guides say they love their jobs, where they are still spending their days in a mine but imparting knowledge rather than extracting coal. They lead visitors through a sprawling stretch of the former working underground mine known as Caphouse. In the underground mine, equipment from throughout the ages and surprisingly lifelike statues of humans depict the working conditions of miners from the Victorian era on. <PARAGRAPH> Working conditions for the miners in the 1800s—from the Victorian Era through the Industrial Revolution—were truly shocking, even given the generally hellish conditions for workers in those days. Families worked as teams, spending much of their life on their hands and knees toiling in near-complete darkness. <PARAGRAPH> Statues in the mine tour illustrate how men would hack coal loose from the walls from a sitting or lying position, while their wives would crawl on all fours, pulling or pushing the coal in a wooden cart, originally without wheels, fastened by chains around their waists. The couples worked with only a small candle, purchased like their other equipment from the landowner. They would mine in chambers blocked by a wooden door to guard against gas explosions. Children as young as 6 also worked in the mines. <PARAGRAPH> In 1842, women and children under 10 were banned from working underground, so they were replaced with the famous “pit ponies,” who often lived their whole lives underground. Conditions improved greatly after the mines were nationalized in 1947, and miners and pit ponies were granted two weeks off a year. Fatalities dropped from 357 per 100,000 workers in 1886 to 30 in 1971, according to the Yorkshire mining history Remembering How it Was, by editor and labor journalist Granville Williams. <PARAGRAPH> While Smith marvels at the primitive and terrifying conditions under which the Victorians labored, he and other 20th-century miners spent countless hours working in a way that was not so different: lying prone in seams just 20 inches high, harvesting coal by hand  albeit with electric tools . <PARAGRAPH> Smith said, “I have bad knees. A lot of people have bad backs, vibration white finger”  blood vessel constriction and nerve damage from holding vibrating drills . Not to mention, of course, black lung disease and other disabling respiratory ailments. <PARAGRAPH> Many former miners have contradictory feelings about their past work—they miss the camaraderie, the feeling of purpose, the challenge; and they are infuriated by the political decision to leave millions of tons of coal unharvested belowground. But they shake their heads in awe of what they used to do. <PARAGRAPH> “I worked under this table for 20 years,” said Harry Malkin to a gathering of former miners at Williams’ home, gesturing to the several-foot-high space below the dinner table. Now Malkin makes his living as an artist, including creating memorials for laid off and killed miners. “I must have been out of my mind. We were crawling around in a Victorian atmosphere, eating where you crap, crapping where you eat.  It was not even Victorian, more like Neanderthal.” <PARAGRAPH> The museum’s underground tour also tracks mining technology as it evolved to extract more and more coal with less and less manpower. Smith worked on the massive machines used in larger seams which became increasingly common after the 1960s, known as the “long wall” method. Smith operated a series of hydraulic posts to keep the mine ceiling from caving in, while a giant machine on caterpillar tracks chewed away coal, dumping it onto a conveyor belt. As the machine crept along underground, large sections of the roof were allowed to collapse behind it. This caused the “surface subsidence” seen in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and many other coal-mining areas—where the earth sinks or caves in, causing houses on the surface to crack and slump. <PARAGRAPH> England’s coal-fired power plants are now supplied with coal largely from high-tech, massive open-pit mines in other countries, including the Cerrejon in Colombia, where no tunneling is needed. Gigantic machines simply gouge out huge swaths of earth and then remove the coal, with relatively few workers involved. Coal exporter Australia has pioneered unmanned mining machinery, and analysts say that the future of Australia’s coal industry lies in highly automated mines deep underground where production levels could dwarf anything seen today. <PARAGRAPH> The mass importing of coal irks miners such as Malkin—not only because it meant the decimation of their union and their proud industry, but also because they’ve heard about the labor, human rights and environmental debacles in many of the mining industries from which Britain imports coal. These include indigenous communities brutally displaced for mine expansions, children working hard jobs without adequate safety equipment, contaminated water and shorn-off mountaintops. <PARAGRAPH> “I believe in the market economy, but we’re importing coal from Peru and Colombia, places with almost slave labor,” said Halsted. “That’s wrong.”
Lessons From Essen: What the U.S. Rust Belt Can Learn From Germany | <PARAGRAPH> ESSEN, GERMANY—Stephan Haas has probably given this spiel hundreds of times, but he still sparkles with enthusiasm and mischievous wit as he tells the tale of the notorious Krupp family, the German magnates who helped make this area the heart of German industry. Speaking English for the benefit of French and Finnish visitors, Haas describes how Friedrich Krupp caused a scandal by reportedly seducing boys in Italy and how his wife Margaret was committed to a “madhouse” when her complaints about her husband became inconvenient. He shows visitors around the imposing Krupp mansion, slyly critiquing the architecture, and explains the company town known as Margarethenhöhe, which houses Krupp managerial workers. <PARAGRAPH> Krupp’s company, now the multinational ThyssenKrupp, is still based in Essen in the Ruhr region in northwestern Germany, where the smokestacks of steel mills, coal-fired power plants and factories still rise above the otherwise lush green fields and hills. But over the past decades, much of the steel and coal industries once located here have closed up, along with the underground coal mines that in the 1950s employed 470,000 and now employ only about 30,000. Of more than 200 underground mines that once supplied 125 million tons of coal a year, only a handful remain open and they are all scheduled for closure by 2018. Because of the offshoring of industry and the import of cheaper coal from Colombia, Poland and South Africa, the Ruhr region now has among the country’s highest levels of unemployment and economic distress.  Though it is still noticeably more prosperous than much of western Europe and the United States; Germany has weathered the economic crisis better than most.  <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> “It used to be that miners were the underground kings, everyone respected them, this whole region was built by coal,” says Haas. “But now if you say you are a miner, you wouldn’t get the same response you used to. The memory is fading, and the miners are disappearing like dinosaurs.” <PARAGRAPH>  A significant mining industry still remains southwest of the Ruhr region around the town of Duren, near Cologne, but that is the strip-mining of soft, dirty “brown coal” burned in nearby power plants run by the company RWE. Activists and local legislators who oppose the industry note that it employs relatively few people, because the massive strip mines are largely automated, and causes huge amounts of pollution that endanger public health and contribute to climate change.  <PARAGRAPH> Like some former industrial and mining areas in the United States, civic leaders in the Ruhr region have tried to rebrand the area as a mecca for arts, culture and tourism, celebrating the rich industrial history  and now-lower levels of pollution . Their plan got a major boost in 2010 when the European Commission named the area a “European Capital of Culture,” a designation created in 1985 as a means to promote European cohesiveness and boost an area’s tourism and economic vitality. Since then, millions of visitors from the rest of Germany, Europe and beyond have toured new modern art museums and historical sites in towns and cities like Essen, Mulheim, Dortmund and Duisburg. The idea was that the region’s new identity could create tourism-related and other service-economy jobs and attract new high tech and other businesses to locate while maintaining a role for the heavy industry that does still exist. The region has also gained tens of thousands of jobs related to renewable energy, according to regional Green Party elected officials, since solar power installation and manufacturing  and to a lesser degree wind power  has boomed in Germany in the past few years. It helps that the Ruhr region, in part because of its industrial heritage, is home to 20 universities, including top technical institutes. <PARAGRAPH> A massive former mine and coking plant called Zollverein is a prime example of the region’s transformation. Zollverein once consisted of almost 100 miles of underground tunnels and railroads that descended almost a mile deep, where tens of thousands of miners working in often horrifying conditions extracted many millions of tons of coal from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s. Much of the mine infrastructure and the central coking plant sprawling across the surface of the mine have been preserved. They now appear sculptural and surreal: soaring towers capped with wheels that pulled coal out of the earth; maze-like networks of conveyor belts and rail tracks; shining boilers, cylinders and cooling towers that are beautiful in abstract and geometric ways; even a carnivalesque contraption reminiscent of a Ferris wheel rising above the coking ovens, which were closed in 1993. <PARAGRAPH> The Ruhr Museum, depicting the region’s history from prehistoric times to the present, is housed in the old coal wash house, and events from alternative energy conferences to weddings are held in countless converted conference rooms and reception halls onsite. Another former mining structure houses the highly regarded Red Dot Design Museum, while old coal buildings are also home to smaller art galleries and studios and a revolving schedule of concerts and performances. <PARAGRAPH> Also tapping the Ruhr’s regional heritage is the Bergbau Mining Museum in nearby Bochum, which was founded in 1930 and got a major boost thanks to the Capital of Culture.  More than a million people annually peruse a vast and eclectic mix of mining paraphernalia, artifacts and art. The collection, hard to see in a single day, includes hundreds of different miners’ lanterns from over the decades, a plethora of quirky dioramas and several rooms packed with mineral samples from around the world. <PARAGRAPH> The high quality, efficiently run museums and tourism services in the Ruhr region provide an inspiration for U.S. Rust Belt towns trying to stimulate tourism and culture to replace the mining and manufacturing jobs that have disappeared. But the Ruhr region also shows that even a thriving tourism and culture industry provides a relatively small amount of direct employment, with the jobs directly created across a whole region unlikely to ever match the jobs lost at even one mass employer like acoal mine or steel mill. Jobs may be created in restaurants, shops and the like, but most tourists still move through the region in a matter of several days, so the economic ripple effects of popular museums and cultural institutions do not appear to be wide. Various people working in the area said that the European Capital of Culture designation brought a wave of attention and economic stimulus, but didn’t create significant lasting changes in the area’s identity or economics. <PARAGRAPH> And this is all in a place like western Germany where tourists from other relatively well-off countries can regularly and easily travel. Luring visitors to a remote former mining village in Colorado or a notorious post-industrial city like Gary, Indiana, is an entirely different story. <PARAGRAPH> A more realistic replacement for the lost jobs might revolve around clean energy. The German Green Party claims that in little more than a decade renewable energy has created 380,000 jobs, thanks to government policies like the feed-in tariff that promotes it. A significant portion of these jobs are located in the Ruhr region. For former U.S. industrial areas that still have infrastructure and skilled workers, such green jobs could be a better bet than tourism and culture in terms of employment, although, as in the Ruhr region, the two approaches can complement each other. <PARAGRAPH> But the well-being of a region or a city has to do with more than its employment statistics and economic indicators. Pride in place and history and the cultural, artistic and social resources that are available to local residents and draw visitors surely have benefits beyond the economic bottom-line. The Southeast Environmental Task Force in Chicago had tried to turn a former coking plant on the city’s far south side into a museum before the structure was ultimately demolished. The group had failed to get the adequate funds or political and institutional support for their project. Wandering the grounds of Zollverein, I couldn’t help but think of the shame that a similar  if smaller scale  opportunity in an economically struggling community in Chicago was squandered. But countless opportunities still exist; hopefully U.S. leaders and regular residents can take inspiration from places like Zollverein to create monuments that provide some economic stimulation and pay tribute to U.S. workers and industries of years past. <PARAGRAPH> Kari Lydersen is spending two weeks in Germany and the United Kingdom thanks to a Climate Media Fellowship from the Heinrich Böll Foundation North America. She'll be reporting on renewable energy, past and current coal mining regions, and the role of coal and renewables in these countries’ energy futures.
Lawsuit Sheds Light on Murky and Dangerous Warehouse Sector | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Working In These Times has frequently covered the warehousing industry and the way that complicated layers of different companies using, owning, operating and staffing warehouses make the sector ripe for labor abuse. <PARAGRAPH> A motion for sanctions filed August 23 in a workers’ class action lawsuit against southern California Wal-Mart warehouses sheds more light on this structure and alleges that defendant Schneider Logistics failed to provide legally mandated evidence to avoid culpability for workers’ wages and working conditions. <PARAGRAPH> Last October, workers affiliated with the group Warehouse Workers United filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. district court in California alleging labor law violations at Mira Loma warehouses operated solely for Wal-Mart stores. The lawsuit names Schneider Logistics Inc.  SLI  and its subsidiary Schneider Logistics Transloading and Distribution  STLD  along with the companies Impact and Premier, which hired people to staff the warehouses. Schneider took over operation of the warehouses in 2006. <PARAGRAPH> The initial complaint said: <PARAGRAPH> Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated to recover the wages that defendants stole — and are continuing to steal — from them in violation of federal and California law. Plaintiffs also seek redress for other consequences of defendants’ unlawful conspiracy, including defendants’ wrongful scheme to hide and then cover up the extent of their wrongdoing by failing to keep mandatory payroll records, falsifying records of hours worked and compensation owed, and concealing, denying and or misrepresenting to the workers the amount of their earnings and on what basis these earnings were calculated. <PARAGRAPH> A key question is whether Schneider or STLD directly employed--and is therefore responsible for the working conditions of--the plaintiffs, including lead plaintiff Everardo Carrillo. The plaintiffs allege that Schneider is their “joint employer” along with the other defendants. <PARAGRAPH> Schneider Logistics initially argued that it had “no connection with or responsibility for the operation, oversight, or supervision” of the workers at the Mira Loma warehouses, as quoted in the recent motion. It notes that Schneider Logistics Secretary-Treasurer Amy Schilling signed a sworn declaration saying the company had “no business or contractual relationship” with co-defendants Impact and Premier. And the motion alleges that Schneider sought to continue this image by failing to turn over documents during the discovery process that would have indicated otherwise. <PARAGRAPH> In April Schneider attorneys responded to a discovery request without actually looking for the requested documents, according to the motion. In other words, they allegedly were either sloppy or intentionally avoided turning over evidence to which the plaintiffs have a legal right. <PARAGRAPH> This became clear when documents turned over by Impact and Premier included highly relevant Schneider documents which Schneider attorneys had specifically said did not exist. The motion notes: <PARAGRAPH> Schneider has now produced thousands of documents it previously claimed did not exist, including over 12,100 pages of personnel files it maintained for the Impact and Premier class members  whom it claims not to jointly employ , and the workplace rules and training requirements it imposed on all class members. <PARAGRAPH> The plaintiffs say the new documents show that “Schneider’s top managers knowingly made material false statements” to the court, including claims that the warehouse employees are not subject to Schneider employment policies and that Schneider does not keep personnel files on them or set productivity quotas. The documents showed that Schilling herself signed contracts with Premier and Impact, on behalf of STLD and “its affiliates.” Meanwhile, Schilling is also vice president and controller of Schneider National, the parent company of the other Schneider groups, which actually negotiated the contracts with Impact and Premier. <PARAGRAPH> Once it was clear that Schneider did indeed have contracts with Impact and Premier, General Manager Vince Redgrave told the court that the contracts gave Schneider no say over work terms or conditions. The court ordered that Schneider actually produce the contracts, and when it did, as the motion says, “they proved the exact opposite of what Vince Redgrave had testified.” <PARAGRAPH> The federal district judge, Christina Snyder, wrote in a preliminary injunction ruling that the “contracts dictate nearly every material term of plaintiffs’ employment including how Impact and PWV  Premier  must conduct pre-employment screening and new employment training.” <PARAGRAPH> The documents also showed that, contrary to Redgrave’s previous testimony, Schneider did set specific productivity quotas for the warehouse workers and in fact complained to Premier when the rate of cases unloaded per hour dropped. Schneider officials also talked about how to remedy Impact’s “low productivity levels.” <PARAGRAPH> Warehouse worker groups have long argued that unrealistic and escalating productivity quotas are among the things that lead to high chronic and acute injury rates in warehouses. In July, Warehouse Workers United filed a complaint with California’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration office. <PARAGRAPH> The recent motion also alleges that Schneider or its attorneys did not order employees to preserve emails relevant to the case, as is standard required legal procedure. It says the company has an automatic delete email function for emails from the Mira Loma warehouses, meaning emails are deleted automatically after a short period of time, and employees also have “absolute discretion” over whether to save or delete emails. The motion says Schneider was slow to issue a memo instating a “litigation hold”—meaning employees should preserve relevant communications. And it alleges even after such a memo was issued, Schneider never enforced it. <PARAGRAPH> The motion also alleges that Schneider destroyed and denied the existence of security camera footage that would aid the plaintiffs’ case. The motion demands that Schneider turn over video footage and also a log of any video that has been destroyed since October 2011. <PARAGRAPH> The motion asks that the court make note of Schneider’s alleged misconduct, tell Schneider that further misconduct will result in sanctions, and provide relevant attorneys’ fees and costs to the plaintiffs. It notes that the court could also decide to inform a jury of Schneider’s false statements and other discovery violations, and asks that the court establish a “rebuttal presumption” that Schneider is indeed a “joint employer” of the plaintiffs. <PARAGRAPH> Overall, the lawsuit is part of WWU’s and individual workers’ ongoing campaign to improve conditions in warehouses and shed light on the complicated employment structure that allows major companies like Wal-Mart to benefit from the low-paid, dangerous work of a largely temporary workforce.
City Janitors Are Latest To Feel Sting of Emanuel’s Cost-Cutting | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO—Pam Broughton worked for eight years as a janitor at the Fifth District police station on the city's far south side. As of this spring she was making $15.45 an hour with benefits. But then as a cost-cutting measure, the city accepted a bid from a different contractor that offered to clean the station more cheaply than Nationwide Maintenance, the contracting company that employed Broughton. <PARAGRAPH> The new company, Dayspring Janitorial Services, told workers that if they wanted to keep their jobs they would have to agree to $12 an hour, no benefits and more part-time work, Broughton says. She said the workers, members of the Service Employees International Union  SEIU  Local 1, accepted the conditions “because we needed jobs.” <PARAGRAPH> Even so, Broughton’s last day of work was June 29. <PARAGRAPH> Broughton says she never got a straight answer from the city or Dayspring about whether she would be able to keep her job. About 50 union janitors were laid off as the city granted contracts to Dayspring to clean south side police stations, health clinics, senior centers and administrative satellite offices. Others were rehired by Dayspring, but will see their pay drop from $24,100 to $31,000 a year currently, depending on their seniority, to a maximum of $23,800 per year with Dayspring.  It is also unclear whether the rehired workers will have health insurance; the union said Dayspring is still negotiating with the city on this point. Many of those laid off had been in their jobs for decades. <PARAGRAPH> Broughton and seven other janitors at the fifth district station were laid off despite a letter from Station Commander Patricia Walsh saying they were “dependable and conscientious in fulfilling their daily responsibilities…also very responsive to the special maintenance requests and cleaning needs of the 5th District personnel.” <PARAGRAPH> Union leaders say the janitors’ situation shows how the city bidding system lends itself to union-busting. Hence Broughton and other janitors and supporters rallied at Chicago City Hall on Wednesday to demand that the city council hold a hearing on the Responsible Bidders Ordinance, which would mandate contractors doing business with the city prove that they have not violated federal or state labor law and that they are paying the prevailing industry wage. <PARAGRAPH>They note that Dayspring has a history of alleged and proven labor law violations under past county contracts, including citations from the National Labor Relations Board for “intimidating, coercing, discriminating and illegally terminating its employees in order to prevent them from speaking with and joining a union,” as summed up in a union press release.  The NLRB settled with Dayspring on those charges.  Dayspring was also charged with violating state policy by not paying prevailing wage rates while working under a 2007 contract cleaning county health clinics. The company paid $11.15 per hour, while prevailing wage was set at $11.40 for new employees and up to $14.80 for longer-term workers. <PARAGRAPH> “For eight months we were corresponding with the city about Dayspring’s record,” says SEIU spokesperson Izabela Miltko “Either a  they made a huge mistake or b  they sought out this contractor ultimately looking to get rid of the union.” <PARAGRAPH> The ordinance would apply to all contracts over $50,000 for window-washing, security and janitorial services, and would require companies pay a prevailing wage, comply with labor law and carry workers compensation and other crucial insurance. It would disqualify companies with past labor law violations or multiple violations of the prevailing wage standard. It would also mandate that no existing employees be replaced by a new contractor during a 45-day transition period; and if people are laid off during this period, it must be done on the basis of seniority. <PARAGRAPH> The ordinance has the support of 31 out of the city’s 50 aldermen, according to the union, but it needs to be called for a committee hearing in order to go to a full Council vote. So far that has not happened, and the way things go in Chicago it also needs the mayor’s support. <PARAGRAPH> “We’ll deliver our message to Mr. Emanuel, we’ll tell him to look for savings elsewhere, not in our pockets because our pockets are almost empty,” says Ewa Miklewicz, a janitor and union member for more than three decades. <PARAGRAPH> Unions see the ordinance as especially important as the city is under intense budget pressure and expected to privatize more city services, meaning more contractors will be hired. Currently union janitors at the city’s two airports are also worried about losing their jobs. A contract for janitorial services at O’Hare International airport recently expired and a leading bid by the company United Maintenance Company Inc. would reportedly mean about 340 SEIU Local 1 janitors lose their jobs. Union president Tom Balanoff told the Chicago Tribune that company officials told him they would hire their own, likely non-union workers. <PARAGRAPH> “Every time you look up, a little part of the city workforce has been chopped away,” says Charles Brown, a former police officer who lives in the Englewood neighborhood on the city’s south side and who attended the janitors’ rally. “Chicago has a wonderful tradition of valuing hard work. Public contractors should not be leading the race to the bottom, the public workforce should set the standards…These  janitors  had good jobs and they were nice ladies and gentlemen. This irresponsible company hired replacement workers and didn’t honor the terms of their contract. And so far the city hasn’t done a D-A-M-N thing.” <PARAGRAPH> The union charges that based on their research, even with the low wages, Dayspring will not be able to fulfill the terms it promised the city in its bid. The union says the company also didn’t follow the law in considering prevailing wages in its bid proposal. On June 8 the union filed a Freedom of Information Act with the city for documents related to the bid. Though FOIAs must legally be answered within seven working days, the union says they have still received no response. <PARAGRAPH> “It’s obvious Mayor Emanuel is not going to do the right thing on his own, so we have to push him,” says organizer Laura Garza. <PARAGRAPH> The letter to the mayor cited the plight of Catalina Bojorquez, a janitor for three years at the city’s 63rd Street police station who lost her job and her health insurance with the contract switch. She recently discovered she has an ovarian tumor and may need surgery. <PARAGRAPH> Broughton is now surviving on $167 a month in disability payments—or barely surviving, since she has diabetes and no health insurance. <PARAGRAPH> “We’re asking the mayor to pass this ordinance so I can get my job back,” she told the crowd outside city hall. “I like my job.”
Illinois Unions Fight Prison Closures | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> In Illinois, the battle over slated prison closings is highlighting how unions that represent prison guards can find themselves at odds with the push to reform a discriminatory and overly punitive criminal-justice system. Several prisons and juvenile detention facilities are currently scheduled for closing as part of Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn’s attempts to close the state’s budget hole. But AFSCME, the public sector union representing guards and other correctional workers, says that closing these facilities will cause overcrowding and dangerous conditions at other institutions. <PARAGRAPH> One of the prisons slated for closure is Tamms, a controversial super-max facility in southern Illinois that has long been the target of a shutdown campaign by family members and activists. For years, many demanded Tamms be closed because of the harsh solitary confinement conditions and the documented extreme physical and mental impacts on inmates. It appears that what these human-rights arguments did not achieve, the budget crisis now has. <PARAGRAPH> But prison guards and union leaders say the closure of Tamms, Dwight  the state’s only women’s prison  and transitional facilities will make conditions more dangerous and difficult for prison workers. and by extension, for inmates. <PARAGRAPH> According to prison-reform advocates, Illinois’s system is designed for 34,000 inmates but currently holds more than 48,000, forcing inmates to bunk in hallways and closets. Increasing crowding and mixing in new people with various gang affiliations could be an explosive mix, AFSCME has noted. <PARAGRAPH> State officials disagree, as reported by the Chicago Tribune: <PARAGRAPH> “The Illinois Department of Corrections, however, argues that there is ‘no statistical relationship between population, staffing levels or closures, and violence.’ The department released data showing inmate assaults on guards dropped from 502 to 444 during the budget year that ended June 30.” <PARAGRAPH> Another point worth noting is that inmate numbers may decrease in the long term. Crime is declining in general, and more state and local governments are moving toward alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent crimes and toward decriminalizing minor marijuana charges. <PARAGRAPH> Because of the rift between unions and the state on this issue, the union says, the Illinois State Police have retaliated against union prison guards at Tamms by searching them with pat-downs at the end of shifts, among other things. The searches allegedly started in July, right after guards testified at the state capital about the risks of prison closings and inmate transfers, according to AFSCME. Union spokesperson Anders Lindall says the searches “reek of retaliatory harassment.” <PARAGRAPH> The maximum-security prisoners from Tamms will be transferred to other prisons, including Pontiac and Menard in southern Illinois. Cells will be upgraded at a cost of as much as $50,000 each to accommodate the maximum-security prisoners.
Romney’s Bain in the Ass | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> As throngs of eager Republicans and the rains of Tropical Storm Isaac have descended on Tampa, so too have a contingent of workers from companies owned by Bain Capital, the private-equity firm co-founded by presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Calling themselves “Ambassadors of the 99 Percent,” the workers from Bain-affiliated companies around the country are speaking out about their poor working conditions and wages--and their belief that things would get worse for everyday people under a president with a Bain mentality. <PARAGRAPH> The workers convened at a rally Sunday in Tampa, joining a crowd of people protesting the convention. Nearby, Code Pink members dressed as vaginas to protest the Republican stand on abortion and contraception, dog-owners brought their canines to highlight Romney’s famous dog-on-the-roof road trip, and a man carried a six-foot silver spoon with Romney’s name on it. <PARAGRAPH> A major protest focusing specifically on Bain Capital is planned for August 30, during Romney’s nomination acceptance speech. Occupy Tampa promises that: “We will use this opportunity to protest and raise awareness about Bain Capital’s business practices. Hopefully this will pressure Bain Capital to behave ethically.”  Salon.com recently noted that Tampa itself is a perfect example of failed Republican social welfare and development policies, due in part to the work of financial firms like Bain.  <PARAGRAPH> For months, Obama backers and workers rights groups have highlighted Bain’s reputation for taking over and closing or outsourcing companies, and more recently for poor working conditions and pay at Bain-owned companies. <PARAGRAPH> Unions and workers rights groups have been held actions around the country at Dunkin’ Donuts and other well-known companies owned or co-owned by Bain and its subsidiaries. In addition to Dunkin', these include Clear Channel Communications, Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, Roy’s Hawaiian Fusion Cuisine, Burlington Coat Factory, Baskin Robbins, Gymboree, Hospital Corporation of America, Michael’s Craft Store, Toys’R’Us, Staples, The Princeton Review and Work ‘N Gear. <PARAGRAPH> On Saturday, workers from Bain-owned companies departed for the convention from JFK airport in New York. Organized with the group United NY, they included employees of Dunkin’ Donuts, Burlington Coat Factory and Air Serv Corporation. <PARAGRAPH> A group of Illinois workers is heading for Florida from Sensata Technologies, a Bain-owned sensor manufacturer based in Freeport, Ill. As David Moberg recently reported for In These Times, the 170 mostly female workers who will lose their jobs are being forced to train their visiting Chinese replacements as the factory is disassembled. <PARAGRAPH> Three Wisconsin workers left for Tampa from a send-off event at a Dunkin Donuts in Milwaukee. Sam Moore, a Dunkin Donuts worker and a young father of two from Pittsburgh, told local media that he earns $7.25 an hour, not enough to cover gas and basic costs. <PARAGRAPH> Bain and two other equity firms, The Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, purchased the company that owns Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins for $2.425 billion in 2005.  In a strange twist, it’s been reported that with the buyout Bain Capital “saved” the site of Michelle and Barack Obama’s first kiss, at a Baskin Robbins in Hyde Park in 1989.  <PARAGRAPH> in the case of Dunkin’ Donuts, prevailing wages were low even before the Bain takeover. While some Bain deals result in outsourcing jobs and squeezing workers, in other cases it’s unclear how to what extent Bain is responsible for specific working conditions and wages at its subsidiaries. Certainly workers also face exploitative conditions at non-Bain-owned corporations. <PARAGRAPH> But on a broader scale, the Bain-focused campaigns serve to highlight the conditions of labor in the United States as a whole. It's typical for hugely profitable corporations to pay poverty wages while relying on ethically questionable international supply chains. Bain is certainly no exception; quick Google searches turn up various complaints and charges of labor law violations, poor working conditions or disturbing supply chain issues for almost all the Bain-linked companies. <PARAGRAPH> For example, this year Toys ‘R’ Us was named one of the city’s worst employers by United NY, along with a chain of car washes, an airline service and the utility company Con Edison. The group said most Toys ‘R’ Us workers make less than $10 an hour–a paltry wage, especially in New York City–while the company’s CEO makes $8 million a year. “If you are making this amount of profit, the least that you can do is pay your workers a decent wage,  said United NY executive director Camilla Rivera. <PARAGRAPH> Other Bain subsidiaries have been targeted by activists, employees and the federal government over working conditions: <PARAGRAPH> Toys ‘R’ Us has also been fined by the federal government for dangerous conditions at a Brooklyn store. Workers at an Outback Steakhouse in Calumet City, Ill. filed a class action lawsuit in 2011 charging state and federal labor law violations including tips and wages withheld. Gymboree and Toys ‘R’ Us are among many national companies targeted by labor rights activists as buying products made overseas with child labor. Last fall Gymboree agreed to stop buying cotton sourced from Uzbekistan, where child field labor is common, though activists say the company still sources other products from areas known for child labor. Toys ‘R’ Us has in the past faced federal child labor violation charges at its US stores, involving restrictions on working hours for 14- and 15-year-olds. Earlier this year Gymboree was ordered to pay $430,000 to Massachusetts employees for denying meal breaks mandated under state labor law. Bain was also at the center of the controversial anti-Romney ad by a pro-Obama super PAC that insinuated Romney deserved blame for a woman’s death from cancer after her husband was laid off from a Bain-owned steel mill, leaving her without health insurance.  The Obama campaign said they had no role in the commercial and did not know the steel worker . <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile a post on the website AboutMyJob.com--a site for stories venting about degrading conditions, short shifts and annoying customers--sheds light on what it is like to work at Baskin Robbins: <PARAGRAPH>  You go through all this frustration, for two weeks, and then the paycheck comes. This, to most people is the day when it is all worth it, all the customers, the screaming kids, nope. Not to me. It is a huge let down knowing that in two years, and becoming manager, I only make 60 cents over minimum wage. Yes that’s right… only 60 cents. 10 cents at your one year mark people! How exciting right?? Nope… slap in the face. 
Chicago Teachers Move Toward Strike  Updated  | <PARAGRAPH> Update: On Wednesday, August 29, Chicago Teachers Union president Karen Lewis filed 10-day notice of a strike. <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO–There was palpable excitement in the air as teachers in red union T-shirts streamed into the formidable stone-and-brick structure that is Chicago's Lane Tech College Prep High School on the evening of Aug. 22. <PARAGRAPH> Inside, delegates from schools across the city would vote later that night to give union president Karen Lewis the authority to give the 10 days notice required for a strike. The majority of schools start the day after Labor Day, Sept. 4, so a first-day strike would require notice almost immediately. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> An advance battle has already begun at the district’s “Track E” institutions, which are back in session despite a sweltering heat wave and a lack of air conditioning in many classrooms. This week the union has been printing up strike posters in preparation and holding informational pickets at the Track E schools. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, district administrators distributed a memo to principals asking them to report union activity such as work slowdowns, “sick outs” and “other job actions that undermine supervisory authority and deleteriously affect the mission and goals of the Chicago public school system.” On Aug. 22 the Board of Education voted to authorize spending $25 million on “student safety” and student meals in case of a strike, with programming offered at non-school locations such as libraries and churches. <PARAGRAPH> The fight over a longer school day for Chicago students has largely been resolved. To lengthen the school day without requiring teachers to work longer hours, the district will rehire teachers who had previously been laid off. But contract negotiations are still not going well, according to the union, with the two sides at loggerheads over issues such as salary, class size and teacher evaluation by student performance. <PARAGRAPH> “This has been really hard, because none of us want to go out” on strike, says bargaining team member Susan Hickey, a clinician. <PARAGRAPH> Xian Barrett, who teaches law and Chicago history at Gage Park High School in a rough neighborhood on the city’s South Side, says, “From day-to-day working with kids, I hope there’s not a strike.” <PARAGRAPH> But he sees the struggle in a bigger context. “In terms of caring about these students’ long term futures, and the future of their kids and their kids’ kids, I think a strike is a necessary step in taking the schools back.” <PARAGRAPH> Like many teachers, Barrett sees the fight over contract issues as part of a larger battle over the whole shape of public education in Chicago, including whose voices are heard and whose interests are served. In Chicago, as in many cities, union teachers and many parents are speaking out against the growth of non-union charter schools, the evaluation of teachers based largely on student performance on standardized tests and the closing of “under-performing” neighborhood schools. Union leaders and progressive education experts say that the Chicago school system has become more corporate and top-down and less responsive to teacher and parent concerns ever since 1995, when the mayor’s office was given control of the system.  <PARAGRAPH> Barrett was a founding member of the progressive group CORE  Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators  that won leadership of the Chicago Teachers Union in a hotly contested 2010 election. Since then the union has pushed back hard against city plans to close schools and increase the number of charters. <PARAGRAPH> According to Barrett and many other teachers, tensions intensified after Emanuel took office in May 2011. <PARAGRAPH> “He is ridiculous,” said Jeanine Trize, who has worked as a teacher’s aide in the schools for 22 years. “How can you come into a system you know nothing about and without working with the teachers and students just start changing things? We don’t have money to put our kids in private school like he does. We should be the ones deciding what happens in the public schools, not him.” <PARAGRAPH> Barrett grew up around the labor movement. His mother was a National Education Association organizing director in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois and his father is a labor historian. He got his first taste of teaching in the JET program in Japan, where he taught English and human rights. He started at the Chicago public schools in 2006 and became quickly disillusioned with the union leadership. When other young progressive teachers invited him to participate in what would become the founding meeting of CORE--“just 10 people sitting around a small table, where we chose the name and everything --he was excited that “I had found a cool group of troublemakers who could help offer something new to students.” <PARAGRAPH> In 2009 he was chosen as a Classroom Teaching Ambassador Fellow by the U.S. Department of Education; in 2010 he was fired by the Chicago schools. He says the principal told him it was because his students were skipping class–of their own volition–to attend Board of Education meetings about planned school closings. So Barrett turned his energies to working for the union. <PARAGRAPH> Barrett was one of the last to believe that CORE taking leadership of the union was a possible or a legitimate goal. But as CORE members became increasingly vocal in union business, the group rapidly gained popularity and converts. Their victory in the 2010 union elections was seen as a sign that teachers were hungry for leadership more willing to stand up to the city administration and the Board of Education. Now, they are possibly on the cusp of the union’s first strike in a quarter century, with nearly 90 percent of union members voting in June to authorize one. <PARAGRAPH> “I was just in Europe–in Belgium and England–and people were talking about this, it’s international news,” said special education teacher Sarah Chambers outside the delegates meeting. “I was also in New York, and lots of teachers were talking about it. And in Puerto Rico. They say if we go on strike, they will be here to support us.” <PARAGRAPH> After about two hours, teachers started walking out of Lane Tech into the packed parking lot. They seemed energized and determined. When Lewis appeared toward the tail end of the crowd, teachers clustered around her and cheered. <PARAGRAPH> The delegates had voted to grant her the authority to give 10-day notice for a strike. Whether she will do so in coming days remains to be seen, depending how contract negotiations go. Teachers leaving the meeting refrained from talking about what happened inside or the vote, but they unanimously expressed the sentiment that they are being driven to extreme measures by an administration they believe is intentionally picking a fight with the union rather than trying to resolve challenges facing the schools through a democratic process. <PARAGRAPH> “I don’t think [Emanuel] has the city’s and citizens’ best interest in mind,” said Tom Brady, an elementary school English teacher on the city’s far South side, who has worked for 24 years in the public school system. “Ultimately [former Mayor Richard M.] Daley did not want labor unrest. Emanuel is more willing to have labor unrest… It’s not just teachers, it’s also the librarians, and then the police and firefighters’ contracts are up next.” <PARAGRAPH> Chambers said other unions in the public schools and citywide are watching the teachers' struggle as a bellwether of things to come. <PARAGRAPH> “If they take us down, they take everyone down,” she said. “There are 19 unions in the schools. Our contracts affect the working conditions and contracts for everyone else.” <PARAGRAPH> Other public-sector unions and community groups have rallied behind the teachers, and surveys have shown that parents strongly support the teachers’ position. <PARAGRAPH> Barrett said, “People call Rahm the best union organizer we ever had.”
Rahm Emanuel’s ‘Leaky Jobs Pipeline’ Exposed | <PARAGRAPH> During Rahm Emanuel’s first year-plus as Chicago mayor, his office has issued a steady stream of press releases about corporations moving to downtown. Emanuel’s office says 20,000 new jobs will be created by eight major companies shifting their headquarters there and 28 more companies significantly expanding downtown operations. <PARAGRAPH> But on August 19 the Chicago Tribune deflated many of Emanuel’s jobs claims with the front-page story “Mayor Emanuel’s Jobs Pipeline Somewhat Leaky.” <PARAGRAPH> As the Tribune reported, in several prominent cases the shift of jobs from the suburbs to downtown Chicago actually meant serious net job cuts for the region. The paper explains: <PARAGRAPH> While about 60 percent of [Emanuel’s] job pledges are for new positions, the remainder likely will be transfers—good for the city but not providing direct opportunities for the 1 in 10 Chicagoans who are out of work and looking for jobs in a soggy economy. Moreover, of the new jobs, more than 1,700 of the positions the mayor counts are construction jobs, which aren't permanent. Of all the announced jobs, 2,200 are with companies that failed to provide a definitive date on when they would finish the hiring, and about 3,600 are on phased timetables that could stretch beyond 2015, raising the question of how firm those pledges could be. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> The Tribune, In These Times and other outlets have reported the details of some of these  leaky  transfers: <PARAGRAPH> In 2011 Emanuel used between $5 and $6.5 million in TIF money to convince Sara Lee Corporation to bring the headquarters of its North American Meats company back to downtown Chicago after six years in the suburbs. But with the move, the company cut almost half of the meat division's staff–from a total of about 1,000 at its suburban headquarters to between 500 and 650 at the new downtown location. In July 2012 Google Inc. announced it would move its Motorola Mobility division with 3,000 employees to Chicago from suburban Libertyville. Then in August, Motorola Mobility reported it was slashing its international payroll by 20 percent, including eliminating about 650 to 700 jobs that had been expected to move from Libertyville to Chicago. Libertyville workers said they were confused and stunned by the mixed messages, especially since just a year earlier Illinois governor Pat Quinn had offered the company $100 million in tax incentives to stay in Libertyville. The Tribune also featured the case of Lawson Products, which in late 2011 promised to relocate its headquarters from suburban Des Plaines to Chicago. Emanuel called it  a significant commitment to the city,” but the Tribune noted that “the move amounted to shifting the company from one side of the Tri-State Tollway to the other.” Lawson, which makes hose fittings, hydraulics and other industrial supplies, transferred about 400 employees to the new Chicago headquarters in spring 2012. But a few months later, it laid off about 100 employees, including many at the Chicago headquarters. Nationwide, media and industry report that companies are opting to locate their headquarters downtown instead of in suburbs because of the growing popularity–especially for young professionals–of living in previously industrial or downtrodden “inner cities” now blooming with rehabbed lofts and new galleries and sidewalk cafes. <PARAGRAPH> Perhaps this was part of the logic–along with about $31 million in tax increment financing  TIF  dollars from Chicago taxpayers–when United Airlines decided to move its corporate headquarters from the suburbs to Chicago’s Willis Tower  formerly Sears Tower . <PARAGRAPH> But when companies like United Airlines move huge operations including many long-time employees from the suburbs to downtown, many of those employees will continue to live in the suburbs. And they likely will usually commute straight home after work, without patronizing Chicago stores or restaurants where they theoretically would stimulate more job creation. Even when these commuters do hang around after work and spend money in Chicago, in such an upscale area they will likely be spending money at high-end and chain establishments that do little to augment the fortunes of regular Chicago workers or mom-and-pop store owners.
Not-For-Profit Hospitals Make Billions—and Provide Little Charity Care | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Not-for-profit hospitals, including some of the country’s biggest and best-known institutions, are almost entirely tax exempt, in part because of the expectation they will provide free or low-cost “charity care  to those in need. But a report released this week by a research arm of California Nurses Association   National Nurses United found that California not-for-profit hospitals are reaping huge tax benefits while providing minimal charity care. <PARAGRAPH> Many people don’t realize that not-for-profit institutions can accumulate profits. They can; the profit cannot be disbursed to individual owners or stockholders but rather is supposed to be reinvested for the good of the community. With hospitals, that is generally assumed to include the provision of charity care to uninsured or low-income people. But while 11 states, including Texas and Alabama, mandate specific levels of charity care, California and the federal government do not. <PARAGRAPH> As a result, not-for-profit tax breaks for well-known California hospitals–including Cedars Sinai, Kaiser Permanente and Stanford University--dwarf the level of charity care provided. Overall, the 196 hospitals surveyed received $3.3 billion in 2010 state and federal tax exemptions and spent only $1.4 billion on charity care--a gap of $1.8 billion. Three-quarters of the hospitals got more dollars in tax breaks than they spent on charity care. Half spent less than 2.46 percent of their operating expenses on charity care. <PARAGRAPH> The tax breaks hurt financially strapped counties and towns; according to the report, California counties and municipalities lost about $1 billion in tax revenue they would have otherwise collected in 2010. Public budgets suffer when large institutions don’t pay taxes, and budget crunches are often taken out on public workers, as well as those who rely on the services they provide. Counties or cities also end up essentially picking up the tab for health care when impoverished patients can’t pay and hospitals either deny care–diverting the patients elsewhere–or insist on billing. The report notes that California counties and towns paid $450 million in 2010 to for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals for care for people who could not pay their medical bills. <PARAGRAPH> All of these spillover effects concern National Nurses United, whose mission includes patient advocacy and  accessible, quality healthcare for all.  Spokesperson Chuck Idelson told In These Times, “Nurses see what happens to their patients and their communities when these giant corporate hospitals behave more like Lehman Brothers or JP Morgan than a community service. For example, Sutter Health has engaged in widespread slashing of mental health services, women’s services, children’s services–cuts that will make them profits.  <PARAGRAPH> The nurses' union proposes California legislation that would force not-for-profit hospitals to beef up their charity care if they want to maintain their tax exemptions. It wants hospitals to spend at least 8 percent of revenues on charity care, echoing a proposal made by the state attorney general in 2006. The nurses are also demanding more transparency in how hospitals report and define their charity care, to exclude the  promotional activities or cost containment  interpreted by many hospitals as cutting services   that are currently counted. Violations of charity care obligations could be punished by fines and or the revoking of tax exempt status. <PARAGRAPH> To those who wish to support NNU's efforts, Idelson says,  You can contact your legislator to insist they pass legislation, and tell the non-profit hospitals to cease their practices of putting profits and executive pay over charity care.  <PARAGRAPH> While California relies more heavily than most states on not-for-profit hospitals, which take in 70 percent of California patients, the nurses union says that similar situations exist nationwide. In 2004 I wrote for the Chicago Reader about the religious, not-for-profit chain Advocate denying charity care to people in need–billing them for their care, and then suing them and garnishing their wages when they couldn’t pay bills that were actually larger than insured people would have been given for the same service. <PARAGRAPH> Earlier this month scores of union nurses, in their trademark red garb, attended the release of a report by the state auditor on charity care. At the hearing, State Board of Equalization member Betty Yee noted that not-for-profit hospitals actually often provide less charity care than for-profit institutions. <PARAGRAPH> Many for-profit hospitals have taken a hit during the economic crisis, in part because of rising numbers of uninsured and desperate patients whom they are legally obligated to treat.  One exception, as The New York Times reported this week, is the HCA chain owned by Bain Capital, which has made huge profits largely through cutting services and staffing.  <PARAGRAPH> Idelson stressed that the debate shouldn’t be about the merits of for-profit versus not-for-profit health care systems, but rather public versus private ones. “If you look at the level of charity care and other community benefits and pricing practices, the difference between private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals is very small,  she says.  But the difference between private and public systems is massive. The institutions that are really acting in a way people think hospitals should behave are the hard-pressed county and public hospital systems.” <PARAGRAPH> Idelson noted that while the union’s recommendations are necessary for the immediate future, the overall crisis just underscores the need for revamping the country’s entire private, profit-based health care system. <PARAGRAPH> “No one should have to worry about getting access to medical care. You should not see services arbitrarily cut because they are not profitable services. In the long term the only solution is transforming our healthcare system into the type most countries have–which is a national single-payer system.”
Chicago: Occupiers of Mental Health Clinics Face Trial | <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO--On Tuesday, N’Dana Carter and others arrested for occupying the now-shuttered public mental health clinic in Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood headed to court on charges of criminal trespassing. The bench trial was postponed until October. Meanwhile, Carter’s rage at clinic closings--and what they say about the city’s priorities--continues to grow. <PARAGRAPH> Six of the city’s 12 public mental health clinics were closed this year and scores of union staff laid off, including disproportionately high numbers of Black and Latino workers. <PARAGRAPH> Carter and others say the impacts on low-income, minority South and West Side neighborhoods have been severe. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> “The city of Chicago made a hit on the African American community when they decided to fire every African-American male therapist,  Carter tells In These Times.  Who is the first to be arrested in the city of Chicago? African-American males. And upon release from prison, there’s often a requirement to seek mental health therapy. Therapy is successful because you develop a healthy relationship with your therapist. These are people who have been displaced, disrespected, locked up for some years; do you really think they’ll be able to relate to white women, white men?” <PARAGRAPH> As part of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s inaugural 2012 budget, the clinics were closed to save a reported $3 million. Just before Christmas last year, The Chicago Reporter revealed the details: planned layoffs of 208 workers in the city Department of Public Health, due to both the menta-health clinic closures and the privatization of public primary care health clinics. <PARAGRAPH> Carter told In These Times,  Some of the people laid off had been on the job 20 or 25 years. They had substantial relationships with their patients. People could call their therapists at any hour. Therapists that would buy food out of their own pocket for their clients. It wasn’t a casual relationship, they were loving intense relationships. Now [many of the patients] won’t even come outside, they won’t talk, it’s painful to see. We’re looking at people who are literally falling apart while the city is saying, ‘That’s your problem–you shouldn’t be sick, you shouldn’t be mentally ill.’” <PARAGRAPH>  Read AFSCME’s reports on the impact of the closures here.  <PARAGRAPH> The clinic cuts are among the most high-profile public service cuts and privatizations being undertaken by the Emanuel administration in order to address the city’s gaping budget hole. But grassroots groups point out that while cutting public services, the city continues its tradition of doling out millions in taxpayer dollars to wealthy corporations under the tax increment financing  TIF  program. <PARAGRAPH> TIFs are meant to stimulate “blighted” neighborhoods by setting aside a portion of property tax dollars to subsidize local business growth. But for years, critics have charged the federal program is grossly misused in Chicago, with subsidies going to major corporations in already-thriving and upscale areas that could hardly qualify as “blighted.” Last week In These Times reported on Chicago union members protesting TIF dollars given to United Airlines and Coors Miller Lite in the downtown “LaSalle Central” district. <PARAGRAPH> The city is also spending a total of $20 million in TIF dollars for commercial redevelopment around the University of Chicago, not far from the now-shuttered Woodlawn mental health clinic that members of the Mental Health Movement occupied in April. Clinic patients and their supporters can’t help but notice that just a fraction of this TIF subsidy could theoretically keep all six mental health clinics open. Meanwhile, residents of the adjacent low-income, largely African American neighborhoods such as Woodlawn say that they are being pushed out by the university’s development policies. <PARAGRAPH> It is unclear whether TIF money could legally be diverted to public services like clinics. But critics suggest simply cancelling inappropriate TIFs so the property tax dollars can be used as usual for public resources.
Huckabee to pundits: Put up or shut up | Mike Huckabee on Thursday laid out a challenge to the pundits who are now criticizing Mitt Romney’s campaign: “If you’re so doggone good at this, when will we see your name on the ballot?”  <paragraph> “I’m just so tired of the people who have never actually gotten in the game of politics trying to figure out what went wrong,” he said on “The Mike Huckabee Show” Thursday afternoon. “And I’m going to challenge, if you're one of those people — you may even be a host of a radio show — if you're so doggone good at this, when will we see your name on the ballot? I’m just curious if you’ll let me know, because I want to sit back and watch to see how it ought to be done.”  <paragraph>  For those that have never been in the political arena to think they understand how to run a campaign, Huckabee said, just shows the “level of ignorance” among political pundits. <paragraph> “So I say come out of the stands, put your jacket aside where it’s nice and warm, get down on the field, take a few hits upside the head, come off the field with your own blood pouring out of your body, several of your bones broken, and tell me what a great, great genius approach you had to the whole process,” Huckabee said. <paragraph> The former Arkansas governor also reflected on his own political career, noting that each time someone offered him advice on how to win, he felt tempted to respond sarcastically. <paragraph> “No, I really don’t want to win, because then you have to work and you have a job to do,” Huckabee said he would want to tell his critics. “I just want to run to run because it’s so much fun coming out here, getting up at four in the morning every morning and running until well past midnight, living off hot cokes and cold pizza, eating every meal you have for two years out of a paper sack while on the way to yet another campaign event. So, no, I really don’t want to win the election, I just enjoy this extraordinary process of having the tar beaten out of me by newspapers, editorial cartoonists, by opponents and their negative ads.” <paragraph> 
Sean Hannity on Wednesday said Americans deserve the government they voted for and  America now deserves Barack Obama” — “good luck with that.” <paragraph>  “Americans, you get the government you deserve,” he told listeners to his radio show on Wednesday. “And it pains me to say this, but America now deserves Barack Obama. You deserve what you voted for. I know half the country didn’t vote that way, but America deserves the government that they want and they deserve. Four years ago, the public could be excused for voting for Obama because, frankly, he was a blank canvas.” <paragraph> “Now he is a known entity,” the conservative radio host said. “And just barely over 50 percent looked at his pathetic record and decided they wanted more of the same. I’m not sure exactly why they arrived at that judgment, I think it’s a bad judgment, but we are a self-governing country and the voice and the will of ‘We the People’ have now been heard. America wanted Barack Obama four more years. Now you’ve got him.” <paragraph> “Good luck with that,” he added. <paragraph> Hannity also called on fellow conservatives to not “give up the fight.” <paragraph> “You don’t give up in the cause you believe in,” he said. “You can’t call yourself a conservative. The country that we love — you know, what happens to the world if American doesn’t, doesn’t lead? You can take a few days if you want to feel sorry for yourself, not that it’s going to do any good. Yeah, we did take a big body blow and we all know it. We’re all stunned. It’s like you got punched in the head, and it’s like, ow, whoa, hello.” <paragraph> 
Foreign media eyes U.S. results | President Barack Obama’s victory over Mitt Romney took center stage at media organizations around the world on Wednesday as they assessed what Obama’s reelection spells for their own countries over the next four years.  <paragraph> In Israel, the left-leaning paper Haaretz wrote about Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s “election-night double whammy.” <paragraph> “He suffered a caustic and humiliating political double loss,” Haaretz’s Yossi Verter wrote. “It began with Naftali Bennett’s election as the new chairman of the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi party and ended with President Barack Obama’s reelection and the defeat of Netanyahu’s old friend Mitt Romney in the race for the White House.” <paragraph> And that means that Netanyahu “will pay the price” with his relationship with Obama. <paragraph> “The chilly and murky relationship between the current and next president and the current prime minister – who is also very likely to be the next prime minister – is well-known,” Verter wrote. “Netanyahu gambled on Romney. Netanyahu’s bet did not come in. Netanyahu will pay the price. How high will the cost be? How painful will it be? Obama will decide, at the time and place of his choosing. If he decides to meddle in our election campaign in some fashion, no one could blame him. Bibi started it.” <paragraph> And The Jerusalem Post put together a round-up of Israeli politicians’ responses to Obama’s victory, noting that Netanyahu “hosted US Ambassador Dan Shapiro at his Jerusalem office Wednesday to personally assure him that he wanted to work closely with US President Barack Obama.” Meanwhile, the Post wrote, “defense minister Ehud Barak issued his congratulatory statement even before Obama’s acceptance speech. According to Channel 2 reporter Udi Segal, he was the first to do so.” And President Shimon Peres wrote Obama a letter saying, “your success will be the success of us all.” <paragraph>  Kenya’s state-run media organization — Kenya Broadcasting Corporation — reported on the celebration in Kogelo, the hometown of Obama’s father. Family spokesperson Malick Abongo told journalists that “we did not want to celebrate or have any prior arrangement for that because the race was too tight, but now we can throw a party.” The village is planning to throw a feast to celebrate, KBC added. <paragraph> Reuters interviewed Romney’s Mormon relatives in Mexico, who the wire service wrote “mourned his presidential election defeat.” <paragraph> Just to let him slip away from being president of the United States is a real tragedy for the U.S. because he could have given the country so much,” Virginia Romney told Reuters. “He has been such a success in everything he has done.” <paragraph> China’s state news agency Xinhua reflected on the future of U.S.-Chinese relations in a commentary piece that never mentioned Obama. <paragraph> “China seeks to develop and engage with the international community in a peaceful way. It wants to build a new type of relationship — one defined by mutual benefit and cooperation — with major countries,” Xinhua wrote. “Whereas, there remains the antiquated attitude in which an emerging player is considered as a threat to established ones and should be suppressed. This mindset has led to much unrest and even world wars in the past, but has yet to be abandoned.”
MSNBC weighs in on Karl Rove | <video>  MSNBC has weighed in on Karl Rove’s spat with Fox News co-hosts <hyperlink> over the network's decision to call Ohio for President Obama. <paragraph> MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow said Rove “is describing this as being just like 2000 and it is not over.” <paragraph> “I don’t mean to cross-advertise here, but on the conservative cable news network Fox News Channel – Fox News Channel called Ohio for Obama, but the on-air talent at Fox News Channel is refusing to concede that they believe it,  she said. <paragraph> “Can you define that word ‘talent’ for the people who are not in this industry,” MSNBC's Chris Matthews jumped in. “They happen to have positions. It doesn’t say anything about their quality.” <paragraph> “People who are wearing makeup and have cameras pointed at them,” Maddow replied.  It's not everybody who's on Fox News tonight, but some of the people who Fox is putting on tonight are refusing to believe their own network’s call in the state of Ohio.  <paragraph> Maddow added that Rove “is now trying to get on air the Fox News Channel to rescind its call in Ohio in favor of the candidate that he has bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. This is a remarkable thing.” <paragraph> NBC’s Chuck Todd called Rove’s reaction part of what will likely be seen from many Republicans — “it’s more than just a feeling of grief that they lost, they don’t believe it,” he said. <paragraph> “This goes to the larger point that I’ve been trying to make that there is going to be a big chunk of one of the two sides that was not going to believe they lost – it’s more than just a feeling of grief that they lost, they don’t believe it,” Todd said on MSNBC. “And I think you’re going to have a large chunk of the Republican base that doesn’t understand it. They’ve been told that the polls were skewed for week. They’ve been told for weeks there was something wrong with the polling and there was something wrong here and so that just makes it more difficult to govern. Let’s not pretend that it doesn’t.” <paragraph> Maddow also said Rove’s challenge is indicative of something that is happening on the right: “questioning what used to be basic agreed upon data.” <paragraph> “It’s worth looking at close races and I do not begrudge the Romney campaign for saying that they’ve got issues with what’s gone on with Ohio,” Maddow said. “But to decide that a result isn’t a result as long as you don’t like the outcome is something that means that we cannot work together as a country anymore. And we can’t go down this road very much further.” <paragraph> 
Karl Rove: Fox News Ohio call 'premature' | <video> Fox News has called Ohio for President Barack Obama, but Karl Rove disagreed with that decision Tuesday night, saying the state is far from settled and the call was “premature.” <paragraph>  Fox News’s Chris Wallace said the Romney campaign does  not believe Ohio is in the Obama camp,” noting that he got an email from a top Romney aide who said the campaign disagrees with the network’s call. He then asked Rove if he believed Ohio has been settled. <paragraph>  “No, I don’t,” Rove said. <paragraph>  “I think this is premature,” he added. “We’ve got a quarter of the vote. Now remember, here is the thing about Ohio. A third of the vote or more is cast early and is won overwhelmingly by the Democrats. It’s counted first and then you count the election day and the question is, by the time you finish counting the election day does it overcome that early advantage that Democrats have built up in early voting, particularly in Cuyahoga County.” <paragraph> Rove said the network needs to be “careful about calling things when we have like 991 votes separating the two candidates and a quarter of the vote yet to count. Even if they have made it on the basis of select precincts, I’d be very cautious about intruding in this process.” <paragraph> Wallace then replied, “Well, folks. So, maybe not so fast.” <paragraph> Fox News’s Megyn Kelly also weighed in, saying, “that’s awkward.” <paragraph> Shortly after, Kelly headed over to the “decision desk” to interview the team that made the call for Fox News. <paragraph> “We were thinking this wouldn’t be necessary, but as it turns out,” Kelly said, trailing off as she made the long walk through the studio. <paragraph> Fox News's decision desk said it stood by the call. <paragraph> “We are actually quite comfortable with the call in Ohio,” the pollster told Kelly. “Basically, right now there is too much Obama vote that's outstanding there that we know is going to come in, that is going to be Obama and while, yes, there are a number of counties out there that will be Romney, the largest thing that's outstanding right now is the Cleveland area, is Cuyahoga. This is Democratic territory and we're quite comfortable with the idea that Obama will carry Ohio.” <paragraph> As of publication, Rove is still disputing the call. 
Al Gore: Voter suppression like 'racist Jim Crow tactics' | Al Gore said Tuesday on Current TV that the attempt this cycle to stop people from voting has been  un-American  and a  disgrace,  adding that it is a “strategy that is a direct descendent  of  racist Jim Crow tactics.” <paragraph> Gore, who co-founded the left-leaning cable channel, said he hopes there will be a  reckoning for these governors and state legistures that have intentionally tried to prevent people from voting. It is un-American.  The problem — which he said included the long lines facing many voters, particularly in Florida — must be addressed in a bipartisan way after the election. <paragraph> “It is a strategy that is a direct descendent of the racist Jim Crow tactics that were used in the wake of the Civil War to prevent black people from voting. It’s more sophisticated now, it’s dressed up in different kinds of language, but it is un-American,” he said. “It is wrong. It is a disgrace to this country. And there ought to be a bipartisan movement to say, enough of this. We have the ability to let everyone who is eligible to vote without standing in line for eight hours, without having their names stricken wrongly from the voting rolls. And this is something that ought to be a bipartisan agenda after this election.” 
Bill O'Reilly: 'The white establishment is now the minority' | <video>  Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly said tonight that if President Barack Obama wins re-election, it’s because the demographics of the country have changed and “it’s not a traditional America anymore.” <paragraph> “The white establishment is now the minority,” O'Reilly said. “And the voters, many of them, feel that the economic system is stacked against them and they want stuff. You are going to see a tremendous Hispanic vote for President Obama. Overwhelming black vote for President Obama. And women will probably break President Obama's way. People feel that they are entitled to things and which candidate, between the two, is going to give them things?” <paragraph> “The demographics are changing,” he said. “It’s not a traditional America anymore.” <paragraph>  See also: 2012 election results map   <hyperlink> <paragraph> O’Reilly said 50 percent of the voting public are people who “want stuff. They want things. And who is going to give them things? President Obama. He knows it, and he ran on it.” <paragraph> Twenty years ago, an establishment candidate like Mitt Romney would have trounced Obama, O’Reilly said. <paragraph> O’Reilly also criticized Romney for his response to Hurricane Sandy and said his campaign took “no chances” in recent days. <paragraph> “[Hurricane Sandy] just wiped the governor’s campaign off the map for five days. Five days Mitt Romney disappeared from the national debate and from the media headline,” O’Reilly said. “Now, it's interesting, because I told their campaign, and this is not self-aggrandizement, but I was speaking to some of the Romney people and I said do you have any idea that you are now invisible? Alright, no one is paying attention to you.” <paragraph>  PHOTOS: Election Day 2012   <hyperlink> <paragraph> Obama, on the other hand, was seen out there trying to help victims, O’Reilly said. <paragraph> “I don't think that registered on the Romney people. But, in the exit polls tonight, that is a factor that President Obama looked bipartisan and presidential during that storm,” he said. <paragraph> And the Romney campaign coasted far too much on his debate performances in these last days, he added. <paragraph> “The strategy was we did better than we thought we were going to do in the debates. We're going to roll that into election day and take no chances,” O’Reilly said. “And that's exactly what the Romney campaign did. They took no chances. They didn't go on talk radio. They didn't go on national programs outside of football game interviews which mean nothing. They thought that they did well enough in the debates to roll in. And, you know what? They were right, except for Hurricane Sandy.”
Brit Hume: Obama 'made a real race of it' | Fox News’s Brit Hume said tonight that in spite of the economy,  Obamacare  and difficulties abroad, President Barack Obama has “made a real race of it” thanks to his team and the image many voters have of him as a “hero and historic figure.”  <paragraph>  With all those issues on the table this cycle,  one might have thought that the fundamental to this election would have given any reasonable challenger a leg up,  Hume said. <paragraph> “I will say this — given the conditions in the country, given the fact that we do not have a robust recovery four years after Barack Obama was inaugurated, or elected, and given the fact that, you know, we have had difficulties on the world scene most recently with the problems in Libya, given the fact that  Obamacare,  the president's proudest achievement in his own way of looking at things, remains unpopular, one might have thought that the fundamental to this election would have given any reasonable challenger a leg up,” Hume said. <paragraph> But that discounts two major factors, Hume said: Obama’s ground game and his position in the minds of many Americans. <paragraph> “The feeling that people have about Barack Obama that he is a hero and a historic figure and, I think that people — we're finding that people really don't want to let go of that, a great many people,” Hume said. “We're also finding that the Obama team, anticipating certainly in the wake of 2010 but even before that, perhaps, that this was going to be a very difficult election, have built a real machine to try to get out their vote and try to make this a close race.” <paragraph> Hume added that “based on all that we knew coming into tonight, I’m not surprised it's close.” <paragraph> “If you looked back a couple years, you might have looked ahead and thought it would be easier election for the challenger than it so far has proved to be,” he said. “It doesn't mean, by the way, that the president is going to win. It just means that he’s made a real race of it.” 
Finding fault, world media watches | From Asia to the Middle East to Europe, media organizations worldwide are anxiously awaiting the results of the U.S. presidential election, parsing what either a second term for President Barack Obama or a win by Mitt Romney would mean for their own countries.  <paragraph> China’s state news agency Xinhua wrote in its column “China Voice” that the election means there will “hopefully” be a “pause in the China-bashing game.” During the campaign, “pointing fingers at China became an easy and convenient way for the two candidates to score political gains while avoiding taking responsibility for mishandling the domestic economy.” <paragraph> “If scapegoating and vilifying China are merely campaign tricks, with the heated campaign drawing to an end, it is time for whoever the president-in-waiting is to tone down his tough rhetoric and adopt a more rational stance,” the Nov. 6 column stated. “Despite arguments, there is common sense between the United States and China. As the world’s largest and second-largest economies, they can not afford to grapple with the backlash of any severe confrontations in any arena.” <paragraph> The column calls for the U.S. to find opportunities to partner with China and keep open a “constructive dialogue.” <paragraph> “It is better for the next U.S. president, [whoever] he may turn out to be, to seize the historic chance to extend the partnership,” the column stated. <paragraph> In Israel, left-leaning Haaretz newspaper’s senior correspondent Amir Oren focused on the impact of a potential Obama win on upcoming Israeli elections. <paragraph> “This is Obama’s second chance, after four years of missed opportunities, to clarify which direction he wants to go on the Middle East, so that Israeli voters will know if they are voting for a prime minister who will be on track to clash with Obama from the get-go,” Oren wrote. <paragraph> “In addition to making intensive efforts to reach an Israeli-Palestinian accord, Obama can be expected to give Iran a clear choice: talks or combat aircraft. He won’t waste his second chance,” Oren added.

He also has an infectious enthusiasm for good stories, and is one of the most collaborative newsroom leaders I've worked with.”
