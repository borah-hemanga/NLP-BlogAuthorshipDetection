A GOP wipeout in New England |  <paragraph>  The New England wing of the House GOP, after showing brief signs of life, is extinct again.  <paragraph>  Democrats cleaned out the region on Tuesday, knocking off New Hampshire GOP Reps Charlie Bass and Frank Giunta and fending off stiff challenges to Massachusetts Rep. John Tierney and Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline. Republicans also lost a toss-up open seat race in Connecticut.  <paragraph>  The GOP didn’t fare much better in New England’s Senate races either. Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown lost his seat, Independent Angus King captured retiring Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe’s seat, and Linda McMahon spent more than $40 million in a losing bid for Connecticut’s open Senate seat. In Vermont, meanwhile, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders demolished his GOP foe in a 71-25 landslide while Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse won 65-35.  <paragraph>     <hyperlink>  Also on POLITICO: Republicans keep control of House   <paragraph>  New England was without Republican representation in the House for two years after the 2008 defeat of Connecticut Rep. Chris Shays but the election of Bass and Giunta in 2010, along with GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, suggested the GOP still had a pulse.
An Illinois bloodbath |   <paragraph>  After picking up four House seats in 2010, Illinois Republicans gave most of them back Tuesday as Democrats knocked off four GOP incumbents.  <paragraph>  Veteran Rep. Judy Biggert and freshmen Reps. Joe Walsh, Bobby Schilling and Bob Dold fell short in their re-election bids, victims of   <hyperlink>  new congressional lines that made it tougher to hold their seats. Between that and home state President Barack Obama's top-of-the-ticket presence -- he won 57 percent of the statewide vote -- it was too much to overcome.  <paragraph>  The battle for the state's two competitive open seats was a wash, with each party holding the one they controlled.  <paragraph>  National Republicans had long been concerned about their Illinois exposure and the result ends up being something close to a worst case scenario.
25 key counties to watch tonight |   <paragraph>  <picture> AP Photo  <paragraph>  Forget about a national election. Forget about the swing states.  <paragraph>  The presidential election will be won and lost in a relatively narrow band of key counties within the swing states – some competitive, some partisan strongholds. That’s why Jefferson County, Colo.,  pop. 540,000  matters more than the most populous county in the nation, Los Angeles County, Calif.  pop. 9.9 million . And why two Wisconsin counties — Dane  pop. 496,000  and Waukesha  pop. 391,000  — are more relevant to the presidential outcome this year than the behemoth to their south, Illinois' Cook County  pop. 5.2 million .  <paragraph>     <hyperlink>  Also on POLITICO: Latest polls from across the U.S.   <paragraph>  Here’s a list of 25 of the most important counties tonight across the swing state map.  Colorado  <paragraph>  Jefferson County Republicans have a registration advantage over Democrats in this Denver suburb, but there are almost as many unaffiliated voters as Republicans. It’s a reflection of a swing county that was once a GOP stronghold but in recent years has drifted leftward. While Jefferson went for George W. Bush in 2004, since then a stream of Democratic statewide candidates have carried the county, including Barack Obama, who won by 9 points there.  <paragraph>  Arapahoe County Another suburban Denver locale, Arapahoe often moves in tandem with Jefferson County — both were once solidly Republican, moved toward the center, voted narrowly for George W. Bush in 2004 and then gave Barack Obama even bigger margins in 2008.  <paragraph>  El Paso County Home to Colorado Springs, with its politically engaged evangelical community and heavy military influence, El Paso County is a conservative stronghold where Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 2-to-1. Romney will need to turn in a big number out of El Paso — now the state’s most populous county — to capture Colorado, and must outperform John McCain, who ran well below the county’s typical landslide GOP presidential margins.  Florida  <paragraph>  Duval County A reliable GOP performer over the years, Jacksonville’s Duval County nearly went for Obama in 2008 — in large part due to high African-American turnout. Republicans need a Romney result in the mid-to-high 50s to help balance out Democratic votes elsewhere in the state.  <paragraph>  Hillsborough County Tampa’s Hillsborough County is one of the nation’s top bellwethers: Since 1960, no presidential candidate has won Florida without carrying it.  <paragraph>  That’s why few places have gotten as much care and attention as Hillsborough this year. Not only have the candidates made several appearances, the GOP held its national convention in Tampa this summer. In 2008, both the McCain and Obama campaigns paid close attention to the county, but Obama won by 53 percent to 46 percent — the exact same margin that Bush won by in 2004.  <paragraph>  Miami-Dade County Obama needs to roll up the score in South Florida but particularly in Democratic Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county. Romney’s performance with Hispanic voters will be important in heavily Cuban-American Miami-Dade, where there are more than a quarter-million Hispanic Republicans.  <paragraph>  Orange County At the other end of the I-4 corridor from Tampa, Romney must improve on McCain’s dismal performance in Orlando’s Orange County, which wasn’t even close in 2008 after being decided by razor-thin margins in 2000 and 2004. But the growth of the non-Cuban Hispanic population in Orange County and neighboring Osceola County — most notably, the Democratic-voting Puerto Rican population — has altered the political equation over the past decade.  <paragraph>  South Florida — namely populous Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties — turned in big margins for Obama in 2008, which makes the I-4 corridor between Tampa and Orlando all the more important.  Iowa  <paragraph>  Dallas County A suburb of Des Moines, Dallas County is Iowa’s fastest-growing county. If Romney’s not winning in a place McCain won in 2008, he’s not going to win Iowa.  <paragraph>  Dubuque County Northeastern Iowa is the most heavily Roman Catholic part of the state. Obama won Democratic Dubuque County 60-39 in 2008, but Republicans expect Romney and running mate Paul Ryan to cut into Obama’s margins among Catholics as a result of tensions surrounding the federal mandate to cover contraceptive services in health plans.  <paragraph>  Johnson County A Democratic stronghold that’s home to Iowa City and the University of Iowa, the Obama campaign needs a big turnout in Johnson County to win roughly two-thirds of the vote.  <paragraph>  Polk County Polk County  Des Moines  is Iowa’s most populous by a wide margin; Democrats have a 39-31 percent registration advantage. Romney doesn’t have to win the county, but keeping Obama to the low 50s is imperative.  Nevada  <paragraph>  Clark County Democratic Clark County  Las Vegas , the state’s population hub, is where two-thirds of the Nevada vote was cast in 2008. There’s a significant Mormon population there, which should boost Romney, but the key for Republicans is holding down Obama’s victory margin.  <paragraph>  Washoe County The second-most populous county in the state and home to Reno, once-reliably Republican Washoe voted narrowly for Bush in 2004. Four years later, however, Obama carried it by 12 points. For Romney to win the state, he must win Washoe and Nevada’s rural counties to overcome Obama’s expected Clark County advantage.  New Hampshire  <paragraph>  Hillsborough County  If Mitt Romney is going to carry New Hampshire, he’s going to need Hillsborough, where more than a quarter of the state vote was cast in 2008. Its biggest cities are familiar datelines in presidential election years — Manchester and Nashua. This was a Bush county in 2000 and 2004 — narrowly — but Obama pulled out a 4-point win here in 2008. North Carolina  <paragraph>  Mecklenberg County Democrats held their national convention in Charlotte for a reason — this county, which has more voters than any other in the state, is critical to victory. In 2008, powered by strong African-American turnout, Obama crushed McCain in Mecklenberg by a stunning 62-37 margin — a full 10 percentage points above John Kerry’s 2004 performance.   <paragraph>  Wake County Though Bush carried it twice, Obama blew out the doors in 2008 in Democratic-trending Wake County: He won 57 percent among the affluent and educated Research Triangle electorate. It’s the state's second-most populous county after Charlotte's Mecklenburg County, so Romney must take a bit out of Obama’s 2008 margin to be competitive. Ohio  <paragraph>  Cuyahoga County If you could know the results of just one Ohio county on election night, Cuyahoga would be your choice. Home to Cleveland, the county is a Democratic stronghold where heavy turnout is essential to Democratic statewide hopes. Four years ago, Obama obliterated McCain there, 69-30, an impressive result even by the county’s standards.  <paragraph>  Franklin County Increasingly Democratic, Columbus’s Franklin County is Ohio’s second-largest population hub after Cuyahoga County. It voted narrowly for Al Gore  49-48 , comfortably for Kerry  54-45  and then strongly for Obama  60-39 .  <paragraph>  Hamilton County An explosion in African-American turnout in 2008 helped deliver Cincinnati’s Hamilton County to Obama, making him the first Democratic presidential nominee since LBJ to carry the population hub of southwest Ohio.  <paragraph>  Romney needs to win here to offset Democratic margins coming out of Cuyahoga County, a goal that’s within reach since both GOP Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rob Portman, a Cincinnati native and a key Romney surrogate, carried the county in 2010. Virginia  <paragraph>  Henrico County Like many other suburbs of the Eastern Seaboard, Henrico County is a one-time GOP stronghold that evolved over the years into a battleground.  <paragraph>  Over the past 12 years, it voted for George W. Bush twice, for former GOP Sen. George Allen in his unsuccessful 2006 reelection bid and for Republican Bob McDonnell for governor in 2009. But Henrico also voted for Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine for governor and for Barack Obama in 2008.  <paragraph>  African-American turnout here and in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News area is essential for an Obama victory.  <paragraph>  Prince William County Once reliably and strongly Republican, fast-growing, exurban Prince William County in Northern Virginia has become more competitive over the past decade as it’s grown more diverse.  Both 2008 presidential campaigns paid close attention to the county, but on Election Day, Obama won by a surprisingly strong 58-42 score. A Romney victory in Virginia likely begins with a solid showing here; since the Virginia polls close at 7 p.m., it will offer an early indicator of Romney’s suburban and exurban strength. Wisconsin  <paragraph>  Dane County Reliably liberal and the second most populous county after Milwaukee County, Madison’s Dane County is Wisconsin’s partisan counterbalance to GOP stronghold Waukesha County.  <paragraph>  Dane regularly delivers huge Democratic margins, so turnout here is important to the president’s chances of carrying the state for a second time — in 2008, Obama won Dane with 72 percent of the vote.  <paragraph>  Waukesha County If Romney isn’t winning two-thirds of the vote in this GOP bastion, he’s not winning Wisconsin. Like Gov. Scott Walker, who’s twice won more than 70 percent here, Romney needs to roll up big margins here in Wisconsin’s third-largest county, just west of Milwaukee. Without a strong Waukesha performance, it will be almost impossible to offset the Democratic margins coming out of Milwaukee and Dane counties. Michigan  <paragraph>  Oakland County Michigan is a longshot for Romney, to be sure. To have any chance of winning, he’ll need a strong performance in this historically Republican suburb of Detroit. Romney begins with at least one advantage: He grew up there, and his father served as the state’s governor.  <paragraph>  The state’s second-most populous county after Detroit’s Wayne County, Oakland has trended Democratic, but Romney is the kind of GOP nominee who could get traction in the white-collar suburbs here. Some recent polls have Romney winning Oakland and performing well in neighboring Macomb County, both of which are necessary elements of a Romney victory. Pennsylvania   <paragraph>  Bucks County If Obama’s winning here, chances are he’s also running well across the Philadelphia suburbs. With the big four suburban counties — Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery — in his pocket and an expected big Democratic margin out of Philadelphia, there’s almost no chance the president will lose the state.  <paragraph>  But Republicans are convinced they have an opportunity in the historically GOP-oriented Philly suburbs, which is why Romney appeared in Bucks County on Sunday, just two days before Election Day.
N.J. grapples with Sandy confusion |     <paragraph>      <picture>     <paragraph>  The Star Ledger  <hyperlink> reports Saturday that there’s widespread confusion across New Jersey “about polling locations, the logistics of Election Day under a state of emergency, and when the state will give voters more information.”  <paragraph> Conventional wisdom has held that, since New Jersey is a strongly Democratic state and Democratic strongholds in north Jersey took a beating from Hurricane Sandy, President Obama’s popular vote totals stands to be diminished by the prospect of decreased turnout.  <paragraph>   While that may be true, it’s often overlooked that the GOP vote could be significantly affected – the superstorm devastated some of the few Republican strongholds in the state, from Cape May north to Monmouth County. Ocean County, which delivered a 50,000-vote GOP margin in 2008, was especially hard hit.  <paragraph>   In any case, there's little evidence to suggest that the ultimate outcome is going be affected -- the state's 14 electoral votes appear firmly ensconced in the Democratic column.  <paragraph>    h t Ginger Gibson 
Obama leads among Asian Americans |  <paragraph>   A new California poll shows why President Barack Obama is again expected to capture the Asian American vote.  <paragraph>   In the state with by far the largest Asian population in the nation, the Field Poll reports Obama holds a 58 percent to 25 percent lead over Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>   In 2008, national exit polls gave Obama a 62 percent to 35 percent advantage over John McCain among Asians, who made up two percent of the electorate.  <paragraph>   According to a  <hyperlink>  Field Poll released Saturday, Obama runs best among California’s Chinese Americans, a group he wins by 63-21. The margin with Vietnamese Americans – a demographic that tends to be more Republican-friendly – is 47-27. Among Korean Americans, Obama leads 41-20 with 39 percent undecided -- the reported percentage of undecided voters among all Asian subgroups is unusually high for this late point in the campaign.  <paragraph>   Among other Asian groups, Obama leads 62-28.  <paragraph>   There’s no data for the Filipino American vote, a constituency where Republicans have had a toehold in the past.  <paragraph>   While the poll notes that the Asian subgroup samples are small, the numbers don’t seem dramatically at odds with a national poll conducted in April by the Democratic firm Lake Research Partners. Back then, nearly six in 10 Asian voters also favored Obama.
Final PPP poll: Warren leads Brown by 6 |   <paragraph>     <picture>    <paragraph>   In Public Policy Polling’s   <hyperlink> final Massachusetts poll, the Democratic firm reports Elizabeth Warren holds a 52 percent to 46 percent advantage over GOP Sen. Scott Brown.  <paragraph>   PPP is in line with 4 other pollsters – including Rasmussen – who have shown Warren with a 5 to 7 point edge since late October.  <paragraph>   If Brown falls short on Tuesday, he’ll rate as one of the most popular incumbents ever to lose a re-election bid. Many of his Senate colleagues would die for his approval ratings: according to PPP, 52 percent approve of his job performance, compared to just 36 percent who disapprove.  <paragraph>   Independents love him: He’s winning 59-38 among independents others and his approval ratings are 62-25.  <paragraph>   The hurdle Brown faces, of course, is the state’s lopsided Democratic registration advantage – 36 percent of voters are Democrats, compared to just 11 percent Republicans. Fifty-three percent are designated as unenrolled.  <paragraph>   If this latest PPP poll is correct, Warren is winning a higher percentage of Democrats than Martha Coakley, Brown’s Democratic opponent in 2010, and Brown is winning independents by a smaller margin.  <paragraph>   Simply put, given the political make-up of Massachusetts, Brown needs to be winning a greater share of Democratic and independent votes if he hopes to hold his seat on Election Day.
GOP ahead of 2008 early vote pace |  <paragraph>   Until Election Day, there’s no way to know for certain whether or not the GOP’s ground game is better this year than in 2008.  <paragraph>   But by one important yardstick – early voting – the GOP is showing notable improvement in key battleground states.  <paragraph>   According to data compiled by the   <hyperlink> United States Election Project and POLITICO, in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina, Republicans are running several points ahead of their 2008 pace, while Democrats are running several points behind, in percentage of early votes cast.  <paragraph>   Those five are the only swing states that have party registration or offer the statistical breakdowns that enable the comparison.  <paragraph>   In Colorado, Republicans have cast 38 percent of the early vote to 35 percent for Democrats and 27 percent for unaffiliated voters. Four years ago, the numbers were reversed: Democrats cast 38 percent, Republicans 36 percent and independents 26 percent.  <paragraph>   In Iowa, 43 percent of the early vote this year has been cast by Democrats, 32 percent by Republicans and 24 percent by no party or other. In 2008, the numbers were 47  D  29  R  24  NP .  <paragraph>   While Nevada doesn’t provide comparative statewide early vote data between 2008 and 2012, a similar pattern emerges in the two counties where the bulk of the state vote will be cast – the Democratic percentage of early votes is down slightly and there’s an uptick in the GOP percentage.  <paragraph>   In both Clark County  Las Vegas  and Washoe County  Reno , Democrats continue to outpace Republicans, but by a diminished margin over 2008.  <paragraph>   Back then, Democrats held a 52 percent to 31 percent early vote advantage in Clark County. This year, the margin is 48-33. In Washoe, it was 47-35 in 2008 and it’s 41-40 this year.  <paragraph>   It’s a mistake to draw too many conclusions from the swing state early vote numbers – early voting isn’t over yet and there are too many state-specific variables to make broad conclusions about what it all means.  <paragraph>   But, if nothing else, the early vote suggests that in the states where it matters most, GOP turnout efforts are better organized and operating at a higher level than four years ago. And that matters a great deal in an election that figures to be exceptionally close.
Van Hollen's mixed message |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   It's not uncommon to tailor campaign mailers to specific audiences, but when the messages are this contradictory they tend to stand out — particularly when the Maryland Democratic Party sends them to the same household.  <paragraph>   In this case, the Rep. Chris Van Hollen-as-Paul Ryan's-worst-nightmare piece was sent to the registered Democrat in the house while the more conciliatory 'what divides us' piece was directed to the registered independent.  <paragraph>   It would have been hard to overlook the difference between the red meat mailer and the kinder, gentler piece in any congressional district, but it's especially glaring in Van Hollen's suburban Maryland district, where a high percentage of his constituents work in government or the business of politics.  <paragraph>   In any case, Van Hollen is expected to cruise to an easy victory in his solidly Democratic district.
Jerry Brown's last stand |   <paragraph>     <picture>   <paragraph>   When it comes to   <hyperlink> Proposition 30, the bold tax initiative pushed by California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, the stakes are high — and not just because of the policy implications.  <paragraph>   Dan Walters, a widely respected Sacramento Bee columnist,  <hyperlink> writes that the 74-year-old governor’s legacy hangs in the balance: “   [H]e's now facing the possibility of defeat in what he hoped would be the signal accomplishment of his second governorship — persuading voters to raise taxes and close, albeit temporarily, a chronic state budget deficit.  Fixing California's budget was Brown's major campaign theme in 2010, 28 years after leaving the governorship. He could succeed where other governors — such as predecessor Arnold Schwarzenegger — had failed, he told voters, while promising that he wouldn't raise taxes without their approval. ”  <paragraph>   The polls report that the outcome is very much up in the air, with support just shy of 50 percent, leading Walters to ask, in the event of a loss, “would [Brown] figuratively shrug his shoulders and decide he might find more interesting and positive things to do in the remaining years of his life and forgo another reelection campaign in 2014?”  <paragraph>   There would be no shortage of Democratic talent if Brown declined to run again — Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has already said he will run if Brown doesn’t, and other prospective heavyweights include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Attorney General Kamala Harris.  <paragraph>   A serious primary challenge is also in the realm of possibility. The state’s new top-two primary system — where the top two finishers, regardless of party, move on to the general election — has reordered the state’s political calculus, and it’s not hard to envision scenarios in which it would make sense for an ambitious Democrat to take on a governor whose career in public office began more than four decades ago.
How Pennsylvania will be won |   <paragraph>   Maybe Pennsylvania is a GOP mirage, maybe it’s not.  <paragraph>   But if Mitt Romney is going to win the state, the victory will be powered by his performance in the Philadelphia suburbs, which is why he’ll appear at a suburban Bucks County event Sunday.  <paragraph>   For decades, the big four suburban counties -- Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery – were the engine of GOP statewide victories. But all of them began to drift out of the GOP orbit in the 1990s and they’ve been a big reason why a Republican presidential nominee hasn’t won the state since 1988.  <paragraph>   Without them, it’s nearly impossible for Republicans to counterbalance the big Democratic margins coming out of the city of Philadelphia.  <paragraph>   In 2008, when the suburbs cast 22 percent of the statewide vote, Obama won 57 percent in the four counties. For much of this year, he seemed poised to win them again: A late September Franklin & Marshall College poll had Obama leading 54-36 in the four counties, a lead that he had held for months.  <paragraph>   When Franklin & Marshall polled the state again in late October, however Romney had pulled ahead, 47-45. Whether or not Obama truly cratered in the Philly burbs as the F&M poll suggested, other polls – Susquehanna, internal polling for House candidates – also found that Romney was closing in the collar counties.  <paragraph>   Still, a narrow win in the suburbs of southeastern Pennsylvania probably won’t be enough to put Romney over the top.  <paragraph>   There's every sign he'll perform well in western Pennsylvania outside of Pittsburgh, but he’ll also need to run up the score in the section known as the Republican “T” -- the central part of the state and its northern tier of counties. And Romney will need to be far more competitive than John McCain was in the Lehigh Valley.  <paragraph>   Pennsylvania is an uphill climb for the GOP ticket, but it’s possible. Not without a foothold in the Philadelphia suburbs, though.
Making love out of nothing at all |  <paragraph>  The response to President Obama's same-sex marriage statement yesterday was fascinating on many fronts. Most entertaining was the reaction of the president's cheering section in the mainstream media.  <paragraph>  Who knew the New York Times could be such champions of states' rights?  <paragraph>  In fact, I think it is safe to say that this many Democrats haven't been as supportive of 10th Amendment federalism since Lester Maddox and George Wallace controlled Southern states during the days of segregation.  <paragraph>  The best laugh-out-loud moment came when the Times sent out a breathless breaking news alert at 3:16 pm, crammed with shameless spin and naked cheerleading. Public Editor Arthur Brisbane take note that the Newspaper of Record recorded the moment this way:  <paragraph>   President Obama declared for the first time that he supports same-sex marriage, putting the moral power of his presidency behind a social issue that continues to divide the country.   <paragraph>  The moral power of his presidency? Really?  <paragraph>  Exactly how did the New York Times come to that conclusion when Barack Obama said he would not use his power as president to stop others from banning gay marriage?  <paragraph>  Did any member of the Times newsroom actually believe that the president was ever personally against same-sex marriage? Where was the editor who approved that language over the past decade?  <paragraph>  Do these progressive cheerleaders of the president realize that their hero has now adopted a position on gay marriage that is horrifyingly close to the views of Ron Paul, Barry Goldwater, William F. Buckley, Ronald Reagan and yes, even me.  <paragraph>  If not, they should.  <paragraph>  Since I believe that most social issues should be handled on the state level, Barack Obama's declaration was like Morning in America all over again!  <paragraph>  But the impact of Obama's statement may not be so positive in the long run for America's top newspapers and networks. They continue to be enablers of a liberal politician who has long played a cynical game on an issue critical to most who run those same media outlets.  <paragraph>  Is a Democratic victory in November really that important to these journalists or are they just blinded by love? The only thing that the statement by the president proved is that those same news organizations are now defending a position on gay marriage that would make Bill Buckley proud.
Newt Gingrich's real legacy |    <paragraph>  With Newt Gingrich's belated exit from the Republican presidential campaign, now is a good time to ask what impact his vertiginous race will have on his legacy.   <paragraph>  My guess? Not much.  <paragraph>  Sure, we learned that the former speaker is undisciplined on the campaign trail, has a tumultuous past and is often ideologically inconsistent. But that's not news to anyone who worked with Mr. Gingrich for more than a week while he served in Congress. And Newt Gingrich served in Congress for a very long time.  <paragraph>  Instead, 2012 is just one more reminder of how in politics, a politician's past is always prologue. For Newt's campaign staff, that proved to be bad news.  <paragraph>   <hyperlink> PHOTOS: Newt Gingrich's career   <paragraph>  But despite the withering critiques of many  including myself , give Mr. Gingrich his due. History will record him as one of the most significant Republican figures of the last 50 years. For a short while in the 1990s, Newt Gingrich bent history. <paragraph>  He led Republicans to a majority in the House for the first time in 40 years,  He led the fight to balance the budget for the first time in a generation, He helped balance that budget for four consecutive years for the first time since the 1920s, He rammed through welfare reform despite initial opposition from Bill Clinton and the Democrats, and He extended the life of Medicare when Democrats chose to demagogue the issue  <paragraph>  Of course, many will also blame the Gingrich speakership for the poisonous atmosphere that infects Washington today, but vicious personal attacks in American politics predated Newt's 1994 rise by about 220 years. And since many of the same people who judged Gingrich for his take-no-hostages approach remained silent when Ted Kennedy accused Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork of supporting segregation, back-alley abortions and midnight police raids, those critiques are not worth the paper on which they are written.  <paragraph>  Newt Gingrich may have turned negative campaigning into a dark art form, but he was not its inventor.  <paragraph>  Newt's more lasting legacy will be what he accomplished in 1995 and 1996. For those achievements, Speaker Gingrich will long be remembered as the man who brought the Reagan Revolution to the Legislative Branch. That legacy remains secure tonight despite the ending of a very sloppy campaign.
Politics and the endless war |  <paragraph>  The president's prime-time address tonight put a bow on the political gift Osama bin Laden's death provided Team Obama.  <paragraph>  Did the White House politicize the terror chief's death? Of course. Is it breaking news that an administration would do such a thing? Of course not.  <paragraph>  In 1960, John Kennedy created a missile gap with the Soviets out of thin air to defeat Richard Nixon.  <paragraph>  Four years later, LBJ shamelessly used his  Daisy  ad to suggest that a Goldwater administration would cause a nuclear war.  <paragraph>  In 1968, Richard Nixon lied about a secret plan to get out of Vietnam.  <paragraph>  In 2002, Karl Rove and the GOP used September 11th as a wedge issue against Democratic candidates.  <paragraph>  And in 2012, President Obama is using the killing of Osama bin Laden as a political tool.  <paragraph>  If you are shocked by such things, get over it. Be more concerned  with the president's declaration that U.S. troops will be in Afghanistan until 2024. That reality means Americans who were not even born on Sept. 11, 2001, will be occupying Afghanistan 20 years after those attacks. Never mind that the epicenter of Al Qaeda's operation has moved to Yemen or that U.S. taxpayers are doling out $2 billion a week on a war whose main purpose is propping up one of the most corrupt regimes on the face of the Earth.  <paragraph>  Making matters worse is the fact that Mr. Obama's opponents in the GOP want to stay longer. <paragraph>  The takeaway of President Obama's speech tonight is simple. The neocons won, the troops lost and the endless war grinds on in a land that humbled the Soviet Union, the British Empire and Alexander the Great. Good luck with that, Mr. President.
Hoover, Carter and cheap shots |  <paragraph>   Politics ain't beanbag,  wrote Finley Peter Dunne in an 1895 newspaper column explaining how Washington is not for the weak-hearted. And Mr. Dunne was right.  <paragraph>  All those hoping to find charity, love and justice on the campaign trail would do best to seek out the nearest church pew to rest their weary bones. That is because young politicians are taught daily just how rough the sport can be.  <paragraph>  In Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy's new book The President's Club, we see time and again how ex-presidents have been swept aside with brutish efficiency by the incoming president - whether it was Dwight Eisenhower coldly dispatching his former boss Harry Truman or John Kennedy dismissing Ike eight years later because he believed wrongly that the old general was hopelessly out of touch.   <paragraph>  But one of the most glaring examples of a president throwing a high, inside fastball on one of his predecessors was after Harry Truman had used Herbert Hoover from 1945 through 1948 to save millions of Europeans from starving after World War II. Truman also tapped Hoover to reorganize the federal government in a way that dramatically impacts even Barack Obama today. The alliance between Truman and Hoover was historic and, before long, the formerly disgraced GOP president became one of the most-admired men in America.   <paragraph>  Then came the 1948 election.  <paragraph>  Although Hoover gave the president his word that he would remain positive throughout the election, Gibbs and Duffy tell us that Harry Truman unloaded on the man who helped him save Europe from starvation and Soviet influence. On the campaign trail he would blame Hoover and the Republicans for causing the Great Depression while privately he would say,  That man was no more responsible for starting the Depression than you or me.   <paragraph>  But for Truman, politics was a tough game played by tough men, so he didn't give his strategy a second thought. And although Herbert Hoover was hurt by his friend's attacks, he swallowed his pride and continued his efforts reorganizing the executive branch for Truman and his successors.  <paragraph>  Given the long history of former presidents being used as political punching bags, I suppose I should not be surprised that these kind of attacks continue today. But I do wish ex-presidents would show the dignity and grace of George H.W. Bush in respecting the office of the presidency so much that they would choose to refrain from besmirching a member of the President's Club.  <paragraph>  I know this sounds old-fashioned and a bit out of touch with the realities of the 24 7 culture but I still revere the presidency even if I have been less than thrilled with the performance of some of its recent occupants.  <paragraph>  Which leads to a story that POLITICO is covering today regarding a man who hopes to become a member of the President's Club next January. Today, we heard Mitt Romney take a shot at the 39th president of the United States, Jimmy Carter. In responding to a reporter's question as to whether Romney would have ordered an attack on Osama bin Laden, the Republican front-runner said that  even Jimmy Carter would have ordered the attack.    <paragraph>  That a GOP candidate would use Carter as a political target is not a surprise. We Republicans - and I include myself here - have been using President Carter as a political target for as long as Democrats lashed out at Hoover. But considering that Carter did the unthinkable by 2012 standards last week and praised Mitt Romney, I found his cheap shot at President Carter to be a bit jarring.  <paragraph>  Also, I wonder if there should be a statute of limitations on the political attacks the 39th president has to absorb. As a conservative who has been criticizing the former president for almost four decades now, I say enough is enough. All one has to do is read a few pages of Jimmy Carter's White House Diary or his recent Bible guide to get a better understanding of the challenges that constantly faced the man from Plains when he lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  <paragraph>  His were the same kind of monumental crises that Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton stared down daily. And while I will be the first to say that the people and the press have every right to challenge a sitting president every step of the way, I would suggest that after a president has been out of the Oval Office for 30 years, politicians should look elsewhere for cheap shots.
George W. Bush's friends on the left |   <paragraph>  For a president who left office loathed by progressives and most of polite society, <hyperlink> George W. Bush continues to gain admirers among those whom liberals admire most.  <paragraph>   <hyperlink>  U2 frontman and legendary do-gooder Bono shocked many when he told Jon Stewart that George W. Bush did an  amazing  job in his work involving AIDS in Africa.  <paragraph>   I know that's hard for you to accept,  Bono told the host,  but George kind of knocked it out of the park. I can tell you, and I'm actually here to tell you that America now has 5 million people being kept alive by these drugs. That's something that everyone should know.   <paragraph>  Another secular saint of the left, Sir Bob Geldof, has been even more direct in his praise of the conservative ex-president.  <paragraph>  Geldof told reporters that he was  pissed off  by the media's refusal to report the truth about Bush's good works, saying that when it came to saving Africa, George W. Bush  has done more than any other president so far.   <paragraph>   This is the triumph of American policy really,  he said.  It was probably unexpected of the man. It was expected of the nation, but not of the man, but both rose to the occasion.   <paragraph>   What's in it for Mr. Bush? Absolutely nothing,  Geldof told reporters.  <paragraph>  Then there is the interview that is airing Wednesday on  <hyperlink> Piers Morgan in which the CNN host asks His Holiness what leaders he respects. After bringing up Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama then moves on to a more unlikely politician.  <paragraph>   I love President Bush,  the Dalai Lama said.   Which one?  Morgan asked.   The younger one.    Shocked by the response, Morgan asked incredulously,  Really?     Yes, really,  the Dalai Lama insisted,  I love him.   <paragraph>    <hyperlink> Also on POLITICO: Dalai Lama: I love George W. Bush   <paragraph>  Those strong words from His Holiness surprise even conservatives like myself who faulted Bush for huge deficits and a reckless foreign policy. But reading this lavish praise from the likes of the Dalai Lama, Bono and Bob Geldof should remind narrow-minded leftists who view Mr. Bush through ideological blinders that turning political opponents into cartoon characters is the work of fools. <paragraph>  And for conservatives who have spent the past three years calling Barack Obama every name in the book, that applies to you as well. We can disagree with our political opponents without turning them into evil villains. As the Dalai Lama himself once famously said,  Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible. 
Some liberals ask: What would Jerry do? |   <paragraph>  Since Jerry Falwell founded The Moral Majority in 1979, few things have unified American liberals as much as their contempt for self-righteous types who pushed a political agenda by attacking the faith of partisan opponents.  <paragraph>  For over a quarter of a century, left-wing thought leaders have roundly  and rightly  condemned those who self-righteously attacked political foes for their religious beliefs. In recent years, some on the right embarrassed themselves by questioning the faith of a president who publicly declared his faith in Jesus Christ as his Lord and personal savior.  <paragraph>  That is why it is so surprising that some supporters of the president are starting to attack Republicans based on religion. Mitt Romney's faith is now attacked on news networks and by liberal websites, suggesting that Mormonism is a cult and that Mitt Romney is heading for Hell. Others are claiming that Jesus Christ would be upset at the priorities laid out in the GOP House Budget for FY 2013. <paragraph>  What a joke.  <paragraph>  Supporters of the president would do better to focus on creating jobs than channeling Jesus. Their recent attacks make them look as pathetic as those conservatives who refuse to take President Obama's testimony at face value.
Let the horse race begin |  <paragraph>  No sooner did Rick Santorum leave the Republican race for president than Gallup announced the start of its daily tracking poll. That means that every afternoon for the next 201 days, we will be greeted with horse-race updates that are sure to be followed by breathless headlines about how that day's results surely spell doom for President Obama or Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>  On this second day of Gallup's tracking poll, the survey was met with a screaming headline on The Drudge Report that yelled  SHOCK POLL!  So what's the earth-shattering news that deserved such a headline? It's that Mitt Romney leads the president by five points - 48% to 43%.  <paragraph>  Put as much stock in this poll as the ones that declared a few weeks back that the president was ahead of Romney by double digits. The next time you believe a result like that, step away from your laptop, get out of your mother's basement and take a walk around the block.  <paragraph>  Both campaigns will tell anyone who is listening that the Obama-Romney showdown will be decided in the final weeks of the campaign - with the outcome resting on unemployment rates, gas prices and their impact on swing states like Florida, Ohio and Virginia.  <paragraph>  So take a deep breath. We are still in the preseason for presidential campaigns. As the Boston Red Sox cruelly taught their fans again last season, winning big in the spring doesn't mean jack. It's how your side performs when the leaves start to change colors. Considering they still haven't sprouted throughout most of New England, this race still has a long way to go.
In denial about debt crisis |   <paragraph>   With George Soros warning of a growing European crisis, the economic clouds that have been forming over Washington for years are growing darker by the day. While Soros fears that Europe's austerity measures will lead to a financial meltdown in the EU, at least European governments are trying something, anything, to stem the debt crisis.  <paragraph>  Stateside, today's events in Congress show just how ill-equipped our government is to face the coming storm.   <paragraph>  President Obama pushed for a Senate vote today on the Buffett Rule as a way to get rich Americans to pay more taxes. Of course, the president always knew the rule was more gimmick than economic panacea. He also knew it would never pass out of the least productive Senate in 20 years.   <paragraph>  Not to be outdone, House Republicans are pushing for a vote on a tax cut for businesses with less than 500 employees. Like the Buffett Rule, the Eric Cantor-backed tax cut has no chance of passing both chambers and ending up on the president's desk.  <paragraph>  The Washington Post summed up the parties' political gimmickry this afternoon:  In a gridlocked Congress, passage was never the point. Instead, both parties aim to force their opponents into the politically uncomfortable position of killing proposals they are convinced are broadly popular.  <paragraph>  To drive home the point that legislating is now little more than campaigning by different means, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer used the occasion of today's vote to suggest the provision's name should be changed to  The Romney Rule  because the presumptive GOP nominee is so rich.  <paragraph>  With all the game playing that is going on inside the Beltway, it is fair for voters to ask whether any adults are left working in a town that is always concerned with winning the next election rather than the new century.
Economic help for Obama |   <paragraph>  The Wall Street Journal editorial page usually has little good to say about <hyperlink>  President Obama's economic agenda. But today's Journal was brimming with good news for a White House facing reelection during tough economic times. From front to back, the WSJ was filled with upbeat  <hyperlink>   economic news. Considering Friday's disappointing jobs numbers, the good news must have been a welcome respite for the White House.  <paragraph>  The paper's lead article showcased a study declaring that U.S. companies were emerging stronger from the Great Recession than they were even before the 2008 financial meltdown. The Journal quoted Wells Fargo's former chief economist who said the last few years have made U.S. companies  leaner, meaner and hungrier.  That positive sentiment was backed by a WSJ analysis that showed sales, profits and employment higher among the Standard and Poor's companies than in 2007.  <paragraph>  That front page story was coupled with hopeful headlines from the Journal's opinion pages. Historian Walter Russell Mead's op-ed  The Myth of America's Decline  argued that, while power has become dispersed among more global players    <hyperlink>  China, India,  <hyperlink>  Brazil, Turkey, Japan and Europe , the United States remains the  Chairman of the Board  on most global matters.  <paragraph>  Next to Mead's article was an opinion page headline asking  Who Deserves Credit for the Improving Economy?   Even though the article warns of a coming fiscal cliff in 2013, most incumbents would put this op-ed under the  Just-Spell-My-Name-Right  category.  <paragraph>  If opinion writers spend the next year haggling over who should get the credit for America's improving economy, Barack Obama will be a happy man and Republicans will start planning for 2014.
The message of Jesus |  <paragraph>  With the holiest week of the year coming to an end, now is a good time to reflect on the message of Jesus that has been twisted in knots by televangelists and politicians in our time.   <paragraph>  Jesus is not about getting rich. He's about feeding the poor.  <paragraph>  Jesus doesn't care about putting your favorite politician first. He cares about you putting yourself last.  <paragraph>  He doesn't want you to listen to self-righteous televangelists or self-promoting politicians. Instead, he wants you to read his words and learn the truth. And for the purposes of those who read this column, Jesus never focused on politics. He remained silent on gay marriage, liberation theology or abortion wars.  But he did command us to love others, forgive others and serve others.  <paragraph>  Then he told us we should love others more than we love ourselves, that we should love our enemies, that we must turn the other cheek, that the peacemakers are blessed and that we must focus more on our own sins instead of judging the faults of others.  <paragraph>  And when Jesus' disciples asked what they needed to do to get to Heaven, his answer was simple: care for the poor, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, give water to the thirsty, visit those in prison and bring hope to the hopeless.  <paragraph>  That is a radically different message than the one we hear from popular culture and misguided ministers. But that message contained in Matthew 25 remains the heart of the Son of God's message 2,000 years after he rose from the grave.  <paragraph>  That's also a message that sinners like myself must always remember and be challenged by every day.
Allen campaign, NRSC pulled DC radio buys | <paragraph>  George Allen's U.S. Senate campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee each recently canceled two weeks of radio ads across the D.C. metro area, according to documents obtained by POLITICO.  <paragraph>  Allen's campaign and the GOP committee said the cancellations were routine reallocations of advertising in the race to replace retiring Sen. Jim Webb  D-Va.   <paragraph>   We were going up on TV around that time and we bought radio outside  the D.C. area instead, Dan Allen of the George Allen campaign said Tuesday.  <paragraph>   It’s common for both parties to adjust reservations in the final weeks and to shift money between TV and radio. But we have long viewed Virginia as one of our top takeover opportunities, and the millions of dollars we are spending in this race reflects that,  the NRSC's Brian Walsh said.  <paragraph>  Records obtained by POLITICO show that on Sept. 19, Allen's media buyers notified radio stations in the D.C. area of a  marketwide  cancellation of ads set to run from Sept. 25 to Oct. 8.  <paragraph>  And on Sept. 27, the NRSC's media buyers told radio stations that it was backing out of reservations in the D.C. market for Oct. 10 to Oct. 23.  <paragraph>  A Republican source said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee doesn’t currently have any radio ad time reserved in Virginia, but as of now the NRSC is still booked on the radio for the final three weeks of the campaign.  <paragraph>  However, Allen rival Tim Kaine's campaign has its own radio ad time booked from late August through November. The records reviewed by POLITICO did not show any Kaine cancellations of radio time on major D.C. stations during the period.
Court overturns conviction of bin Laden driver |  <paragraph>  A federal appeals court significantly narrowed the power of the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay by ruling Tuesday that those tribunals have no authority to try prisoners for providing assistance to terrorist organizations before 2006. <paragraph>  The ruling from a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the military commission conviction of Salim Hamdan, a Yemeni man who served as a driver to Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. Hamdan was transferred to Yemen in 2008 and released, but the court's ruling could affect other military commission cases. <paragraph>  The judges ruled that material support of terrorism, a common terrorism-related charge in U.S. civilian criminal courts, is not a war crime under international law and therefore is beyond the scope of what military commissions were permitted to do as originally constituted. <paragraph>   When Hamdan committed the conduct in question, the international law of war proscribed a variety of war crimes, including forms of terrorism. At that time, however, the international law of war did not proscribe material support for terrorism as a war crime. Indeed, the Executive Branch acknowledges that the international law of war did not – and still does not – identify material support for terrorism as a war crime. Therefore, the relevant statute at the time of Hamdan’s conduct....did not proscribe material support for terrorism as a war crime,  Judge Brett Kavanuagh wrote.  The opinion is posted   <hyperlink> here.   <paragraph>  In a footnote, Kavanaugh noted that the ruling would not require Hamdan's release, since he could be detained under the law of war.  Presumably, this was a note about the opinion's application to others still at Guantanamo Bay.  The judge also noted that Hamdan could be charged for post-2006 material support in a military commission.  <paragraph>  There is little dispute that Hamdan could have been charged with material support in front of a civilian U.S. court, but such trials are oridnarily held only on U.S. soil and Congress has now essentially forbidden bringing current Guantanamo prisoners to the U.S. The court's ruling Tuesday leaves open the government's ability to use military commissions to charge individuals with established war crimes, such as intentional killing of non-combatants.  <paragraph>  Judges David Sentelle and Douglas Ginsburg joined in the vast majority of Kavanaugh's opinion. Ginsburg wrote a separate opinion saying that he would prefer to rule that the case was moot since Hamdan was returned to Yemen. However, Ginsburg agreed with the other judges that under current Supreme Court precedent, which lower courts are bound to follow, the case was not moot.  <paragraph>  Several other prisoners at Guantanamo have been convicted of material support, though the only one charged solely with that offense appears to be Australian David Hicks. He pled guilty in 2007 and was transferred to Australia, where he was released a few months later.  <paragraph>  Kavanaugh was appointed to the D.C. Circuit by President George W. Bush. Sentelle and Ginsburg are both appointees of President Ronald Reagan.  <paragraph>  Of course, they may not have the final word on the matter. The Justice Department could ask the full bench of the D.C. Circuit to hear the case or ask the Supreme Court to take it up.  <paragraph>  A Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment.
DOJ: No role for courts in Fast and Furious contempt fight |  <paragraph>  The federal courts have no authority to intervene in the dispute that led to President Barack Obama asserting executive privilege for the first time in the context of a Congressional inquiry, the Justice Department argued in a legal brief filed Monday night.  <paragraph>  Soon after that assertion of privilege in June, the House voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents related to a House probe of the Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal.  <paragraph>  The Justice Department brief  posted   <hyperlink> here  argues that the executive branch's decision not to comply with such subpoenas or portions thereof cannot be second-guessed or rejected by the judiciary—a sweeping claim of executive power that aligns the Obama administration with the stance President George W. Bush's administration took in a similar dispute in 2008.  <paragraph>   An assumption of jurisdiction here would short-circuit the constitutional design and threaten to alter permanently the relationship among the Branches,  Justice Department lawyers contend in the 46-page brief, arguing that Congress has many other avenues open to it to try to force compliance with the subpoena.  Filing suit is far easier than mustering the votes necessary to cut appropriations, defeat legislation, or override a veto, and is far less visible to constituents. A decision allowing the case to proceed would thus greatly diminish the political costs of inter-Branch confrontation and reduce the incentive for Congress to evaluate and prioritize the demands of its myriad committees.   <paragraph>  The brief notes at length the extensive back-and-forth between the Justice Department and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee over documents related to the panel's probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operation that reportedly allowed as many as 2000 firearms to flow from legal U.S. gun dealers to narcotraffickers in Mexico.  <paragraph>  One of the resolutions of contempt voted against Holder in June authorized the filing of a lawsuit to enforce the committee's subpoena. The panel   <hyperlink> filed such a suit in July in U.S. District Court in Washington.  <paragraph>   This Court should not permit the Committee to circumvent this historical—and in this case, fruitful—process of negotiation and accommodation by seeking resolution of this inherently political dispute in federal court,  the Justice Department argues in the new brief.  <paragraph>  The brief asserts that stepping into the Fast and Furious subpoena dispute would start down a slippery slope that could upend separation of powers by involving the courts in a wide array of disagreements between Congress and the Executive Branch.  <paragraph>   If a committee of Congress could sue the Executive Branch on the basis of a claimed loss of power in a political dispute, then there would be little question that the President or subordinate officials of the Executive Branch would be entitled to bring political disputes with Congress into the judicial forum....Thus, the Judiciary would become the final arbiter of any political dispute between the Branches—or even one between officials of the same Branch—a result that is contrary to our constitutional scheme,  the Justice Department lawyers write.  <paragraph>   A court would have to weigh the relative interests of the political Branches and decide which interest prevails, either by elevating one over the other on a categorical basis or by enmeshing the court in the minutiae of the dispute between the Branches. Such an unmoored weighing of the interests of the political Branches is one the courts are ill-equipped to make,  the brief continues.  <paragraph>  The brief also notes repeatedly that thousands of documents related to the gun operation itself have been turned over to Congress. The present dispute pertains to documents that indicate how the Justice Department and others in the federal government responded to Congressional and media inquiries about the matter.  <paragraph>  Unsurprisingly, the Justice Department brief argues that legal precedent favors the courts staying out of such fights. However, the brief acknowledges that just four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge John Bates ruled that the courts did have authority to force Bush White House officials, including White House Counsel Harriet Miers, to respond to subpoenas from a House committee investigating the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys. <paragraph>  The Miers decision  went down the wrong path, and there have now been more congressional suits challenging executive privilege in the past five years  two  than in the previous 220 years combined. This Court should reject the rash call for judicial intervention here, lest the constitutionally-sanctioned and time-honored process of negotiation and accommodation itself becomes a thing of the past,  the Justice Department lawyers argue.  <paragraph>  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stayed Bates's ruling pending an appeal, but the case was resolved without a definitive appellate ruling in the early weeks of the Obama administration. <paragraph>  The committee's suit against Holder has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who was appointed to the bench by Obama last year. Due to the briefing schedule in the case, no ruling is expected until well after the election.
Three journalists subpoenaed by defense in CIA leak case | <paragraph>  Three journalists subpoenaed by the defense in the criminal case against of former Central Intelligence Agency officer John Kiriakou will fight efforts to force them to testify in the case, according to court filings and spokespeople for the news outlets involved.  <paragraph>  The journalists being pressed for testimony are Scott Shane of the New York Times, Julie Tate of the Washington Post and freelancer Matthew Cole, sources told POLITICO.  <paragraph>  The subpoenas seek to force Shane, Tate and Cole to attend depositions and answer defense questions, apparently about classified information related to the CIA's interrogation of alleged terrorists. Prosecutors have indicated they don't plan to call journalists as part of their case.  <paragraph>  Shane and Cole were mentioned in Kiriakou's indictment, though not by name, as recipients of classified information about the identities of CIA personnel involved in the spy agency's  Rendition, Detention and Interrogation  program.  <paragraph>  Tate, a Post researcher who worked on stories about the Guantanamo prisoners and helped develop a Post database of the inmates, was not mentioned in the indictment. However, Kiriakou's lawyers said in a court filing  information developed by Mr. Kiriakou's defense indicates that Researcher 1 [Tate] participated with Journalist A  [Cole] in certain activities alleged in the Indictment.   <paragraph>  A New York Times spokeswoman said the paper will fight the subpoena to Shane, whose reporting on interrogations was specifically cited in Kiriakou's indictment.  We generally oppose subpoenas that seek the testimony of our journalists and we plan to oppose this one,  Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy wrote in an e-mail.  <paragraph>  A spokeswoman for the Post had no immediate comment, but a lawyer for the paper said Tate will seek to block the subpoena issued to her.  We plan to file a motion to quash the subpoena on behalf of Ms. Tate,  Williams and Connolly attorney William Doffermyre said in an e-mail.  <paragraph>  Cole's lawyer, Mark Zaid, filed papers in federal court in Alexandria, Va. Thursday asking that the subpoena against his client be thrown out. Zaid said Cole is protected from testifying by the First Amendment and by a reporter's privilege. However, Zaid also said his client, if forced to appear, would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights because he faces a real threat of prosecution for revealing classified information at the deposition.  Cole's motion is posted   <hyperlink> here.   <paragraph>  It's unclear precisely what information the defense is seeking from the journalists, but it may be seeking to demonstrate that some of the information the government contends it was making efforts to keep secret was in fact being circulated outside the government.  <paragraph>  Depositions are unusual in criminal cases but Kiriakou's defense team argues they are necessary because of special rules that apply to the use of classified national security information in court. The prosecution is   <hyperlink> opposing holding the depositions.  <paragraph>  Kiriakou is facing one charge of disclosing the identity of a covert officer, three counts of violating the Espionage Act by revealing closely-held national defense information, and one count of lying to the CIA's Publications Review Board.  <paragraph>  The press subpoenas were first reported Thursday by Steven Aftergood on the   <hyperlink> Federation of American Scientists's Secrecy News blog. However, Tate was identified in that account only as  Researcher 1,  the way she is generically referred to in court papers. Shane's identity is evident from the indictment. Cole's link to the case was   <hyperlink> first reported on this blog in April.  <paragraph>  Defense lawyers   <hyperlink> indicated in July that they wanted to talk with journalists about the case, but there was no talk at that time of compelling witnesses to testify.  <paragraph>  It's unclear why the names of the journalists are being redacted from public court records. While unindicted third parties are not usually named in indictments, they are usually identified publicly in subsequent court filings.
Alito speaks up for Asian Americans | <paragraph>  When the Supreme Court took up the issue of Affirmative Action in higher education Wednesday for the first time in nearly a decade, Justice Samuel Alito seemed to be particularly focused on the program's impact on Asian Americans.  <paragraph>  As lawyer Greg Garre sought to defend the University of Texas's Affirmative Action program, Alito asked about an unusual aspect of the school's racial preference system: it actually seeks out African Americans and Latinos who are privileged socioeconomically and provides a boost in the admissions process.  <paragraph>   You specifically have the example of the child of successful professionals in Dallas...If you have -you have an applicant whose parents are -- let's say they're — one of them is a partner in your law firm in Texas, another one is a part — is another corporate lawyer. They have income that puts them in the top 1 percent of earners in the country, and they have — parents both have graduate degrees. They deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely average in terms of education and income?  Alito asked.  <paragraph>   No,  Garre insisted.  We want minorities from different backgrounds. We go out of our way to recruit minorities from disadvantaged backgrounds,  he said, apparently alluding to another program mandated by state law that admits the top 10 percent of each high school class—effectively admitting a large number of Latinos and African Americans.  <paragraph>  Later, Alito returned again to the issue of whether Asian Americans were being treated fairly in the admissions process.  <paragraph>   In terms of diversity, how do you justify lumping together all Asian Americans? Do you think — do you have a critical mass of Filipino Americans? Cambodian Americans?  Alito asked.  <paragraph>   The common form that's used has Asian American, but also, next to that, has a form that says country of origin where that can be spelled out,  Garre replied.  <paragraph>   But do you have a critical mass as to all the subgroups that fall within this enormous group of Asian Americans?  Alito asked.  <paragraph>   Your Honor, we've looked to whether or not we have a critical mass of underrepresented minorities, which is precisely what the Grutter decision asks us to do,  Garre said.  <paragraph>  Alito was arguably the most forceful and argumentative challenger of the Texas program among the justices at Wednesday's arguments. Affirmative action is apparently a subject matter he's had an interest in for some time. At his confirmation hearings in 2006, it emerged that when applying for a job in the Reagan Administration in 1995, Alito listed himself as a member of Concerned Alumni of Princeton, a group whose members expressed concern about rising numbers of women at the university and also challenged some of the school's Affirmative Action practices.  <paragraph>  At his hearings, Alito said he had no recollection of involvement with the group, but may have joined because of its work to support the presence of ROTC military officer training on campus.  <paragraph>  A full transcript of Wednesday's oral arguments is posted   <hyperlink> here.
Did Obama back bans on hate speech? |  <paragraph>  A report Monday on The Daily Caller website argues that when President Barack Obama was a student at Harvard Law School he endorsed the idea of restricting speech in order to protect minorities.  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> The report is a bit short, though, on specifics to back up its conclusion. It hangs largely on a 13-word quote from a panel discussion in which Obama said:  I don’t see a lot of conservatives getting upset if minorities feel silenced.  The Caller also cites the recollection of a participant in the panel discussion, Brian Timmons, that all the six panelists except him  promoted the same view.  However, Timmons is not quoted offering any specific recollection of what the future president said during the discussion, which included future Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.  <paragraph>  A close reading of the underlying source material, a write-up in the Harvard Law School yearbook, suggests the panel discussed a variety of different subjects ranging from whether an atmosphere of political correctness was unwisely limiting the number of views on campus to whether rules or laws should be imposed to protect minorities from offensive speech.  One of the earliest forays in this battle, a University of Michigan code banning racist or sexist speech, was struck down by a federal court in 1989.   <paragraph>  Frankly, it wouldn't be surprising if Obama sided with those less supportive of free speech in the campus battles of the 1980s and early 1990s. Many prominent scholars on the left seemed enamored by that position in that era, including  <hyperlink> another future Supreme Court justice, Elena Kagan. The issue split groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, though the pro-free-speech forces ultimately carried the day. <paragraph>  However, the Caller's evidence stops short of putting Obama firmly in the speech-restricting camp. The direct quote reads like a rebuttal to someone else's argument, not a direct endorsement of a particular position or policy. And, of course, it was more than 20 years ago, while he was a student, so not the greatest evidence of his current views.  <paragraph>  Still, it's an interesting data point, especially at a time when the question of offensive speech is in the news as a result of the violence in the Muslim world directed at an anti-Muslim video produced in the U.S.  <paragraph>  Obama didn't offer a vocal defense of free speech principles in his first public comments on the video, though later that same day he said in an interview:  We believe in the First Amendment. It is one of the hallmarks of our Constitution that I’m sworn to uphold.  And so we are always going to uphold the rights for individuals to speak their mind. On the other hand, this film is not representative of who we are and our values, and I think it's important for us to communicate that.   <paragraph>  Obama also presented  <hyperlink> a vigorous defense of free speech principles at the United Nations last month.
White House VIP missing from 'West Wing Week' |    <paragraph>  <video> <paragraph>  Guess who doesn't appear in the latest edition of  West Wing Week,  a video series the White House cranks out to promote the work of President Barack Obama and his administration?  <paragraph>  Yep, the seniormost of senior White House officials: President Barack Obama.  <paragraph>  The reason for his startling absence: a lack of official presidential events in a week the president largely spent campaigning and preparing for Wednesday's night's debate with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.  <paragraph>  Due to the Hatch Act, the federally funded  West Wing Week  isn't allowed to feature political events like fundraisers, election rallies and debates  not that the White House would necessarily be promoting a lot of last week's match-up . In most weeks, that restriction isn't a big deal. But, last week, there were apparently no official events on Obama's schedule suitable to be sliced-and-diced by the White House videomakers.  <paragraph>  According to public schedules released by the White House, the only official events Obama took part in last week were four national security briefings. However, as I reported last month, the public schedule is   <hyperlink> far from a complete roster of official or unofficial presidential events.  <paragraph>  With little grist for the mill last week, the White House video team turned its attention to innovative financial and energy-related smartphone apps and a look at the selection of the White House Christmas tree in North Carolina.  <paragraph>  A White House spokesman says it's not the first time Obama has been left out of his own White House's rundown of  everything that's happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Even though the video feature regularly goes on the road with him across the country and around the world, there have been  a few  holiday and vacation periods where the president didn't make the final cut, the aide said. <paragraph>  There should be some usable footage of Obama in the coming week, though. He's scheduled to announce the designation of a new national monument to late labor leader Cesar Chavez in California on Monday.
Tax expert: Romney deduction cap doesn't compute |  <paragraph>  At what level would one have to cap itemized tax deductions to pay for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's proposed reduction in income tax rates?  <paragraph>  Romney suggested in an interview this week that a $17,000 limit might do it. In the debate Wednesday night, he said:  Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people.   <paragraph>  There's no reason, though, that the number has to be so vague. Romney's plan includes a specified number of tax cuts, including lower rates, eliminating the estate tax and abolishing the alternative minimum tax. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan outfit that analyzed Romney's cuts, put the total at $4.8 trillion over 10 years.  <paragraph>  So, I asked one of the center's scholars Thursday what number Romney would have to use as a deduction cap in order to make  revenue neutral  the $4.8 trillion in cuts.  <paragraph>   It's a negative number,  said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, which joins with the Brookings Institution to run the Tax Policy Center.  <paragraph>   A negative number?  I said.  <paragraph>   There are not enough itemized deductions to offset his rate cuts,  Williams said, adding that eliminating all itemized deductions for all income groups would not cover the tab for the proposed cuts. There's just not enough money there.   <paragraph>  The Romney campaign didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this post, but it has accused the TPC of bias. During the debate, Romney said other analysts have a different take.  There are all these studies out there,  he said. He also said his tax proposals would unleash hiring and economic growth that would, in turn, generate added revenue.  <paragraph>  A tax expert with the Heritage Foundation, Bill Beach, said it was unfair to assume that the deductions cap would have to offset the entirety of Romney's rate cuts. He said Romney could pick up additional revenues through capital gains taxes collected after repeal of the estate tax and through repatriation of assets now held abroad. Beach also said the TPC analysis made assumptions that weren't necessarily accurate.  <paragraph>   We don’t run tax plans unless we have detail on the tax plans,  Beach said.  President Obama's tax plan is not that much more detailed.   <paragraph>  Williams said capping deductions would be  a very progressive tax change,  because only about 30 percent of taxpayers itemize in the first place and they're almost all upper-middle to high income.  It would fall primarily on the rich,  he said.  Lower and middle income people generally don't have enough money to spend to take the $17,000 in deductions that would get them to the cap.  <paragraph>  Williams also said such a rule would hit hard in high-cost areas where owners of even modest homes can quickly rack up more than $17,000 in home interest, property and state income tax deductions.  It does target people in different geographic areas differently. New York City is going to get killed,  the former Congressional Budget Office staffer said, while adding that wasn't necessarily a reason not to impose such a cap.  <paragraph>  Williams said he thinks the $17,000 figure probably correpsonds to some internal calculation the Romney campaign has made, but not released.  Is there a plan written down somewhere? Because we need to see it....This like saying, 'I have some great dessert for you. Don't pay attention to the broccoli sitting on your plate,  the tax analyst said.
Iran unrest could undercut Romney critique |  <paragraph>  Reports of violent clashes in Iran due to the precipitous drop in value of the country's currency could upset GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's efforts to paint President Barack Obama's Iran policy as ineffectual.  <paragraph>  Tehran's central bazaar was reported to have been closed Wednesday and riot police were patrolling the streets as public and merchant frustration boiled over, apparently directed at economic woes caused by international sanctions intensified by the Obama Administration. At least one protest against Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad Wednesday was broken up by tear gas, news agencies reported.  <paragraph>   Photos showed riot police blocking a street with the charred hulks of a garbage can and a motorcycle that had been set on fire. Smoke was rising from the area in central Tehran near the main bazaar,   <hyperlink> the Associated Press reported. <paragraph>   Hundreds of police in anti-riot gear stormed the currency exchange district of Ferdowsi, arresting illegal money changers and ordering licensed exchange bureaux and other shops closed, witnesses told    <hyperlink> Agence France Presse.  <paragraph>  The Iranian rial's value against the dollar declined by about a third in the past week.  <paragraph>  Romney has argued that he would have moved earlier with tougher sanctions against Tehran.  <paragraph>  The new unrest doesn't indicate that the sanctions are achieving their goal of persuading the Iranians to abandon the nuclear weapons program they insist they're not pursuing. And barring some dramatic change in the coming days, Romney can continue to argue that the administration was slow to embrace tougher sanctions and spent too much time pursuing a rapprochement with Tehran. In addition, scenes of chaos abroad underscore Romney's overall argument that Obama has failed to handle foreign policy capably and that the dangerous world threatens to crash in on the U.S.  <paragraph>  That said, the current clashes and tear gas in the streets are disarming to Romney because they allow Obama to respond to any Iran-related criticism by observing that the sanctions are causing a level of tumult in Iran that could plausibly lead to a change in the nuclear policy.  <paragraph>  Part of the Oct. 16 Obama-Romney debate in New York and all of the Oct. 22 debate in Florida are expected to be devoted to foreign policy issues.
Court extends stop on order blocking indefinite detention law |  <paragraph>  A federal appeals court has extended a temporary stay of a district court judge's order barring the government from using an indefinite detention provision in a defense bill passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama late last year.  <paragraph>  A three-judge motions panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit issued the order Tuesday afternoon, indicating they saw flaws with the scope and rationale for U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Forrest's original order blocking the disputed provision of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2011.  <paragraph>   We conclude that the public interest weighs in favor of granting the government's motion for a stay,  Appeals Court Judges Denny Chin, Raymond Lohier and Christopher Droney wrote in a three-page order that also expedited the appeal.  <paragraph>  The judges continue: “ First, in its memorandum of law in support of its motion, the government clarifies unequivocally that, 'based on their stated activities,' plaintiffs, 'journalists and activists[,] . . . are in no danger whatsoever of ever being captured and detained by the U.S. military.' <paragraph>  Second, on its face, the statute does not affect the existing rights of United States citizens or other individuals arrested in the United States. See NDAA § 1021 e   'Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.' .  <paragraph>  Third, the language of the district court's injunction appears to go beyond NDAA § 1021 itself and to limit the government's authority under the Authorization for Use of Military Force... ”  <paragraph>    <hyperlink> Last month, Lohier alone temporarily blocked Forrest's order, using a so-called administrative stay. <paragraph>  The case will go forward now before what will likely be a different trio of judges, but the stay will likely remain in place pending resolution of the government's appeal. <paragraph>  The import of the law is disputed. Proponents say it simply reinforced authority a federal appeals court in Washington had already accorded to the U.S. government, at least as far as foreigner are concerned. Critics say the measure exposes journalists and human rights activists who meet with alleged terrorists to the prospect of open-ended detention.  <paragraph>  All three judges on the motions panel were appointed to the appeals court by President Barack Obama. <paragraph>  A copy of the panel's order is posted   <hyperlink> here.  <paragraph>  CLARIFICATION  Tuesday, 4:08 P.M : This post has been revised to indicate that Lohier's administrative stay was issued last month.  <paragraph>  CLARIFICATION 2  Tuesday, 5:01 P.M. : This post has been revised to clarify that all three judges were appointed to the appeals court by Obama.
Chicago Protesters: “Take TIFs Off the Menu!” | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Some unusual offerings were on the menu Tuesday at the Chicago restaurant Fulton’s on the River: <PARAGRAPH> “River Point Plaza: A generous portion of useless private space, drizzled with the sweat of working families. Served with a side of your tax dollars.” Price: $29.5 million. <PARAGRAPH> “United Airlines: A flight of public money reserved to shift 350 jobs from the suburbs to downtown.  Despite the $30 million price tag,  peanuts and beverages are not included with this flight.  <PARAGRAPH> The mock menu was handed out by members of the Grassroots Collaborative in protest of public TIF  tax increment financing  money being used to finance private developments. Among those private projects is the new River Point Plaza, to be built on land owned by real estate developer Larry Levy and his family, who preside over a “vast restaurant kingdom” that includes Fulton's. <PARAGRAPH> TIFs are meant to revitalize “blighted” areas and create jobs by allowing a portion of property tax funds to subsidize development. But in Chicago, the program has long been surrounded by scandal. Wealthy areas like the downtown riverfront are designated TIFs, allowing taxpayer funds that otherwise would have gone to parks and schools to be turned over to private developers. <PARAGRAPH> For years, former Mayor Richard M. Daley was accused by tenacious Chicago Reader reporter Ben Joravsky and others of using TIF money as a private piggy bank to reward politically connected developers. Now, in his first year in office, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has continued to leverage TIFs in ways grassroots groups say are unethical and unjust. <PARAGRAPH> Emanuel's  River Point Plaza  will be a $60 million park and tunnel to nearby Union Station, connected to a new “sculptural office tower” developed by real-estate giant Ivanhoe Cambridge. With $29.5 million in TIF money, the city is shouldering half the cost. <PARAGRAPH> Outside Levy’s restaurant, protestors from labor unions and community groups chanted, “Whose money? Our money!” and “Shut down the LaSalle Central TIF,” which covers the area. LaSalle Central TIF money has also been used as an incentive for corporations to move their headquarters there. United Airlines, Willis Holdings–which owns the famous tower formerly known as Sears–and Coors  Miller Lite received millions in taxpayer funds for this purpose, to the tune of $30 million, $3.8 million and $6 million, respectively.  <PARAGRAPH> City officials have argued that developments like River Point Plaza create jobs and improve the economy for people across the socioeconomic spectrum. There are measures in the TIF agreements meant to guarantee jobs and contracts go to a diverse group of Chicago residents. For example, the United Airlines agreement mandates that 50 percent of construction workers be city residents and that a quarter of contractors be minority-owned businesses and 4 percent be women-owned. It stipulates that by phase two of the project, the headquarters must relocate at least 2,500 employees to the city and bring in another 2,500 external employees. <PARAGRAPH> But critics aren’t buying it. <PARAGRAPH> “There’s all this focus on downtown with the idea that it will trickle down to the neighborhoods--but in fact it’s mostly making it harder for the neighborhoods,” Grassroots Collaborative executive director Amisha Patel told In These Times. The Collaborative’s members include the Chicago Teachers Union, SEIU Local 73, Action Now and the Organization of the Northeast  ONE . “The mayor talks about bringing all these jobs downtown, but often they are jobs that already had workers, just moving downtown from the suburbs.  <PARAGRAPH> She adds:  One of the biggest sources of quality jobs [for lower-income and minority residents] is the public sector, but we’re closing mental health clinics [and] schools.  <PARAGRAPH> Many Teachers Union members take the diversion of property tax dollars especially personally since the city’s schools are desperately underfunded. The teachers have spent the past year in bitter public battles and highly polarized contract negotiations with Mayor Emanuel and the school board. They say it is ironic that the city can funnel to private developers many millions of dollars that otherwise could have gone to schools; yet money cannot be found to revamp struggling schools slated for closing, or to pay teachers what an independent arbiter said they deserve for a longer school day mandated by Emanuel. <PARAGRAPH> “They’re destabilizing our schools and using our black and brown children as pawns,” said CTU member Sherrie Parker, who had taught at Guggenheim Elementary, one of the schools that was controversially closed. “TIF money is our money. It should go to education, not to  owners of  fancy restaurants.” <PARAGRAPH> The protestors handed out the satirical menus and waved signs at diners and at the Chicago water taxis that pulled up along the dock for a closer look  before being told to leave by the restaurant . They chanted: “We’re hungry, we’re broke, we can’t pay the rent. We must not be part of the 1 percent!” <PARAGRAPH> Protest participant Sijisfredo Aviles said he’s seen TIF money used appropriately in his neighborhood of Humboldt Park, a mostly Puerto Rican area on the city’s west side. Affordable housing was created there with the help of TIF dollars, providing homes for vulnerable people and creating jobs for local residents. <PARAGRAPH> “The idea with TIFs was to create jobs and stabilize communities,” said Aviles, who was laid off from his job in substance abuse counseling for youth because of state budget cuts. “We don’t need to stabilize downtown…This is an excuse to siphon off money that should have gone to park districts and give it to investors. It’s a rip-off.” <PARAGRAPH> Protest participant Danielle Kenny with the group Action Now said a “gentleman” walked past her and said, “Why don’t you just find a job?” <PARAGRAPH> “Well that’s exactly what I’m trying to do!” she said. “Silly man.” 
NLRB Rules In Favor of Chicago’s Columbia College Professors | <PARAGRAPH> Unionized part-time faculty at Columbia College in Chicago gained a major victory, union leaders say, when the National Labor Relations Board  NLRB  issued a ruling about the way classes are assigned and the administration’s failure to turn over requested documents that shed light on the process. <PARAGRAPH> In years past, experienced part-time faculty at the arts and media-focused college in downtown Chicago typically could expect to teach the same classes year after year, in a process known as “rollover.” But around 2010, according to P-fac  Part-Time Faculty Association at Columbia College  President Diana Vallera, senior part-time faculty were not being assigned to expected classes, often finding them given to newly hired part-timers. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> “If you’ve been there some time you have certain expectations of income, and you rely on that income,” Vallera says. “It was devastating for a lot of our members—especially since those classes were still available.” <PARAGRAPH> This is among several issues being debated in contentious negotiations stretching since the union’s last four-year contract expired in 2010, and was indefinitely extended. For eight months, according to the union, administrators have refused to meet with them, so bargaining has been at a stalemate. <PARAGRAPH> On July 17 NLRB administrative law judge Robert A. Ringler ruled in favor of the union on unfair labor practice charges related to the rollovers and documents requested by the union to analyze how the school was assigning classes. The NLRB found that the actual class assignment policy was not an issue that could be covered by bargaining, but the impact of the change on union members is subject to bargaining. The judge also said the administration must turn over the documents the union requested. <PARAGRAPH> Columbia College declined to respond to specific questions for this story, and sent a statement: <PARAGRAPH> We strongly disagree with the Administrative Law Judge’s decision and will continue to make those objections through the appropriate processes. Columbia has always engaged in good faith bargaining and will continue to do so. Our focus remains on the educational and financial well-being of our students, along with the vitality and quality of the College itself. <PARAGRAPH> Vallera says the hiring of new part-time teachers instead of senior adjuncts is unfair to students as well as teachers. <PARAGRAPH> “These are faculty with lots of experience,” she says. “This is about not valuing their faculty, but it’s also about what’s best for students and student learning.” <PARAGRAPH> Vallera says it is unclear exactly why the administration is replacing senior instructors with newer ones or administrators—“we’re seeing deans teaching classes.” It is likely a cost-saving measure and possibly also a move to reduce the union’s power as the contract negotiations drag on. <PARAGRAPH> “Maybe they’re trying to negatively affect the membership by having our senior members losing classes, but if so that backfired because senior members were upset and came to the union and got involved,” Vallera says. <PARAGRAPH> Vallera hopes the decision will mean renewed negotiations between the college and the part-timers union, which has about 900 members. She says school officials have offered to meet with the union every three weeks for two hours, but union leaders don’t think that is sufficient given that past negotiations were held for at least three hours every week. <PARAGRAPH> “I think this kind of decision is a step in the right direction and has gotten people involved in bargaining,” Vallera says. “Hopefully they will bargain in good faith at this point, not just on the effects of these changes because they’re forced to but also on the contract. Hopefully we won’t have to take further action on that.” <PARAGRAPH> Judge Ringler chided the administration for failing to turn over documents and information requested by the union in December 2010, including lists of adjuncts whose classes were canceled and reasons for class assignment switches.  <PARAGRAPH> The ruling says: <PARAGRAPH> In addition to an employer's duty to provide necessary and relevant information, “an unreasonable delay in furnishing such information is as much a violation of the Act as a refusal to furnish the information at all. <PARAGRAPH> The NLRB also ordered 18 part-timers with classes canceled must be paid the equivalent of a three-credit course, with interest, about $4,700. The ruling said: <PARAGRAPH> Meaningful bargaining cannot be assured until some measure of economic strength is restored to the Union; a bargaining order alone, therefore, cannot serve as an adequate remedy for the unfair labor practices committed.
Global Hyatt Boycott Heats Up | <PARAGRAPH> On July 23 unions and other labor and community groups called for a global boycott of Hyatt hotels, citing problematic working conditions and employment practices that they say violate labor laws and workers’ rights. The boycott is part of the Hyatt Hurts campaign centered around housekeepers, who suffer high rates of  injury and often make around minimum wage working for contractors with few or no benefits.  Indianapolis hotel cleaner Elvia Bahena, fired last week after speaking out at a community hearing, is just one of the workers who say they’ve been mistreated and retaliated against by Hyatt or its contractors. <PARAGRAPH> Bahena had worked for United Services Co., a company that contracts with Hyatt hotels to provide cleaners. On average, cleaners work on 24 rooms a day, with the contractor of course taking a cut of what Hyatt pays for their services. Hyatt and other Indianapolis hotels and contractors allegedly conspired to protect this system through a “black-listing” arrangement wherein the contract workers would not be directly hired by hotels even when direct-hire jobs became available. UNITE HERE says the blacklisting kept about 1,000 local workers trapped in minimum-wage jobs with no hope of advancement. Bahena made $8 an hour after 11 years in the industry. She previously worked at the Westin and Marriott hotels, where she also worked for a contractor. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> On July 16 the Indianapolis city council passed an ordinance outlawing the blacklisting practice. Bahena had spoken in favor of the ordinance at a community hearing where top hotel managers were present, and two weeks later she was fired. <PARAGRAPH> United Services later said Bahena was fired for performance issues and missing work, but UNITE HERE Indianapolis organizer Sarah Lyons says Bahena, 36, had only missed one day of work, when her son was sick, and had never been written up for performance reasons. <PARAGRAPH> “My three kids are all about to go back to school, there are a lot of supplies and uniforms to purchase, and I’m afraid I won’t be able to pay the rent,” Bahena says. <PARAGRAPH> Lyons says United Services has started “backpedaling,” saying Bahena is still on their roster, a sign local pressure around her case is having an effect. Bahena says she would rather work directly for the Hyatt, “for the benefits, to make a little more money and have real raises.” <PARAGRAPH> “The  direct-hire  hotel jobs tend to pay $1 or $2 more an hour – they’re not great jobs, but they do pay a little more at least,” Lyons says. <PARAGRAPH> Hyatt workers and their supporters held demonstrations across the country last week around the boycott announcement. In many cities there have been boycotts and one-day strikes at Hyatts for several years, including at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, which houses a unionized Hyatt hotel. Last summer the Hyatt Park Hotel in Chicago turned on heat lamps over striking workers on a sweltering June day, a move hotel managers said was a mistake and workers said was an intimidation tactic. <PARAGRAPH> The global boycott coincides with a social media campaign to vote Hyatt the “worst hotel employer in America.”  In addition to being supported by the AFL-CIO and Change to Win coalition, the boycott and social media campaign are also backed by the NFL Players Association—whose members presumably have stayed in countless hotels during their careers—and other groups, including the National Organization of Women, MoveOn.org, Netroots Nation, American Rights at Work, the Courage Campaign, the United Farm Workers, Making Change at Walmart and the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs. <PARAGRAPH> Regarding the NFL Players’ support, the Hyatt Hurts website notes: <PARAGRAPH> [NFL Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice] Smith emphasized that NFL players know what it’s like to work in pain, and that they recently faced their own “speedup” when the owners wanted them to play an extra two games per season. He noted that only by joining together were the players able to defeat the owners’ proposal: “We’ve learned the same lessons that these housekeepers know. That if they stick together and fight for what’s right, they have a chance. If they try to fight by themselves, if they let a corporation divide them, it will be worse for everyone.” <PARAGRAPH> About 30 percent of Hyatts in major markets are unionized, according to UNITE HERE, compared to about 40 percent of Hilton and Starwood hotels. As relationships with the company have deteriorated, most of the unionized Hyatt workers have been working without a contract for up to three years. Lyons says that Starwood and Hilton have offered thousands of their workers “a fair process to unionize” recently, whereas Hyatt has “allowed only about 500 workers that right.” <PARAGRAPH> Indianapolis is the largest U.S. city without a union hotel, according to UNITE HERE. The boycott does not include two Hawaii Hyatts that have contracts with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union  ILWU  and a number of Hyatts with UNITE HERE contracts. <PARAGRAPH> The use of increasing use of contractors has dovetailed with increasing workloads for cleaners, increasing their risk of injuries and attracting the attention of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration. <PARAGRAPH> “The worst days are Sundays and Mondays when people have just checked out and the rooms are really messy,” says Bahena, who is also a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in January against Hyatt, other Indianapolis hotels and the contractor Hospitality Staffing Solutions.  “After a Sunday, I feel really, really tired. After a long day my feet and my knees hurt.” <PARAGRAPH> UNITE HERE says that Hyatt’s practices are particularly harmful to women, who make up a majority of the cleaning workforce and allege they are often retaliated against and discriminated against. Ten thousand people worldwide have signed a petition in support of two Santa Clara Hyatt cleaners who were fired after they complained about digitally altered photos of them in bikinis posted on a hotel bulletin board. <PARAGRAPH> Academics in gender and women’s studies  and other fields  wrote a letter casting this incident in the context of widespread abuses of women workers at Hyatt hotels, saying: <PARAGRAPH> The sexualization of housekeepers by Hyatt management is an appalling expression of power that has no place at work. It has tangible physical as well as psychological impacts. It belongs to a long list of well-documented abusive and unsafe practices that Hyatt housekeepers, many of them women of color, all over the country endure. <PARAGRAPH> Cathy Youngblood, a 61-year-old housekeeper at the Hyatt Andraz on the Sunset Strip, sees the working conditions of housekeepers as a clear-cut women’s rights issue.  Click here to learn more about Youngblood and other Hyatt workers.  <PARAGRAPH> “The way Hyatt treats its women housekeepers is like an unidentified, unspoken attack on women, immigrants, and minorities,” Youngblood says. “I came through the Civil Rights era—that taught me how to speak up, especially when I think a workforce is being abused. Hyatt doesn’t like the word abuse, but that is what they are doing to women, immigrants and minorities.”
Hyatt Worker Cathy Youngblood: We’re Not Going To Stop “Until We Get What We Need” | <PARAGRAPH> Cathy Youngblood refers to herself as a “late bloomer.” She got two associate degrees earlier in life, but went back to school and obtained two bachelors degrees in Anthropology and African Studies in her late 50s. She graduated just as the economy was collapsing, however, and her dreams of finding work in her fields were dashed. She got a retail job but when her hours were cut to four per week it became unsustainable. <PARAGRAPH> A friend told her about an open house for jobs in the hospitality industry, sponsored by Hyatt Hotels and the UNITE HERE union, which is now calling for a global boycott of Hyatts as part of its Hyatt Hurts campaign. <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood says she found out the hotel chain was looking for more “diversity” in its workforce, and as an African-American woman she was covered. She went to a one week “boot camp” connected to the initiative, and then was hired as a housekeeper at the Andaz West Hollywood on the Sunset Strip just as her unemployment benefits were running out. She noted that many people don’t realize the chain of Andaz “boutique luxury” hotels around the country are actually owned by Hyatt. With 239 rooms and about 33 housekeepers, the Andaz West Hollywood is smaller than most of the Hyatt hotels. <PARAGRAPH> It didn’t take long for Youngblood, 61, to become disillusioned with the work. Not surprisingly it was physically taxing, cleaning 13 rooms a day at a fast pace and lifting heavy mattresses because the hotel chain has resisted buying fitted sheets which could make the job much easier. <PARAGRAPH> But it wasn’t the physical hardship that upset Youngblood most. Rather it was the way she thought the company treated its workers, particularly the immigrant women who make up a large portion of the housecleaning staff. She says she got the impression the hotel chain had avoided hiring African-American workers because managers figured immigrants would be a more “docile” workforce. <PARAGRAPH> “Most black people in this country will speak up on the job because they’re citizens and know their rights, they know the labor laws and what they mean,” she says. <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood wasn’t afraid to speak out, and neither were many of her immigrant coworkers. Workers at their hotel are among the roughly 30 percent of Hyatts where housekeepers belong to the UNITE HERE union; many of them have been working without a contract for three years. At non-union Hyatts, Youngblood and other workers and union staff say, workers are expected to clean more rooms per day, as many as 40. <PARAGRAPH> One day in March 2011 at the Andaz West Hollywood, workers were ordered to clean 15 rooms a day, two more than previously. But they wouldn’t take it. <PARAGRAPH> “We protested, we voiced our opinions, we marched up to the general manager’s office single file to show solidarity,” Youngblood says. “One of the people from HR came out and said if we didn’t go back to work and do what we were told we might face severe discipline, including  termination. We didn’t like that, but we went back to work that day because we didn’t want to be fired.” <PARAGRAPH> They filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, which resulted this January in a settlement in the workers’ favor leading to a 13-room cap and other protections reinstated from their expired contract. <PARAGRAPH> “It was really quite a feat for 30 women to go to the Hyatt and manage to get them to lower the room count, ” Youngblood says. “It sent a strong message to Hyatt, it scared them. That’s monumental.” <PARAGRAPH> If management were cowed by that experience, they likely did not know what else was in store. On July 23 UNITE HERE and other labor, community and interfaith groups – including the NFL Players Association -- called  for the global boycott of Hyatt hotels until they improve their labor practices. Youngblood thinks “the timing is right,” and notes that Hyatt workers in the United States already were communicating and organizing with Hyatt workers in India, Israel and the Philippines even before the global boycott. <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood hopes the international attention will persuade Hyatt higher-ups to meet with regular workers. <PARAGRAPH> “I would love to have a meeting with  Hyatt family heir, board member and Chicago philanthropist  Penny Pritzker, but then I’m a woman of color and I’m lower wage, maybe she thinks I don’t have enough education,” says Youngblood. “They’re a billionaire company, they have a different mindset. I think it’s ignorant. They should know by now there is worker dissatisfaction within the Hyatt family. They could get on a plane and come in here and say ‘Ok ladies, what’s going on?’ But instead they just talk about all their awards and accolades and diversity, and don’t want to hear the real story.” <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood says the solutions to many of their problems are not complicated—for example, buying fitted sheets and a wider range of cleaning equipment with shorter or longer handles appropriate for workers of different heights. <PARAGRAPH> “The tools are out there on the market – it’s not like you have to go out and invent them. But maybe some of the tools are more expensive than others.” <PARAGRAPH> She says most guests don’t realize how taxing it is to make a hotel bed lifting the 100-pound-plus mattress to tuck in flat sheets. “It’s not like making your bed at home. When you’re done with your sixth room your back is out of whack.” <PARAGRAPH>  Youngblood notes that the work has a mental impact along with the physical effects: <PARAGRAPH> “Like the other workers I do pride myself on how well we do our work, how clean a room is,” Youngblood says. “And there are inspections. Because you have to go so fast, you pray you won’t forget to leave soap or do something in the room. You’re working at such an incredible fast pace, it takes an emotional toll. When you consistently have to rush rush rush, it has a psychological effect.” <PARAGRAPH> Youngblood says hotel managers seem surprised that she is working as a housekeeper given her educational achievements and goals. She usually doesn’t tell them that she is now planning to get a doctorate in women’s studies, with her experience at the Hyatt, and her interviews with fellow workers, as the centerpiece of her thesis. But aside from the “field work” she is able to do related to her job, Youngblood is determined to stick with this fight until the end. <PARAGRAPH> “If I quit who’s going to take my place, another woman? And then the problem of abuse on the job will not be solved. I think if you can get through this life and make it a little easier for your children and grandchildren and other women and men coming behind you…I in all good conscience just can’t quit because of the way other women have shown love toward me. I do not want to leave housekeeping until we get what we need. I’m talking worldwide. I don’t want any housekeeper to suffer like we have suffered.”
Making Health Care Reform Work: A Perspective from California Doctors | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> LOS ANGELES—At a conference convened by the organization Reporting on Health at the University of Southern California this week, doctors and health care experts shed light on labor-related aspects of the health care field as the sweeping health care reform legislation is set to take effect after being upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. <PARAGRAPH> They provided a window into the workplace stresses and challenges doctors themselves have faced in our tumultuous and trouble-plagued health care system, and also the health care needs and challenges of low-income workers. <PARAGRAPH> Marcia Sablan, a doctor in the tiny northern California town of Firebaugh, embodies both of these narratives. Marcia is one of many doctors who depended on a federal program that helps people afford medical school in exchange for working in under-served rural districts. After her residency at the University of Hawaii, she was assigned to Firebaugh, in the agricultural valley of Fresno County, with a population then of just over 3,000. She was accompanied by her husband, also a doctor and the first native of Saipan to graduate from a U.S. medical school. <PARAGRAPH> Panelists at the conference noted that such programs will be increasingly important if the government wants to encourage more doctors to go into general primary care rather than becoming specialists. Specialists make an estimated $3.5 million more over their lifetimes, yet there will be an estimated shortage of 30,000 primary care doctors in coming years especially as more people become insured under the new health care law. <PARAGRAPH> Sablan arrived in Firebaugh in 1981 and eventually founded her own private practice there, where she primarily serves low-income Latino farmworkers, about half of them immigrants, including many uninsured people who may or may not end up insured under the health care bill reforms. Doctors and experts at the USC conference echoed the widespread concern that due to the way the health care reform bill and Supreme Court decision played out, people living under the poverty line may not get insurance under the new law. That’s because the insurance exchanges and subsidies the law mandates are designated for people who make more than the poverty line, while people making below the poverty line  including childless adults —a change from the past  are all supposed to be covered by Medicaid. <PARAGRAPH> States are ordered to expand their Medicaid programs to cover people making up to 133 percent of the poverty line, but the mandate doesn't have strong teeth since it is unclear if or how the federal government can punish states that don't expand their Medicaid programs to cover the newly eligible people. Many states say they cannot afford their share of the expansion plus the extra costs expected when currently eligible but un-enrolled people “come out of the woodwork” thanks to the publicity around the reform law. <PARAGRAPH> Sablan notes that she never asks her patients about immigration status—she is not required to under California’s Medicaid law—and she typically charges a $50 fee which most patients pay out of pocket. <PARAGRAPH> “Undocumented workers know not to leave a trail, not to leave bills,” she said. <PARAGRAPH> But when her patients need specialty care, the seasonal nature of farm work can cause serious problems. Many of them do have insurance during the months they are employed, but not during the off-months, she said. In her early years in Firebaugh, many of the locals were migrant workers living in labor camps who returned to Mexico or otherwise left Firebaugh for half the year. But the labor camps have been demolished and now many farmworkers have bought homes and live year-round in the town with their families, even as they continue to depend on seasonal agricultural wages. Hence an illness or injury that keeps them away from work for days or weeks during the crucial seasonal employment period is especially devastating financially. <PARAGRAPH> “What does an agricultural-based seasonal economy mean to a doctor practicing there?” Sablan asked, noting that Firebaugh’s population now numbers 6,741: 88 percent Latino, 22 percent living below the poverty line, more than a third unemployed and almost two-thirds without a high school diploma. “It means people have insurance and Medi-Cal  California’s version of Medicaid  at certain seasons of the year. But we know diseases don’t work like that. So this is a huge problem for us—seasonal workers have a very difficult time keeping up with chronic diseases.” <PARAGRAPH> From a health perspective, Sablan is glad to see the valley’s once-thriving cotton industry decline, she said, since it involves heavy pesticide use that raised serious health problems for workers and other residents. Once she treated victims of what was known as the worst pesticide-poisoning case in state history—28 workers critically poisoned after being ordered to return to a field too soon after it had been sprayed with phosphates. Now almonds and pistachios are the main crops in the area, grown mostly by huge industrial farms.  Meanwhile a sustainable cotton project has been in the works.  <PARAGRAPH> Sablan hopes the health care reform law will indeed result in better preventative care for low-income and currently uninsured people. She cites the case of one patient, a 54-year-old farmworker who had a heart attack and was prescribed medication which, at $400 a week, he could never afford. Also suffering from diabetes and lacking medication, he eventually had another heart attack and ending up needing permanent dialysis by age 60. <PARAGRAPH> “When you think about the Obama plan, think about [the farmworker] – do we want to be upstream or downstream?” in health care spending, she asked. “Someone paid for him to be in the hospital two times and on dialysis, which costs about a million dollars a year. He’s totally disabled now, unable to work, from what should have been a preventable situation.” <PARAGRAPH> Despite such challenges, Sablan and her husband feel lucky to work in an environment where they have treated three generations of patients —it gives them a sense of personal connection and continuity that other doctors say they lack when forced to see up to 30 patients a day, in the common “fee for service” health care model. <PARAGRAPH> Dr. Ken Kim described the challenges of working in a typical profit-driven, urban system. He and other internists were disgusted to see how badly many of their patients were faring under the standard health care model. He described multiple diabetic patients with legs amputated because they were shuffled between specialists, waiting for months for appointments, while a “pin-sized” wound became infected and festered. And he described elderly patients unable to comply with a doctor’s orders because they lacked a ride to the clinic or couldn’t open medicine bottles with arthritic hands or ate high-sodium meals as shut-ins. Doctors and nurses want to help such patients with personalized care, he indicated, but the fee-for-service model and other aspects of the traditional insurance system create so much time pressure that patients fall through the cracks. <PARAGRAPH> So Kim and other doctors formed an “accountable care organization”  ACO  wherein insurance companies like Blue Cross pay the organization a flat fee to provide care for a certain group of the insurance companies’ enrollees. Kim said that after floundering at first, the company, CareMore, where he now serves as chief medical officer, was able to provide holistic, preventative care to a patient base of mostly ailing senior citizens by subverting the fee for service model, focusing on prevention and making sure the various nurses and doctors working with a given patient communicate and develop a cohesive plan. He said that under their organization rates of hospital readmissions, amputations, mortality and other indicators have decreased drastically. Many hope this type of accountable care organization will become more common under the health reform law. <PARAGRAPH> While the general public is obviously confused about the implications of the health care reform bill, doctors and health care experts are also uncertain about how the law will play out and what it will mean for their own work lives and those of their patients.
Going Undercover to Determine the Real Price of Sex | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Jenea often still feels the same way she did when she was being held captive in Turkey and forced to have sex with up to 50 men a day, after having left her small Bulgarian village in hopes of a job abroad. <PARAGRAPH> “It would have been better for me not to be born,” she says. She tried to escape by climbing out a window and down a pipe, but took a serious fall and blacked out. Her captors forced her to continue working even as she was partially paralyzed and unable to feel what was being done to her. Finally they let her call her sister Natalia, who came to get her. But Natalia was told that Jenea still owed $450 for travel and living expenses, and they forced Natalia to work as a prostitute for a month to pay off the debt. <PARAGRAPH> Jenea and Natalia are among the Eastern European women featured in photojournalist and filmmaker Mimi Chakarova’s 2011 documentary The Price of Sex  which is accompanied by an excellent multimedia series available free online . Global sex trafficking has been the subject of many investigative stories, documentaries and reports; it is not a crisis that lacks attention. But still, Chakarova’s work stands out from the other admirable and also not-so-admirable efforts to document this shadowy world. <PARAGRAPH> This is due in part to Chakarova’s personal connection to the issue. She left Bulgaria as a young child with her family, as the economy collapsed with the fall of the Iron Curtain, but she found upon return visits that girls from her own village had ended up disappearing—literally—into trafficking networks. She feels like that fate could easily have been her own. As she said during a recent rebroadcast of a “Snap Judgment” piece on National Public Radio, she was disgusted by sensational media images of trafficked Eastern European women wearing lingerie and heavy makeup because she thought that these images—often shot by men— dehumanized the women and contributed to stereotypes. She pursued her own work on the topic with intense passion, courage and dedication; she even went undercover as a trafficked women, working with complicit men and women she met through survivors’ networks, and in doing so risked actually being “sold”  in which case she figured she might kill herself . <PARAGRAPH> I haven’t actually seen the documentary The Price of Sex, which won several high-profile awards at film festivals last year, but after hearing Chakarova’s radio interview and viewing the lengthy multi-media piece, I felt anyone interested in labor issues should be aware of her work. <PARAGRAPH> Chakarova delves into each woman’s individual story with gently probing and empathetic questions, while also explaining the larger socioeconomic context of the problem, beginning with the simple economic inequities between countries—in this case a direct result of the fall of Communism. <PARAGRAPH> Martin Wyss, chief of Mission International Organization for Migration in Moldova, told her: <PARAGRAPH> It wasn’t just that there wasn’t any money left or infrastructure…there was severe corruption, and these circumstances destroyed the social fabric. Families were ripped apart, alcoholism increased, suicides went up, life expectancies were reduced, migration…created a lot of victims. Many people were left behind, many were left to their own devices. For all intents and purposes there was anarchy…Those who were already weaker would be taken advantage of. <PARAGRAPH> Chakarova notes that most women are recruited by neighbors or acquaintances, or even their own siblings or parents. The recruiters and the women themselves may or may not know the type of work —unpaid slavery, more accurately—that lies in store for them. She says it’s a complicated question, with no simple answer. Wyss adds: <PARAGRAPH> If you make $50 a month and you have a sick mother and the father is dead and the younger brother has to go to school and you are accumulating debts to pay for the treatment of your mother, you have to do something…men start to steal, women may resort to prostitution. <PARAGRAPH> As Ion Vizdoga, an NGO attorney fighting trafficking, told Chakarova in an interview,  When in a village of 2,000 only 50 people have jobs, young people have two choices: Commit crimes to survive, or leave the country and risk being trafficked.” <PARAGRAPH> Sex workers and advocates frequently complain—rightly—that sex workers in general and trafficked women specifically are too often portrayed by media and aid organizations as passive victims. But while Chakarova shows that trafficked women are victimized horrifically by individual men, organized crime groups and larger social and economic systems, she also shows their strength in surviving not only the trafficking, but also the grueling daily life—the experience of being a poor woman in a poor country—that awaits those who do escape. <PARAGRAPH> One of the most heart-breaking aspects of Chakarova’s reporting is the current situation of the women who have escaped trafficking, many of whom find themselves trapped in lives of poverty and deprivation. These survivors are often jobless and suffering permanent health effects, severe psychological trauma and disabilities caused by the trafficking; furthermore, they are often stigmatized by their villages and families. Given the abundance of NGO, governmental and media attention paid to trafficking, one would hope that these women would be offered some economic opportunities and resources after all they’ve been through; the fact they are not reflects the dire economic situation in these countries, especially in rural areas, and illustrates why they continue to be such fertile ground for traffickers even as the horror stories filter out. <PARAGRAPH> Though The Price of Sex focuses on Eastern European women trafficked within Europe and the Middle East, in the accompanying multimedia piece Chakarova also quotes a former FBI agent who notes the responsibility of the U.S. in global trafficking, in terms of both the trafficking that occurs here and the participation of U.S. citizens in sex tourism abroad. That’s not to mention the role of U.S. policy and U.S. corporations in a global economy that is based on low-paid work and migration. <PARAGRAPH> Chakarova also explores the depressing fact that much of the money going to fight trafficking in Eastern Europe gets absorbed by state agencies who then are motivated to make it appear they are exposing trafficking cases; in reality, little or none of the money goes to the rural impoverished villages, either to help alleviate the situations that facilitate trafficking or to aid the victims. <PARAGRAPH> Ana Revenco, founder of the sex trafficking escape hotline La Strada, said: <PARAGRAPH> It’s the big discrepancy between poor countries and rich countries, the big discrepancy in access to justice, high levels of corruption…Unless you address these issues, all these hotlines will not solve the situation.
Complaint Filed Against California Walmart Warehouse | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> Workers stacking heavy boxes and driving forklifts in the dark. <PARAGRAPH> Thick black dust that causes nosebleeds and vomiting. <PARAGRAPH> Broken hand carts that give workers the choice between carrying heavy boxes by hand or struggling with carts so slow that they could be fired for not meeting strict piecework quotas. <PARAGRAPH> Emergency exits blocked by stacks of boxes and pallets. <PARAGRAPH> Workers stuck in stifling trailers for up to 30 minutes after heavy loaded pallets are stacked in front of the doors. <PARAGRAPH> Filthy bathrooms and water fountains, and no time to fill up water bottles while working in 95-degree temperatures. <PARAGRAPH> These are among the conditions documented at an Eastvale, California Walmart warehouse and outlined in a formal complaint filed with the California Department of Occupational Safety and Health on July 18 by the group Warehouse Workers United  WWU . <PARAGRAPH> The complaint demands a “wall-to-wall on-site inspection” of the warehouse, which is run by the same company—National Distribution Centers of Delaware, Inc.—that operates the four California warehouses charged with scores of serious health and safety violations and fined $256,000 by the state in January 2012. <PARAGRAPH> The violations and workplace policies described at the Eastvale warehouse are very similar to problems described at the other Walmart warehouses. <PARAGRAPH> “We’ve talked to hundreds of workers and inevitably the Walmart warehouses have the same types of working conditions—problems around wage and hour, health and safety violations and ongoing pressure to lower costs,” WWU organizer Guadalupe Palma told Working In These Times. “Inevitably that gets pushed down onto the workers. These warehouses are trying to keep up with what Walmart is asking for just to compete in the industry.” <PARAGRAPH> The complaint notes a July 12 incident involving worker Apolniar Rojas, who was seriously injured as he was backing a forklift out of a shipping container and the ramp he was backing onto slipped away. A passing manager told him not to go to the office until he had finished his job, according to the complaint, and then he was told to go to a Concentra Urgent Care Clinic affiliated with the warehouse 2.5 miles away. He had no car and could not find a ride on his own, so he walked in pain to the clinic, where he was diagnosed with a lumbar sprain, strained neck and shoulder sprain. <PARAGRAPH> The complaint notes that workers are regularly sent home after injuries without being told of their rights to be examined and covered under workers compensation laws. It says workers are told they will be laid off if “they cannot be counted on” to work with an injury. It also says workers are forced to drive forklifts and trucks without the proper training, and cites one worker—Miguel Gonzalez—who was seriously injured and then suspended for three days after a supervisor ordered him to drive a forklift without training. The complaint also notes that speed limits on forklifts are not enforced, and workers are forced to drive them dangerously at top speed or risk demotion. <PARAGRAPH> Like Gonzalez, many workers apparently find themselves in catch 22 situations. Palma said: <PARAGRAPH> There’s definitely a lot of pressure that gets placed from Walmart to move more boxes at higher rates of speed, and that leads to injuries. It’s not sustainable for a worker to continue to work at that pace without getting injured. Whether they report the injury or not, there’s retaliation. If they don’t report the injury they’ll try to keep up but they could be terminated or retaliated against if they’re not keeping up with the pace. And by continuing to work, they exacerbate the injury. If they do report the injury, there’s also retaliation and they often don’t get adequate medical care. <PARAGRAPH> The complaint also notes that workers are forced to pay for safety equipment out of pocket, with a photo of a price list showing $5 for a safety vest, $11 for an extra large vest, $4 for gloves and even $1 for four pens. The document includes many photos of obviously broken—even mangled—handcarts, ramps and other equipment. <PARAGRAPH> The Eastvale warehouse does not actually store goods on site, but rather receives them by truck from the ports of L.A. and Los Angeles and redistributes them for shipping to Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. About 60 workers are on duty at a time at the 24-hour facility, with most of them loading and unloading boxes and some driving forklifts and tractors, the complaint notes. Like most warehouses, it involves a complicated ownership and staffing structure. Industry critics note that such structures allow major companies like Walmart to avoid responsibility for the working conditions and pay rates in their warehouses, and facilitate a heavy reliance on temporary staffing without job stability or benefits. <PARAGRAPH> The complaint is on behalf of 17 specific workers, 16 of whom are referred to as “joint Employees” of Walmart Stores, Inc., National Distribution Centers of Delaware, and staffing companies SCI Companies Inc., Warestaff, LLC and Select Staffing. Offering a glimpse of the tangled structure, it says: <PARAGRAPH> Both Warestaff and NFI managers often tell floor workers to move faster and punish workers for not meeting their quotas. NFI appears to be responsible for the maintenance of the facility, industrial trucks and other equipment. The property itself is owned by Swift. Workers who report injuries are given workers’ compensation forms labeled with the name SCI Companies, a Professional Employer Association, a subsidiary of which, PEO Management Group of Lawrenceville, GA, is also named on workers’ paychecks. At the same time, a Walmart Manager has been witnessed talking to the managers and workers about the facility’s production. <PARAGRAPH> Last month WWU caught an employee of a high-powered public relations firm posing as a college student and a reporter to infiltrate the group. The company, Mercury Public Affairs, advertises itself as specializing in “Latino Communications.” <PARAGRAPH> “That was pretty outrageous but unfortunately it’s not surprising,” said Palma. “We know that Walmart plays dirty.”
New York Cabbies Celebrate | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> NEW YORK CITY – “It’s about time,” said a New York City cab driver while weaving efficiently through afternoon traffic in Midtown on Monday. It had been several days since the New York Taxi Workers Alliance logged a major victory with a commission vote that grants drivers a 17 percent fare hike and what the group is calling the first ever Health and Disability Fund for drivers, paid for through a surcharge on every ride. The ordinance also ends the 5 percent loss that drivers previously absorbed every time a passenger used a credit card. <PARAGRAPH> On July 12 the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission voted 6-2  with one abstention  to adopt the fare hike and other measures, which were backed by Mayor Michael M. Bloomberg, many city councilmen and organized labor allies of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents about a third of the city’s 48,500 drivers. <PARAGRAPH> The driver, an immigrant who declined to give his name, did not seem overly enthusiastic about the vote, noting that driving will still be a grueling profession where he expects rising gas prices to continue to make things difficult. He did not think the higher fares would result in any fewer people taking cabs in New York City, where cabs are of course ubiquitous and absolutely central to daily business and social life. Especially in Lower Manhattan, where relatively few people have cars, cabs make up a huge percentage of the vehicles on the street, and the threat of a cab drivers strike carries much weight. <PARAGRAPH> The New York Taxi Workers Alliance framed the commission vote as an historic “David vs. Goliath” victory, noting that they were up against powerful owners of large taxi companies, who under this plan don’t get a proportional share of the increased income drivers are likely to earn. <PARAGRAPH> The New York Times quoted a spokesman for the Metropolitan New York Taxicab Board of Trade who said the group might take legal action to overturn the fare hike. The Board, which represents 33 of the fleet garages that employ the majority of the city’s drivers, had previously sought a 20 percent fare increase, but only if the lease cap that fleet owners can charge drivers was also raised 20 percent. <PARAGRAPH> The Taxi Workers Alliance website says: <PARAGRAPH> Our better tomorrow was ultimately won because of the organizing and sacrifices of our membership who packed the hearing rooms, participated in studies, raised public consciousness and refused to give up the pursuit for justice. Hearing after hearing after protest after press conference after general meeting, NYTWA members stood strong, resilient, had the courage to negotiate and withstood intimidation and relentlessness from powerful opponents. <PARAGRAPH> Fleet owners have charged that political retaliation, rather than concern for drivers’ well-being, motivated the mayor’s and other elected officials’ support of the fare increase. The taxi industry had successfully blocked Bloomberg’s attempt to demand livery drivers that serve far-flung parts of the city be licensed to pick up people hailing them on the street. <PARAGRAPH> Currently people must call for such livery cabs. Requiring new medallions for up to 18,000 of these cabs could have generated $1 billion a year in revenue, according to the mayor’s office, with 20 percent of the vehicles required to be wheelchair-accessible.  The state legislature had approved Bloomberg’s plan last fall as a statewide matter after city council shot it down. But in response to lawsuits from the taxicab board, a state Supreme Court justice ruled the city council does have jurisdiction over the issue, and negated the state legislation. <PARAGRAPH> Many yellow cab drivers, along with fleet owners, were opposed to the livery street-hail licenses, arguing it would cut into their business and decrease the value of medallions held by driver-owners. The New York Times noted that it could also hurt retired drivers who lease their medallions to help make ends meet, including for covering healthcare expenses. <PARAGRAPH> The yellow cab fare increase means the cost of rides to the city’s airports could rise notably, from about $45 to $52 for a ride from Manhattan to JFK International Airport. Several New Yorkers waiting for the private Airporter bus from Manhattan to LaGuardia on Tuesday said they regularly debate whether to take the $12.50 bus or a much quicker but more expensive cab. A fare increase might make the difference. <PARAGRAPH> I asked a driver waiting for a woman to stumble out of his cab on Bleecker Street at night what he thought of the fare increase. As the passenger apparently struggled to find enough change in her purse to cover the fare, he didn’t answer me directly but said with dry humor, “This is our life.” <PARAGRAPH> CBS quoted driver Qaiser Hashmi, who said the fare increase could change his life, compensating for the way he’s been squeezed by an escalating cost of living since the drivers’ last fare hike eight years ago: “I wouldn’t call it luxury, but at least I’ll be able to live a comfortable life.” <PARAGRAPH> The New York victory will likely inspire organized Chicago cab drivers, who are battling with Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration—including the use of short weekly strikes— for fare increases and a roll-back of new rules which they say gut their ability to make a living, as Jeremy Gantz reported for Working In These Times. <PARAGRAPH> Meanwhile, as Michelle Chen recently reported for Working In These Times, New York cab drivers have been unfairly swept up in campaigns against sex trafficking, potentially forcing cab drivers to profile people based on their attire and actually making sex work even more dangerous. Chen wrote: <PARAGRAPH> Taxi drivers are vulnerable to violent attacks, punishing work schedules, and a labor structure that forces drivers into virtual vehicular serfdom. The city's anti-prostitution crackdown ironically does place prostitutes and cabbies on the same side of the law, but for reasons probably not anticipated by the City Council: both sex workers and taxi drivers have seen their labor devalued and tarred with stereotypes of criminality, when in reality they’re just, like most other New Yorkers, trying to make an honest living.
Chicago Coal Gasification Plant: Good Jobs or Bad Gas? | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> CHICAGO—“Governor Quinn, these construction boots we’re wearing are made for working. Governor Quinn, we put these boots to work to get you elected. Governor Quinn, put these construction boots to work and sign this bill.” <PARAGRAPH> So said Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters business representative Daniel McMahon, standing outside the State of Illinois building on July 9, wearing a hard hat and surrounded by burly union members brandishing signs reading “We Need Jobs and Investment.” <PARAGRAPH> McMahon and local elected officials were calling on the Illinois governor to sign SB 3766, a bill that will allow the company Leucadia National Corporation to recover 100 percent of construction costs for a coal gasification plant it wants to build on the city’s southeast side.  As things currently stand, it can recover 84 percent of construction costs by charging customers with Nicor Gas and Ameren for the synthetic natural gas the plant will produce.  The company says the plant will not be built without the bill's passage. Critics argue that the plant is a bad deal for ratepayers, who will be committed to purchase the gas for 30 years at rates which could end up significantly above market rates. <PARAGRAPH> The plant is projected to create 1,000 temporary construction jobs, 200 permanent jobs and 600 to 700 indirect jobs in Chicago, plus about 200 coal mining-related jobs downstate. Under legislation signed last summer, the plant would use at least 50 percent Illinois coal and up to 50 percent petroleum coke from oil refineries, turning it into gas that can be used instead of natural gas for residential and industrial customers. <PARAGRAPH> “This bill not only benefits the city of Chicago, it benefits downstate,” said State Sen. Donne E. Trotter, referring to the state's mining industry. “We’re using our natural resources.” <PARAGRAPH> McMahon and Millwrights business rep John Dunne said the jobs created in Chicago would almost surely be union and would be an economic salvation for the struggling southeast side. He said the unions would make sure local residents were trained in the kind of skills needed for the jobs. <PARAGRAPH> Hoyt Hudson, a representative for the Chicago Clean Energy project  as the plant is known , said that if the bill is passed, jobs will be created next year to carry out the $25-30 million brownfield remediation the company has promised to do on the site, a former coke plant. Actual construction of the gasification plant still depends on many uncertain factors including permitting, financing and the construction of a pipeline to carry carbon dioxide to the Gulf Coast. <PARAGRAPH> McMahon accused opponents of the plant of being “special interest groups” from outside the community. But on July 10, scores of local residents turned out to urge Quinn to veto the bill, presenting 11,250 petitions to that effect. They say the gasification plant offers the wrong kind of jobs for an area that is already heavily polluted from decades of heavy industry, much of it now closed up. Even though the plant’s emissions of toxic pollutants would be low, critics note that residents and workers would be exposed to harmful diesel emissions from trucks and machinery and dust from the transportation and storage of coal and petroleum coke. <PARAGRAPH> Environmentalists also oppose the creation of coal mining jobs, pointing to reports like the recent investigation by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity blaming unethical coal companies and lax government oversight for continued high rates of black lung disease.  The United Mineworkers of America, by contrast, is pushing for development of more so-called “clean coal” projects like the gasification plant.  <PARAGRAPH> “We want jobs, but we want jobs that won’t kill us,” said Robert Garcia, 35, a student who lives on the southeast side and is looking for work. “If more polluting industries come in, it will be harder to attract the kind of clean jobs we want.” <PARAGRAPH> “This is the wrong kind of investment,” added Rev. Zaki L. Zaki, superintendent of the Northwest District of the United Methodist Church. “We need to be intentional about creating a green energy hub. The south side of Chicago presents itself as the perfect place. There are a whole range of green technologies we could see here, research centers, actual energy generation, solar and wind production. If anyone can dream big, it’s we as Chicagoans.”
Rio Tinto Smelter Workers, United Steelworkers Reach a Deal | <PARAGRAPH> <PICTURE> <PARAGRAPH> On July 5, the United Steelworkers ratified an agreement ending the six-month-plus lockout of about 780 union workers at Rio Tinto’s Alma smelter in Quebec, a struggle that gained widespread international solidarity and became emblematic of labor struggles in the modern metals industry. Though details of the settlement have still not been made public, on its website the union called it “a great victory for the workers and their supporters around the world.” <PARAGRAPH> USW President Leo Gerard was quoted saying: <PARAGRAPH> We were forced to take on the third-largest mining company in the world and we won… Many thought this was impossible, given the power imbalance, but we sent a message to the resource industry throughout the world that workers and their unions can take on huge multinational corporations to stop unjust demands. <PARAGRAPH> The stand-off started last fall around issues including the company’s intention to replace retiring union workers with non-union contractors. According to the USW website, this was addressed in the settlement, which applies through 2015:  The new contract rejects Rio Tinto’s demand. Contracting out will be strictly managed and limited for the collective agreement’s duration.  <PARAGRAPH> Since the lockout, the plant has been operating at about two-thirds capacity, but that reportedly has not been a major blow to Rio Tinto—which acquired the smelter as part of its acquisition of Alcan in 2007—since the economic crisis has driven down demand for metals. The agreement apparently comes just in time for the company, as demand may now be picking up again, despite the Eurozone crisis. <PARAGRAPH> The smelter lockout had been a centerpiece of an  Off the Podium  campaign, which argues that by supplying metal for 4,700 medals from its Utah and Mongolia mines, Rio Tinto is sullying the ideals of the Olympic Games beginning soon in London. Reportedly more than 13,000 people signed a petition demanding Rio Tinto not be part of the Games. <PARAGRAPH> USW Quebec director Guy Farrell was previously quoted as saying: <PARAGRAPH> Locking out its workers in Quebec is a violation of Rio Tinto's obligations to fair play under the Olympic Charter. The effort by this company to drive down living wages at one of the most profitable aluminum smelters in the world is a dangerous precedent for workers and families everywhere. Rio Tinto is not Olympic calibre in its behaviour towards its own workers and their families. The company demands unrealistic concessions from employees, and locks them out when they don't concede. It pollutes the air and water in communities around the world. It has no place alongside the world's greatest athletes – it's time to get Rio Tinto off the Olympic podium. <PARAGRAPH> Activists have also opposed the Games' sponsorship by BP and Dow Chemicals, part of the Greenwash Gold campaign launched by a former sustainability director for the Games, Meredith Alexander. The group’s website quotes Alexander saying: <PARAGRAPH> The Olympics are meant to be about so much more than how fast Usain Bolt can run or how many medals Britain's finest athletes score. The modern Olympics was founded here in the UK to promote peace and understanding between the peoples of the world. The Olympic values are all about celebrating our common humanity. <PARAGRAPH> Even with the settlement, the union expects more acrimonious disputes with the company. On the USW website, USW Canadian national director Ken Neumann says: <PARAGRAPH> The USW will continue working with unions around the world to demand that Rio Tinto respect workers' and human rights and the environment…We know there will be new attacks by Rio Tinto on trade unions and communities. The Steelworkers will be there to help them resist Rio Tinto's assaults.
Fox News obsessed with lone Black Panther | On the most important day in American politics, one of Fox News’s biggest stories has been about a lone New Black Panther Party member standing outside a Philadelphia polling place. <paragraph> Fox News has featured several segments today on Jerry Jackson, who was charged in 2008 for voter intimidation, although the charges against him were later dropped. Jackson was spotted outside a Philadelphia polling place Tuesday morning, and Fox News confirmed <hyperlink>  Jackson is a designated poll watcher. <paragraph> Fox News's  Fox & Friends  kicked off the coverage of the New Black Panther Party today at 8 a.m. with an interview with Get Out The Vet's Ben Brink about how Navy SEALs and other veterans will  fight back  against such voter intimidation from the New Black Panther Party. About 10 minutes later, Fox News's Gretchen Carlson introduced video of the man standing outside the polling place. <paragraph>  This is a member of the Black Panthers standing guard outside a polling place in Philadelphia. Does it look reminiscent? Remember this from four years ago? The organization said it was thinking about monitoring the election. Critics say it's more like intimidation. The Black Panthers also stood guard at polling places in 2008 in Philly, the group's leader with a night stick in his hand. It looks very similar,  she said. <paragraph> On  Fox & Friends,  conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and Fox News legal analyst Peter J. Johnson, Jr. also discussed the New Black Panther Party member. <paragraph> During  America's Newsroom,  Fox News’s Martha MacCallum played some “new video” of the New Black Panther Party member “standing guard outside a polling place opening doors as voters come through there to place their votes” and noted that a Fox News reporter tried to ask him about his role there. <paragraph> “We got only a ‘no comment’ from this gentleman,” MacCallum said. “You may recall a big story that unfolded, this is the tape back from 2008. The New Black Panther Party members were accused of voter intimidation in Philadelphia back then. One of them was seen holding a billy club outside of that polling place. So what does this mean this morning?” <paragraph> MacCallum then held a discussion on the topic with Fox News contributors Bill Kristol and Deroy Murdock. Later on, Fox News also conducted an interview with the Rev. Jesse Jackson about the New Black Panther Party member. <paragraph> 
NYT leads coverage on incoming CEO | The New York Times continues to provide in-depth reporting on the questions facing its incoming chief executive Mark Thompson over his role in the BBC’s Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal. <paragraph> In a Nov. 4 piece “As Scandal Flared, BBC’s Leaders Missed Red Flags <hyperlink> ,” the Times reported on Thompson’s history at BBC, his various statements regarding the spiked Savile investigation and the circumstances surrounding his hiring at the Times. The Times's investigation editor Matthew Purdy noted that the controversy surrounding the canceled “Newsnight” investigation “has shaken the solid reputation Mr. Thompson had when he left the BBC on Sept. 14.” <paragraph> “Interviews with former BBC executives and officials here in London show that in the months after the investigation was canceled, Mr. Thompson and his top executives repeatedly missed opportunities to pursue a fuller picture of the ‘Newsnight’ reporting, the fate of the program and, perhaps, of Mr. Savile,” the Times reported. <paragraph> “Whether through a series of near misses or a more deliberate avoidance, the executives failed to confront questions about Mr. Savile and the possibility that, in decades past, the BBC was somehow complicit in his behavior,” the Times added. <paragraph> The lengthy article also featured quotes from an interview with Thompson conducted last week. Thompson told the Times that he knew little, if anything, about the investigation. <paragraph> But, as the Times reported, “it was not for lack of opportunity.” After the investigation was spiked, there were seven articles in the British press about Savile and the canceled program, and former executives told the Times that some of those articles were in press clippings sent to top BBC executives and that Thompson’s daily morning conference call often featured discussions of the included clippings. Thompson told the Times he did not read all of the clippings and did not recall seeing those reports in any of the packets. <paragraph> Thompson, who is set to start work at the Times on Nov. 12, maintained that his public statements <hyperlink> on the matter have never changed. <paragraph> “I honestly believe I did nothing wrong,” he told the Times. <paragraph> And Media columnist Michael Wolff <hyperlink>  argues that the Times’ public editor, Margaret Sullivan, “largely deserves the credit for the brouhaha,” pointing to her call for the publication to “thoroughly” and aggressively report the story. <paragraph> “Thompson, in fact, will not have a journalism role at the Times; so, it is quite unclear how Sullivan's mandate reaches him,” Wolff wrote. “But her pointing to a guilt by association, of the Times with Thompson, and Thompson with the BBC, and the BBC with sex abuse, certainly seemed damning – albeit rather more in a New York Post than a New York Times manner.”
MSNBC's Alex Witt rips Judd Gregg for bailing on interview | MSNBC’s Alex Witt told viewers Saturday that Judd Gregg ditched their planned interview when the network decided to show part of President Barack Obama’s speech live because he  didn’t want to listen to the president and wait through the duration.  <paragraph> The host teased an interview with Gregg during her show “Weekends with Alex Witt,” saying that the former New Hampshire Republican senator and governor would join her shortly to discuss avoiding the fiscal cliff. <paragraph> “Will Republicans work with the president if he is re-elected? That interview is coming up in just a few minutes,” she said. <paragraph> Witt then ran through some top news stories and cut to a reporter covering the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York City. After the segment wrapped, the show went to commercial, and on its return, played about five minutes of Obama’s speech live. As MSNBC cut from the speech back to Witt, she announced Gregg had bailed on the show. <paragraph> “I wanted to let all of you know that we had teased the fact that former Republican senator and governor from New Hampshire Judd Gregg was going to speak with us,” she said. “I would like to let you know that he declined to stick around. He was plugged in, ready to go and he said he didn't want to listen to the president and wait through the duration to wait and speak with us.” <paragraph>  What just brings to mind for me is the possibility of spirit of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill when you have those kinds of sentiments being shared,  she added. <paragraph> 
WaPo eds: Romney campaign insults voters | The Washington Post's editorial board on Friday attacked Mitt Romney’s campaign as insulting to Americans, telling readers the Republican  seems to be betting that voters have no memories, poor arithmetic skills and a general inability to look behind the curtain  and that they hope Tuesday's results  prove him wrong.  The editorial board kicked off the blistering item by writing that “through all the flip-flops, there has been one consistency in the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney: a contempt for the electorate.” The editorial then goes through a long list of complaints as it hits Romney for not releasing his bundlers and tax returns, his recent ad about Jeep jobs going to China, “his refusal to lay out an agenda” and “his chronic, baldly dishonest defense of mathematically impossible budget proposals.”“Within limits, all candidates say and do what they have to say and do to win,” the editorial board wrote. “Mr. Obama also has dodged serious interviews and news conferences. He has offered few specifics for a second-term agenda. He, too, aired commercials that distorted his opponent’s statements. But Mr. Obama has a record; voters know his priorities. His budget plan is inadequate, but it wouldn’t make things worse.”“Mr. Romney, by contrast, seems to be betting that voters have no memories, poor arithmetic skills and a general inability to look behind the curtain. We hope the results Tuesday prove him wrong,” the board wrote.
Brian Williams knocks Rush Limbaugh | NBC’s Brian Williams on Thursday knocked Rush Limbaugh for his comments about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, telling “Rock Center” viewers that the radio show host’s statements are proof “politics survived” the storm. <paragraph> After praising Christie for his “tactile and indefatigable” response, Williams laid into the radio host for his comments about the governor. Among other things, Limbaugh this week has called Christie a “Greek column” for President Barack Obama who has been showing  man love  for the president and has gone  overboard in praising a failed president  for political purposes. <paragraph>  So after all this loss you might be curious as to why Rush Limbaugh went after Gov. Christie today,  Williams said.  It was because he’s getting along so well with the president, working together, saying nice things about Barack Obama. Just when we feared the storm wiped away everything, we learned politics survived.” <paragraph> “Proof that life goes on,” he added after the segment wrapped. <paragraph> During his monologue, Williams also blasted former FEMA director Michael Brown for saying the lesson of Hurricane Sandy is that people need to “chill out.” <paragraph>   Something we intend to pass along to these homeowners in Mantaloking, New Jersey, as soon as the embers from their homes have thoroughly cooled,  Williams said, adding that Brown was responsible for the “largest domestic human rights outrage of the modern era, the Katrina response.” 
Media: Obama in fighting mood | Top journalists and pundits reviewing the debate said Monday night it was clear President Barack Obama had come to the final faceoff spoiling for a fight with Mitt Romney, while the Republican nominee sought to fend off the attacks and maintain his momentum. <paragraph> “I thought in the middle of the debate that if I had been on the desert island for the last four years and I had just been parachuted into this debate, I would have thought the guy that had turned out to be Mitt Romney was the president protecting a lead and that Barack Obama was the challenger trying, somewhat desperately to catch up,” Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace said. “Obama was slashing, was personal, was cutting.” <paragraph>  His Fox News colleague Brit Hume agreed, saying that Obama had a “very intent look on his face” like a “man looking for opportunities to strike.” <paragraph> On CNN, Candy Crowley, the moderator of the second presidential debate, said the candidates had two very different objectives tonight: Obama came to “rough up” Romney, while the Republican was seeking to preserve his new-found momentum. <paragraph>  “I think the president came to rough up Mitt Romney,” Crowley said. “I think he acted like a person that had to sort of stop some momentum by Romney. He went after him — ‘you’re all over the map, that’s not what you said before’ — I mean, almost every single answer from the president had something to do with Mitt Romney. I feel as though Mitt Romney approached this like a physician, first do no harm. I feel like he didn’t come in to necessarily win. I think he came in, you know, as a man who’s had a certain amount of momentum over the past three, four weeks since that first debate and not wanting to ruin it.” <paragraph>  NBC’s David Gregory also described the debate in terms of the president angling for a battle. The president was “determined to pick a fight” with Romney, who was “surprisingly, determined to avoid a fight, playing almost as if he was ahead, determined to sound more moderate, to disagree less with the president on foreign policy,” said the “Meet the Press” host. <paragraph> CNN’s Wolf Blitzer noted that except for a few “rhetorical flourishes,” there wasn’t much difference between the two candidates on foreign policy, he said. <paragraph> “This was a debate where they wound up agreeing, even though there were nuances of disagreement, they wound up basically in terms of the big picture agreeing on a lot, on Iran, on Israel, on Afghanistan Libya, Syria, even on China, basically the thrust was one of agreement, even though at times they had little rhetorical flourishes against each other,” Blitzer said. <paragraph> The Atlantic’s James Fallows also pointed out the similarities between the two candidates on foreign policy, writing that “it was more striking as a matter of substance that on virtually no issue did Romney make an actual criticism, of any sort, of Obama’s policy or record. Including topics where he used to disagree, like the timeline for withdrawal for Afghanistan! Instead it was, ‘I agree, but you should have done it better.’” <paragraph>  Meanwhile MSNBC’s Chris Matthews said Romney “had a strategy tonight — avoiding looking like a radical.” <paragraph> “Avoiding the statements he’s made throughout the primaries and caucuses that put him on the far right, in terms of looking a bit dangerous. He pulled back, pulled back, pulled back,” the “Hardball” host said. <paragraph> And his MSNBC colleague Ed Schultz called the debate a win for Obama and blasted Romney as giving the “worst performance of any Republican candidate on foreign policy that I can ever remember.”   
Larry King says Gary Johnson should have been on stage with Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama — but the libertarian presidential nominee’s only chance to debate comes during the third party showdown that King will moderate on Tuesday. <paragraph>  The talk show host, who is moderating the Free & Equal Elections Foundation’s independent candidate debate, said he thinks any candidate who is on the ballot in at least 40 states should be invited to all the major sanctioned debates. <paragraph>   “I would say if you’re on the ballot in 40 states, you should be in the debates,” King told POLITICO. “And Gary Johnson is, and therefore in my opinion he should have been in these debates. You’re on the ballot in 40 states, absolutely.” <paragraph>  King said he realizes the issues the debate commission and the TV networks would face if they invited every independent candidate — “I mean what are you going to do, are you going to have eight candidates on running for president?” <paragraph>  And King agreed to moderate the Tuesday event in order to give all the independent candidates “a voice” they’ve been denied thus far in the 2012 campaign, he said. For the independent candidates who have confirmed they’ll attend the Chicago debate — Johnson, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Constitution Party candidate Virgil Goode and Justice Party candidate Rocky Anderson — this is their sole chance to present their platforms to voters on a major stage. <paragraph>  Viewers can tune into the third party debate on Tuesday night at 8 p.m. EST on C-SPAN, Al Jazeera English and Russia Today, and streamed online at Ora TV and on the Free & Equal debate site. <paragraph>  “I think they deserve a voice,” King said of the third-party candidayes. “It’s obvious they’re not going to win, but in the Constitution it never says there’s a Democrat or a Republican Party. It never mentions a two-party system. We’ve had Federalist presidents, Whig presidents. … We’ve always had independent candidates. They deserve a voice and they haven’t had a voice in this campaign at all.” <paragraph>  But will King vote for one of the independent candidates he’ll question Tuesday night? <paragraph>  “No, this time around I will not vote for an independent candidate,” King said. “I never say who I’m voting for, but I think they should be heard, they have a right to be heard, they have issues that should be brought up. For example, the war on drugs has never been mentioned in this campaign. That’s an important issue.”  
Abroad, much to dislike at debate | Media organizations around the world covered Monday’s final presidential debate in-depth, zeroing in on whether Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama appropriately addressed both America’s relationship with their own countries and the United States’s role on the world stage. <paragraph>  Iran’s state-run Press TV led its news story by stating that both candidates “pledged commitment to the Israeli regime’s interests.” Romney and Obama each “expressed strong support for Israel, the only possessor of nuclear arms in the Middle East” as they falsely characterized Iran’s own nuclear program, Iran’s Press TV wrote. <paragraph> “They accused Iran of seeking nuclear weapons despite the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  has never found any evidence of diversion in Tehran’s nuclear energy program toward military purposes. The Islamic Republic has repeatedly stated that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes,” the state-run media wrote on its website. <paragraph> China’s state news agency Xinhua wrote in its news article on the debate that “with their fate hung in the air in a dead heat campaign, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Republican foe Mitt Romney Monday night spared no effort to flail one another on foreign policy issues.” Obama “pummeled his challenger relentlessly over his inconsistencies on foreign policy.” <paragraph> And in the column “China Voice,” Xinhua writer Liu Jie said both Romney and Obama “framed China as a partner for the first time, offering a speck of belated comfort as the country had been portrayed as a monetary cheat and a job thief in their previous face-offs” — but that overall, the presidential debate “has fallen into a vanity fair for China-bashers who compete to denigrate China, which in fact has little to do with China but everything to do with the losing competitiveness of the world’s superpower.” <paragraph> “A few relieving words, however, are quickly overshadowed by traditional campaign tricks of scapegoating and ill-grounded hypotheses,” Liu Jie wrote. “The U.S. president-in-waiting, no matter who is elected, lacks deep understanding of how partners should treat each other.” <paragraph>  “They have relentlessly blamed China to cover up their own inabilities to put the domestic economy on track, regardless of the truth,” Liu Jie added. “The tactic only serves to reveal that the world’s superpower, indeed or temporarily, is running out of ways to sort out the real problems. Bashing China is a much easier and more convenient foil to score political gains.” <paragraph> Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Israeli journalist and political analyst Chemi Shalev, the U.S. foreign correspondent for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, blasted Romney in his column “West of Eden” as the “Etch-a-Sketch” candidate who brought “expedient political reconfiguration to new and dizzying heights” during the debate.  <paragraph> “Two weeks before the elections, it now turns out that Romney is actually a lovey-dovey peace on earth kind of candidate who agrees with President Barack Obama on just about everything: on Iraq, on Afghanistan, on Egypt, on Syria, on the use of drones against terrorists as well as crippling sanctions against Iran’s nuclear program,” Shalev wrote.  
Steve Coll joins Pulitzer Prize Board | New Yorker writer Steve Coll, Miami Herald executive editor Aminda “Mindy” Marqués Gonzalez and playwright Quiara Alegría Hudes have been elected to the Pulitzer Prize Board, Columbia University announced Tuesday. <paragraph> Coll, who has written seven books, joined the New Yorker in 2005 after 20 years with The Washington Post. He is a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize — he first won in 1990, for Explanatory Reporting, for a series of articles with David A. Vise about the Securities and Exchange Commission and again in 2005, this time for General Nonfiction for his book “Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the C.I.A., Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, From the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001.” Marqués Gonzalez serves as the vice president and executive editor of The Miami Herald. She started her journalism career as an intern at The Herald and has spent her journalism career — save for a five-year stint as Miami bureau chief for People magazine — at the paper as a reporter and editor. <paragraph> Hudes won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2012 for “Water by the Spoonful.” <paragraph>  There are 19 members of the board, which is made up of journalists and news executives, as well as five academics or people involved in the arts. The chair rotates annually and voting members can serve a maximum of nine years.  
AP, networks change exit poll strategy | TV networks and The Associated Press are changing their election night exit poll system in order to save money and account for increased early voting, according to a report. <paragraph> Exit polling will be limited in 19 states for the consortium of media organizations made up of the AP, ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News Channel and NBC, the AP reported <hyperlink>. The consortium announced that while it is reducing in-person exit polls, telephone polling will be increased this year in order to compensate for the rise in early voting and cell phone use. <paragraph>  “To save money this year, the consortium is doing bare bones exit polling in 19 states,” the AP's David Bauder wrote. “Enough voters will be questioned in those states to help predict the outcome of races, but not enough to draw narrative conclusions about the vote — what issues mattered most to women voting for Mitt Romney, for instance, or how many Catholics voted for Barack Obama.” <paragraph>  The AP notes that the affected states are Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming, as well as D.C. Some states that are not presidential battlegrounds will get a full exit poll, such as in the case of Massachusetts with its close Senate race. <paragraph>  The consortium did not release spending figures, according to the AP, but did announce it will interview 25,000 voters this year. In 2008, 18,000 voters were polled.
